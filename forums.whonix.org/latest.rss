          <title>Tor Not Connecting in Whonix</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been having issues connecting to tor. I am newish to qubes whonix and have seen other topics similar but they differed slightly and no troubleshooting has worked thus yet. First day of downloading qubes 4.1 was able to connect to tor for several hours, but since then have not been able connect. When using bridges, tor configuration gets stuck at 2% “Connected to pluggable transport” OR 10% “Connecting to relay”. When they get stuck here, there is no further movement. Seems like 1/10 times tor show connected without bridges, but whonix icon still shows the open lock and tor browser still does not connect.</p>
<p>sdwdate log viewer shows:</p>

<p>is local system time the same as sys-whonix UTC time? Must I adjust time in sys-whonix to match local time?</p>
<p>Now when running systemcheck in sys whonix gui:</p>
<p>systemcheck gave up waiting.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Connection 10 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=10 TAG=conn_done SUMMARY=“Connected to a relay” WARNING=“TLS_ERROR” REASON=TLS_ERROR COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore HOSTID=“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” HOSTADDR=“XX.XX.XXX.XX:XXX”</p>
<p>Though not advised I have manually adjust time in  forward and backwards 2 hours just to see if anything would change but no changes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to this helpful community if anyone is able to assist in troubleshooting. Learning qubes daily and the fact of this obstacle with tor puts a damper on it.</p>
<p>edit: am able to connect through debian 11/fedora 36 browser, just not through tor. since updates were configured over tor I cannot update to see if, because no tor connection.</p>

            <h2>
<a name="overview-1" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#overview-1"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>I have been doing some research on other FOSS privacy tool projects, and had a very nice conversation with a person who was on the <a href="http://privacyguides.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">privacyguides.org</a> team. He pointed out that UX/UI could be improved upon a lot on the main site/wiki, and thinks doing so would have a meaningful impact on usage and interest in Whonix.</p>
<p>I agree with this sentiment, and would like to help.</p>
<h4>
<a name="ideas-2" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#ideas-2"></a>Ideas</h4>
<p>Firstly, I think that many of the stock images and graphics take away a bit from the usability of the site. If you look at <a href="http://grapheneos.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">grapheneos.org</a>, it has a very simple layout with straightforward “click and install” front and center. I think something like this is a great idea for the Whonix site.</p>
<p>IMO many of the stock images and logos are a bit dated, and a little cheesy. This is not intended to be a dig at anyone who did this work, and the Whonix site is an AMAZING resource. I simply think it could benefit from a bit of tidying up.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am curious how the pages are hosted? The wiki is easy to find, but what about the home page? I think having a singular website repo using a static site generator (jekyll, hugo, etc) would be a good way to standardize the layout and increase maintainability. This would make it easier to focus on documentation and HTML/CSS separately.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think the welcome page in TOR should ask for donations front and center, in the same way that TAILS does. TAILS project kindly requests donations and saying something similar to this “Whonix is entirely free, and relies on user donations. If all users of Whonix gave just $5, we could make a great impact in keeping users free and secure for many years to come.”</p>
<h4>
<a name="commitment-3" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#commitment-3"></a>Commitment</h4>
<p>After I get my CI project running WATS, I am happy to tackle this project, and get the site more concise and clean. My partner is a graphic designer, and I could probably get a little bit of help with some custom/unified graphics on some areas that might need them.</p>
<p>It would be nice as this unfolds to try to discern outdated information and what needs to be archived</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/sunglasses.png?v=12" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

            <p>I’m confused after reading about the state file. I have a reason to regenerate it on the odd occasion so it would be good to know if I need to delete the whole state folder or just the state file. In the wiki “Tor Entry Guards” (I can’t add this link) it mentions them interchangeably. I guess it would depend on what the use case is but I think in some cases even if you change your entry guards then you might still be identifiable because of the other things you have cached. Say I go offline for a week then the amount of data I have to fetch when I come back online is a predictable amount as opposed to if I delete the whole state folder and refetch everything. Does this sound right or is it just the state file to worry about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Qubes OS is a desktop operating system that follows the principle of security through compartmentalization. In spirit, it is closely related to Genode. In contrast Genode’s clean-slate approach of building a fine-grained multi-component system, Qubes employs Xen-based virtual machines as sandboxing mechanism. In version 3.0, Qubes introduced a Hypervisor Abstraction Layer, which decouples Qubes from the underlying virtualization platform. This exploration project pursues the goal of replacing Xen by Genode as virtualization layer for Qubes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since Qubes and Genode both utilize a network of sandboxed virtual containers each running its own operating system, I’m toying with the idea of replacing Qubes OS with Sculpt OS (Genode’s flagship) as the host for the Whonix gateway and workstation. Has anyone tried this before? Is there a reason why it shouldn’t be done?</p>

            <p>I somehow managed to install onionshare 2.6 from source into  kicksecure morphed debian 11 computer. ( I know this is whonix, thats my test cpu.)  What you get is instructions and scripts.</p>
<p>Be security minded with downloads.  What you will need is python3,<br>
python3-pip. Next is poetry-python and add to PATH.  Next is tor-browser, but the script needs to updated to the latest version.  Then config or setup.</p>
<p>Will this install in whonix?  I have no idea.  Not versed enough in linux to say it will. Success in one thing does not translate into another.</p>
<p>Just saying thanks to the devs for this app.  Learning something new. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

            <p>I upgraded whonix from terminal and now I can not start the workstation.<br>
Gateway starts fine, but workstation starts with username and password (which it has never asked for before).</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.<br>
I have tried user and changeme, but it does not seem to work.</p>

            <p>I can’t reproduce this issue on my other 2 ubuntu vbox VM’s, so it seems to be specific to whonix. When I’m playing short videos on VLC or MPV inside whonix 16.0.8.2 for vbox, I notice videos will a lot of times either be high pitched or low pitched until I restart the VM (it can take several restarts before the pitch issue goes away). I’ve tried from 10gb of RAM to 2gb of ram allocated to the VM and 2-3 CPUs allocated, but it doesn’t seem to have an effect.</p>
<p>Also had this issue on older whonix versions as well.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
My Problem is, that I am running out of RAM in host live mode so that I can’t even run Gateway and Workstation at the same time and I am getting the error with “No space left on device”.<br>
I have used Whonix in the same setup on the same Computer before about one year ago. Back then I could run Gateway + 3x Workstation at once. It was Debian 11 and Whonix 16 as well.</p>
<p>I would like to understand why this is the case. Does anyone have a clue? I reinstalled all from scrap, so I also might have done a mistake there.</p>
<p>System memory:16GB<br>
Gateway memory: 512MB<br>
Workstation memory: 1,5GB</p>

            <p>The icon in the upper left corner that drops down to show applications is now gone with most recent whonix update. I have seen this on two different workstation vm’s so it is not a error with an update. The only way i can even go to applications now is right click desktop and carefully open the submenus. If it werent for that feature i would be locked out of every program. Is there any way to get this back?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the big advantage of a git (or any) server self-hosted by Whonix compared to any git branch in any git repository anywhere or git patch format? And is the extra effort really justified for the maintenance required for that webapp? Maintenance required: initial setup, keeping it updated, backups and restoration testing, archival, troubleshooting if something breaks…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From my experience with other webapps…</p>
<ul>
<li>wordpress blog (updating was messy, kept breaking),</li>
<li>discourse forums (hard to resolve update issues, database issues),</li>
<li>mediawiki (update issues, database issues),</li>
<li>phabrictor (deprecated even though one would thing that’s unlikely given it was in use by at least two major users such as wikipedia and facebook)</li>
</ul>
<p>…that’s hours and hours of work that are spend on a perfect webserver rather than on software development.</p>
<p>More generally… Not just about git… Any webapp or server setup… The issue is that the demands from a small vocal minority of highly technical users lead a lot of project resources being redirected that aren’t really beneficial for the core of Whonix which is the actual downloadable software or source code. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>all software on the server must only be using Freedom Software</li>
<li>ideally the server would be self-hosted in a developer’s private home (not hosted at a server provider)</li>
<li>JavaScript free webapp or at least basic non-JavaScript support</li>
<li>the webapp must not have anti-features such as cookies, tracking</li>
<li>no loading of third-party content (such as fonts, CSS, scripts, let alone analytics)</li>
<li>no use of a CDN</li>
<li>the webapp must have perfect security</li>
<li>the webapp must be under constant development and be constantly updated by upstream and downstream</li>
</ul>
<p>These ideal-world requirements are commendable but realistically I wonder these have hold back too much the software development of Whonix. By comparison, the official Tor Project forums <a href="http://forums.torproject.net">forums.torproject.net</a>, by an organisation with much more funding, multiple full time staff, are currently cloud hosted by a third party, discourse which includes IP logging.

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey all, So i was trying to follow a tutorial on how to setup whonix KVM on a youtube video by Mental Outlaw on youtube and i’m stuck on the extraction part where I use the “tar” command to extract the archive but when I do it does not give me the Workstation iso but does give me the gateway iso. I’m confused as how to fix this and have been dealing with this for the past day trying to read the forums before i ask for help.</p>
<p>I attached a photo to this post so you can see where i’m at and point me in the right direction. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pLoRTrU" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Imgur: The magic of the Internet</a></p>

            <p>Hello, would love to see Whonix self hosting the git server.<br>
I have problems with github, they block certain providers and certain IPs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br>
Thank you for contacting GitHub Support.<br>
Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.<br>
In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.<br>
Our Terms of Service state that an individual may not maintain more than one:<br>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub Terms of Service - GitHub Docs</a><br>
We’ll need to leave this account flagged.<br>
Regards,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 reasons they replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mail provider censor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not try to create multiple free accounts.<br>
Probably IP based flag considering many people use the same exit node.</p>
<p>I chose an e-mail provider that does not require personal information nor signup without tor and could be done without javascript enabled.<br>
I could of course hop mail server till I find one that works, but that would solve the account problem, but not the bigger problem that is relying on github for everyone that wants to contribute and depending on giving enough information for 3rd party servers till they are satisfied.</p>
<p>I can of course try other git hosting solutions, but Whonix being hosted on a different server such as GitHub makes merge requests impossible, for someone to review the request, they would need to see a branch hosted on a different server and they would only be able to compare locally. Mail patches are also possible, but then that is a closed review process, with only one person seeing the patch before being applied, as there is not Whonix mailing list related to that.</p>
<p>Also, as discussions should happen here instead of git issues, the git server program does not need lots of features.</p>
<p>I hope this incite the git hosting to come sooner.</p>

          <title>How to disable DHCP in Whonix and ensure no leaks</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, I need to disable DHCP in Whonix, I have static IP on my host but running htop on my host shows dnsmasq is being ran with a “DHCP ip lease script”, which has the path to a binary with name “libvirtd_lease_script”. dnsmasq config file has DHCP disabled so the one running the binary is actually libvirtd, I managed to stop it by simply renaming the binary to “test” and killing dnsmasq</p>
<p>Now the problem is I am not sure if DHCP is disabled in Gateway, and most importantly that there were no leaks by me fiddling around with dnsmasq, so my question is actually 2 separate questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How to absolutely make sure that there are no leaks from Whonix ? is there a list of standard tests used by you to ensure that there are no leaks?</p>
</li>

<p>How to disable DHCP and set static IP for Whonix</p>

          <title>Tor Browser Alt-Svc as a potential huge anonymity threat</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[whonixgod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. HTTP specification has a header called <strong>Alt-Svc</strong> which can automatically redirect user to another network location on a server side <strong>without !!!</strong> even asking a user.</p>
<p>(Cannot post a link here, you can Google for Alt-Svc Developer Mozilla Org documentation page)</p>
<p>I personally faced that problem when I visited some kind of web sites which used third-party domains like Cloudflare. When using Tor Broswer, Cloudflare automatically redirects all traffic from clearnet cloudflare dot com domain to its .onion one (cflareblahblahblah… .onion) without asking a user! When I checked my IP address on that site (yes, using a standard Tor Browser on a Whonix-Workstation), it shown me not the IP address of Tor exit node but Cloudflare CDN US IP !!!</p>
<p>So, to turn that hidden redirection off, I need to type <code>about:config</code> and set the value of the option to <code>false</code>:</p>
<p><code>network.http.altsvc.enabled</code> → <code>false</code></p>
<p>I recommend Whonix developers to turn off <strong>Alt-Svc</strong> header by default because I think it is a potential dangerous feature which is dangerous for anonymity. I am not sure if Tor Project developers turn this option off.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I set Tor Browser to Safest mode and go to websites that I know for a fact have https SSL certificates, very often (like 40% of the time) it will tell me that it’s HTTP only, so I hit proceed.</p>
<p>Then once the site loads, it has a lock and appears to be a legit cert.</p>
<p>Is this SSL stripping of malicious exit nodes?  Why is it saying no HTTPS?</p>

          <title>Disabling default sys-net traffic necessary when moving networks?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[movingnetworks]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes-Whonix</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am trying to understand the Fingerprint wiki. There is a recommendation to prevent non-Tor connections when moving between networks. I don’t understand what this achieves? I understand that any non-Tor connections that uniquely  identify somebody (such as visiting obscurewebsite dot com or facebook dot com) should be prevented, but the recommendation seems to mean that we should disable all clearnet traffic. I am a Qubes user so this would mean even default sys-net traffic. If you were to do this then an ISP adversary would not be able to tell what OS you are using but only creating Tor traffic is a fingerprint equally as identifiable as the fingerprint of the OS default clearnet traffic.</p>
<p>I think the best you can do when moving networks is remove your state file but your OS will always be visible.</p>
<p>The only other reason I can think of for this recommendation is to prevent the attack where an adversary is able to link Tor and non-Tor traffic but this isn’t something specific to moving networks.</p>
<p>I can not link but it is /wiki/Fingerprint</p>
