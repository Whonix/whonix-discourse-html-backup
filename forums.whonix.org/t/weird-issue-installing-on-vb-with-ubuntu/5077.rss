    <description>Hello I recently installed virtual box on ubuntu and downloaded the gateway and workstation. I imported the files to virtual box and both start up fine. However, the two aren&#39;t linked. After I setup the gateway and then started the workstation it gave me an error that the gateway wasn&#39;t running even though it was. When I would try to run anything in the gateway, nothing would work. I couldn&#39;t run whonix check or anything. I tried restarting and had the same problem. What did I do wrong?</description>

<p>No, that if for clipboard sharing, shared folders etc. Would not cause the problems you are having.</p>
<p>How did you install VBox?  Did you use:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install virtualbox linux-headers-$(uname -r)</code></p>
<p>Did you change any settings in VBox such as the settings for memory? Speaking of that, something else you can try is allocating more memory for VMs in VBox settings.</p>

<p>You may also want use <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">rads</a> again but this time lower RAM to 512 MB in each VM. This is the minimum that is needed for the desktop to start. Any lower and you will get a terminal only Whonix.</p>
<p>I do not believe the problem is with Whonix. These kinds of problems are  typically RAM related although it could be something to do with VBox or even the host.</p>

            <p>Hi David</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying. Whonix-Gateway works fine until you start a second VM. I misinterpreted your first post.</p>
<p>This sound like a RAM issue</p>
<p>Are you running a lot of processes on your host OS while using Whonix?</p>
<p>Could you try shutting down anything you don’t need on the host while using Whonix. Does that help?</p>

            <p>Thanks. Yes, my Ubuntu is up to date.</p>
<p>To further elaborate, when I start the gateway, everything works fine and there is no error messages. Tor starts fine and when I run the whonix check, I updated everything.</p>
<p>Then I start the workstation and everything starts fine. But then I get that error that its not connecting to the gateway. So I go back to the gateway and when I click on anything its like its frozen. Nothing works.</p>
<p>It seems the work independently, but not together. Im not sure if this is a virtualbox issue or what.<br>
Also, not sure if this would affect it, but Im using libreboot for my bios. Not sure if that would affect anything.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>That error message is due to Whonix-Gateway not booting correctly. There is no Whonix-Gateway for Whonix-Workstation to link to.</p>
<p>When you first boot the VMs, do you see any error messages such as the ones here:</p>

<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>can you can run commands in Whonix-Workstation Konsole or use desktop apps? Works OK other than not having Whonix-Gateway to connect to?<br>
– if so, you <em>may</em> want to reinstall Whonix-Gateway. Even thought you verified the image something may have happened to the image afterward (corrupted??) But <strong>only</strong> after exhausting other possibilities i.e. further troubleshooting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is your host Ubuntu updated with the latest packages?</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get upgrade</code></p>

            <p>Hi <code>David</code></p>
<p>Sorry to hear you’re having problems. Could you please answer a few questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>did you <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line">verify</a> the Whonix images?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you have enough RAM for both your host OS and virtual machines?</p>
<ul>
<li>can you try running <strong>just</strong> Whonix-Gateway i.e. without Whonix-Workstation (does Gateway work?)</li>
<li>you may also need to increase you VM RAM. <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>is Whonix-Workstation functional?</p>
<ul>
<li>if no - could you trying creating a virtual machine with a different iso image. Such as Debian (works OK?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
