    <title>VirtualBox .vmdk file inaccessible</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-vmdk-file-inaccessible/3427</link>
    <description>While using a workstation, the program shut off abruptly, and upon going to the VirtualBox interface to start it again, it said &quot;Aborted&quot; instead of &quot;Powered Off&quot;. Following advice on the VirtualBox forum, I then went to the &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; folder on the host computer, removed the most recent &quot;.vbox&quot; file (which was a few KB in size), and replaced it with the &quot;previous&quot; file (I changed its extension from &quot;.vbox-prev&quot; to &quot;.vbox&quot; so that it would be recognized).

I now cannot access the .vmdk file (workstation) on VirtualBox. This error message appears:

&gt; **&quot;One or more virtual hard disks, CD/DVD or floppy disk image files are not currently accessible. As a result, you will not be able to operate virtual machines that use these files until they become accessible later.&quot;**

Although &quot;Aborted&quot; no longer appears (and it now says &quot;Powered Off&quot;), it is accompanied by the following in the storage display:

(Normal, **Inaccessible**)

It used to say this:

(Normal, 100.00 GB)

When I attempt to start the inaccessible workstation, this error message appears:

&gt; **&gt; Failed to open a session for the virtual machine Whonix-Workstation.**

&gt; **&gt; Could not open the medium &#39;/Users/computer/VirtualBox VMs/Whonix-Workstation/Whonix-Workstation-11.x.x.x.x-disk.vmdk&#39;.**

&gt; **&gt; VMDK: inconsistency between grain table and backup grain table in &#39;/Users/computer/VirtualBox VMs/Whonix-Workstation/Whonix-Workstation-11.x.x.x.x-disk.vmdk&#39; (VERR_VD_VMDK_INVALID_HEADER).**

&gt; **&gt; VD: error VERR_VD_VMDK_INVALID_HEADER opening image file &#39;/Users/computer/VirtualBox VMs/Whonix-Workstation/Whonix-Workstation-11.x.x.x.x-disk.vmdk&#39; (VERR_VD_VMDK_INVALID_HEADER).**

&gt; **&gt; Result Code:** 
&gt; **&gt; NS_ERROR_FAILURE (0x80004005)**
&gt; **&gt; Component: Medium**
&gt; **&gt; Interface: IMedium**

This error message has left me baffled and I have no idea how to access the workstation. For example, what is an &quot;invalid header&quot;, and how can that be fixed? What is &quot;NS_ERROR_FAILURE&quot;? And what is a &quot;grain table&quot;? I have no idea what any of these mean, and there are no instructions on how to fix the problem.

Also, in the &quot;Virtual Media Manager&quot;, the &quot;Virtual Size&quot; and &quot;Actual Size&quot; are displayed as blank (with &quot;--&quot; for both), even though the actual .vmdk file contains more than 6 GB.</description>
