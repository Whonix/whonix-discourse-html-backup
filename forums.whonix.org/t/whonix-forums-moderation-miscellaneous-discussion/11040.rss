    <description>This forum thread can be used to explain moderation action while not deflecting the main discussion in the original forum thread.

----

I&#39;ve just now split the post https://forums.whonix.org/t/antix-linux-distribution/11039 from http://forums.whonix.org/t/make-a-kicksecure-iso/10846/3 and moved it into its own forum thread https://forums.whonix.org/t/antix-linux-distribution/11039. It wasn&#39;t directly related to the Kicksecure ISO. However, feel free to post a link into that topic to the new forum thread.

Also for the new forum thread, free to change the title such as from

&gt; antiX Linux Distribution

to

&gt; antiX - Kicksecure Hardened Distribution looking for Artwork

since that seems to be the primary intention.

If you wish to discuss ` antiX Linux Distribution` generally, which could be interesting, since the first independent third party Linux distribution based on (parts of?) Kicksecure or being a Kicksecure fork.</description>
