    <description>`--gui kde` is the default and works but `--gui none` is broken and unmaintained for a while now. The implementation of that was more like an after thought and broken by design. (`--gui none` added packages to a skip list and was not a mandatory switch. The new design will be more declarative, i.e. `--some-switch` will be mandatory and opt-in things rather than disabling stuff. Just now finished cleaning up that code.

`./whonix_build supports` currently

* `--flavor whonix-gateway`
* `--flavor whonix-workstation`
* `--flavor whonix-custom-workstation`

I am considering new switches.

* `--flavor whonix-gateway-kde` (installs non-qubes-whonix-gateway package)
* `--flavor whonix-workstation-kde` (installs non-qubes-whonix-workstation package)
* `--flavor whonix-gateway-cli` (installs non-qubes-whonix-gateway-cli package, yet to be added to anon-meta-packages, same as above package without dependency on anon-shared-desktop as well without dependency on anon-shared-desktop-kde package)
* `--flavor whonix-workstation-cli` (similar to above)
* `--flavor whonix-custom-workstation`

Rather I am wondering if the following makes sense:

* `--flavor whonix-gateway-custom` (where the to be installed meta package[s] must be manually given using an environment or build config variable)
* `--flavor whonix-workstation-custom` (similar to above)

For Whonix development purposes it sometimes would be helpful to have plain Debian images available for download.

* `--flavor whonix-plain-debian-kde-minimal` (just Debian without any Whonix packages installed)
* `--flavor whonix-plain-debian-kde-whonix` (coming with whonix-repository, guest additions, grub config packages for apparmor, screen resolution and verbosity installed)

It&#39;s rather hard finding some sensible naming scheme for these command line switches. Any suggestions? Perhaps no switches for the non-default configurations and having the user enter the meta packages desired to be installed?

I also worry that deploying a plain Debian image through whonix.org would be easily confused having to do anything with anonymity. Is there a way to prevent that?</description>
