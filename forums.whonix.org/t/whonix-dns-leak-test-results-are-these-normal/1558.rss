    <title>Whonix DNS leak test results....Are these normal?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-dns-leak-test-results-are-these-normal/1558</link>
    <description>Hello so I decided to do a DNS leak test while on Whonix I tried 3 different sites the first was ​http://www.dnsleaktest.com/ which said that I was on an anonymous server.  Then I used www.ipleak.net which said I was in Canada but still no leaks.  

Then I tried ​http://www.ip-check.info which gave me the strangest results.  It said my IP location was in Zurich, why did the locations change?
Then it listed the following results:

Authentication: Protected       Rating: Good
HTTP sessuin: 10 minutes until your tor identity is changed.  Rating: Medium
Referer: Original websites may see what website you are coming from   Rating: Medium

Questions:

I use a browser spoofer on the clearnet is that tool also working on tor?  Is that why it says my tor ID will be changed in 10 minutes?

How can I get a higher rating on the referer section so that websites can&#39;t see where I am coming from.

Why did my location differ between websites?

Again I am very new to all of this I appreciate any input or analysis of what this means.

Thanks</description>

            <p>In short answering to the original post:<br>
Nothing to worry about. Don’t modify Tor Browser.</p>

Forget about https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Ip-check.info.
<blockquote>HTTP sessuin: 10 minutes until your tor identity is changed.  Rating: Medium</blockquote>
<blockquote>Referer: Original websites may see what website you are coming from   Rating: Medium</blockquote>

No. Whonix/Tor is not influenced by the underlying network connection. It works or it does not work.
<blockquote>Is that why it says my tor ID will be changed in 10 minutes?</blockquote>
Tor circuits expire by Tor design. This is normal.
Forget about https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Ip-check.info.
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Tor Browser deals with that. Modifications recommended against.<br>
Forget about <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Ip-check.info">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Ip-check.info</a>.<br>
Either read through all the existing discussions referer spoofing on <a href="http://torproject.org">torproject.org</a>, agree with them or if applicable, make an educated argument, or leave it as is.</p>
<blockquote>Why did my location differ between websites?</blockquote>
Different browser tabs are isolated from each other. Stream isolated.
(https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation)
Likely end up with different exit relays. Nothing to be worries about.

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>yes, simply enter “about:config” in the adress bar, accept the warning, look for “network.http.sendRefererHeader” and change it to 0. However, please keep in mind, that, doing this wrong may make your browser unstable and/or less safe.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>[quote=“new2this, post:3, topic:1558”]I just found it strange that on my clearnet Firefox browser spoofer I have the change of browser ID to change every 10 minutes which was the same as the time to change the tor exit node is that a coincidence?<br>
Thanks[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, the timing of ten minutes is just coincidence.</p>
<p>The only way a website can know where you were before is by HTML referrer headers or cookies. But that is an issue of configuring you browser, not Whonix.</p>

            <p>If you are using Whonix is all normal, the tor exit node change at specific time .<br>
There’s no leak on Whonix, expecially your IP, you Workstation doesn’t know your ip <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , only the gateway but it’s not which makes queries <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> , you are protected from Workstation .</p>
