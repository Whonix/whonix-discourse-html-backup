    <title>Problems setting up Whonix-Gateway with Whonix-Custom-Workstation w Windows7</title>

    <description>Hello

I have followed these instructions perfectly to set up a Windows-Whonix-Workstation:

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems#Introduction_2

This is where I am at:

I cannot complete the last step of the instructions, quoted below, as there are no local area connections as apparently there is no driver for the network card.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For Windows 7 (similar in Windows XP): In Control Panel -&gt; Network and Sharing Center: click on &quot;Change adapter settings&quot; Right-click on local area connection &gt; properties In property window: double-click Internet Protocol Version 4, use the following settings:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that when I make a totally new vm without using Whonix-Custom-Workstation, and simply install windows 7 from the .iso, I connect to the internet just fine (but without using tor or whonix)

Thanks for your help! I would really like to get this working.

Host OS is Mac os x
VM for tor use is Windows 7</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Did you download the Whonix-Custom-Workstation or manually create it yourself? In other words, did you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>“If you want to manually create a VirtualBox VM (old, stable way), click on expand on the right.” or</li>
<li>“If you want to download and import Whonix-Custom-Workstation template (experimental, testers-only), click on expand on the right.”</li>
</ul>
<p>I speculate the latter. I rather speculate, that the default virtual network card for self created VMs contains a network card supported by Windows while Whonix-Custom-Workstation might have set one that Windows does not support. Please compare those.</p>
<p>Try to change the virtual network card in VM settings. Re-installation of Windows may or may not be required for the new driver to be load.</p>
