    <title>Multiple Errors while Updating Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-errors-while-updating-gateway/3001</link>
    <description>Hey guys, thanks for working so hard in the service of privacy!
Unfortunately I&#39;m experiencing a few errors and your docs made me a little paranoid, and i don&#39;t know if I&#39;m gonna be safe or not.
Here&#39;s my situation:

* running whonix on virtualbox on win7
* using freshly downloaded images of v13.0.0.1.1
* both imported into VB as described here:
_whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_  [sry can only put 5 links as new forum member]
*only thing i changed was the gateways ram to 128mb as stated in the license agreement
(sadly my notebook has only 2gb ram :disappointed: )
now i wanted to update the gateway first, so i started its virtual machine:
* swapfile is being generated, login as user, whonixsetup starts
* hit &quot;understood&quot; 2times and then cancel since i&#39;ve experienced some issues w/ the setup before (yes, i tried to update the gateway multiple times already)
* enable the whonix repository by running:
[code]sudo whonix_repository --enable --repository stable[/code]
* next i manually edit /etc/tor/torrc:
[code]sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc[/code]
* uncomment &quot;DisableNetwork 0&quot; and save
* run the whonixsetup again (just so i don&#39;t miss anything):
[code]sudo whonixsetup[/code]
- &quot;i&#39;m ready to enable tor&quot;,&quot;ok&quot;,&quot;yes&quot; -&gt;&quot;Tor should already be enabled&quot;, &quot;ok&quot;-&gt;&quot;Tor was successfully restarted&quot;
* whonixcheck gives one warning(&quot;apt-get reports that packages can be updated&quot;), then exits
* after a reboot(just to be sure everything found it&#39;s place and is loaded correctly) i start updating:
[code]sudo apt-get update[/code]
* here i sometimes encounter an hrtimer interruption, see:
https://img5.picload.org/image/rddrrilc/sudoapt-getupdate_hrtimer.png . . . [-&gt;only 5 links]
(happens not always and update seems to proceed/finish normally)
- then:
[code]sudo apt-get dist-upgrade[/code]
- &quot;135 upgraded [..] need to get 171mb of archives [...] continue?&quot;, &quot;y&quot;
- downloads all 135 packages w/o any problems
- then i get an [&quot;sda1: write same failed&quot;-msg](https://picload.org/image/rddrdlog/sda1.png), but upgrade continues
- next thing i noticed is a &quot;failed to set capabilities&quot;-msg for the file /usr/bin/systemd-detect-virt
-and shortly after a dpkg error: &quot;dpkg status database is locked by another process&quot;; after this the upgrade exits: https://picload.org/image/rddrdlod/dpkgerror.png . . . [-&gt;5links]
- now i do a reboot, cuz i hope it will at least partly load the newly updated packages
- after login whonixcheck says i&#39;m connected to tor and exits
- since the strange exit of the update/upgrade, i run it again, first apt-get update, then apt-get dist-upgrade
- &quot;112 upgraded [..] 10 not fully installed or removed [...] need to get 0b/81,5mb of archives [...] continue?&quot;, &quot;y&quot;
-again the &quot;sda1&quot;-msg (just a different number in front of it)
-[a whole lot of unpacking]
- then a wild [hrtimer-interruption](https://picload.org/image/rddrdpac/hrtimer2.png), followed by lots more of unpacking
- next i get something about [unknown media types](https://picload.org/image/rddrcipr/unknownmediatype.png), after which the upgrade freezes(or at least doesn&#39;t log anything new anymore) for hours(8h+)
- then the upgrade exits with [this](https://picload.org/image/rddrcipa/breakdown.png)
- reboot
- now - even before logging into the user-account - i get [this](https://picload.org/image/rddrcipl/b4login.png), and after the login i still get messages like that at random intervals...

anyone know what&#39;s wrong?? how do i fix this? or is this nothing to worry about and i can go on to update the workstation?!

like i said, i&#39;ve done this updating process multiple times, always starting with a clean image.
but the outcome was always like this (course of events was not always the same, but very similar. e.g. upgrade didn&#39;t always freeze at that exact point, but always during the second upgrade)
hope i&#39;ve included enough info for you to help me ;)
thanks in advance.</description>

<p>If you are affected, bad luck. There is no solution for this on this on the Windows platform.</p>
<p>So your only option would be trying a Linux host.</p>
<p>Also starting with terminal-only as a Linux beginner is probably non-ideal.</p>
