    <title>Hidden service time sync problem</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/hidden-service-time-sync-problem/4674</link>
    <description>Host system is running Debian 9, kvm vm

For 28 days I&#39;ve had my hidden service running on my test server everything has worked fine until today, my hidden service would not load, after checking my whonix gateway I noticed the time sync had stopped after restarting both machines the hidden service started working again.

Previously I have noticed the time sync stops working every so often on my workstation machine, today was the first time it happened on the gateway.

Software I have installed on my workstation, nginx server, BTC core, forum software, nothing else. Is there any reason for this? Is there a fix?

Thanks in advance.</description>
