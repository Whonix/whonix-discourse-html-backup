    <title>Beginner question - No bootable device</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/beginner-question-no-bootable-device/13738</link>
    <description>Hello, I am very new to this, so apologies if I am making any obvious mistakes here.

I&#39;m trying to make whonix work via kvm. So far I have tried following the guide as closely as possible and simply trying to open the qcow2 images in Gnome Boxes to see what happens and in both cases I see the same kind of black screen with:


```
SeaBI0S (version rel-1....)
Machine UUID .....

iPXE (ipxe.org) 00:93.0 CAOO....


Booting from Hard Disk. .
Boot failed: not a bootable disk

No bootable device.
```

What could be the cause of this?</description>

            <p>I grabbed a random qcow2 image from another distro now and it seems to boot up just fine in both gnome boxes and with virt-manager, so it seems like my basic setup is workable.</p>
