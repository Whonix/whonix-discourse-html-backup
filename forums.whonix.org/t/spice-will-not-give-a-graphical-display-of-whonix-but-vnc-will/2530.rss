    <title>Spice will not give a graphical display of Whonix, but VNC will.</title>

    <description>Been trying to set up Whonix with KVM, but hit a bug that I was not able to resolve with searching the error. When starting either Whonix-Gateway or Whonix-Workstation with default XML and KVM (with graphical virt-manager) it gives the error:

[quote]Cannot display graphical console type &#39;spice&#39;: 
No module named SpiceClientGtk[/quote]

After some searching this error I have tried installing spice-client (with apt-get install spice-client) and it turned out it was indeed not installed during the KVM install (should it?). However this did not resolve this error.

After that I tried using another virtualization platform, VNC, by changing the Display type from Spice to VNC under &quot;Show virtual hardware details&quot;. This worked, Whonix with VNC gives a correct graphical display.


How could I resolve the Spice error? Or is using VNC instead of Spice a viable alternative and what security consequences will it have? Are those easy to migrate?</description>

            <p>Sounds like broken dependencies.</p>
<p>Try reinstalling the KVM packages to see if its resolved:</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install (kvm package names from wiki here)</p>
<p>VNC is NOT a viable alternative. It is neither secure nor performant.</p>
