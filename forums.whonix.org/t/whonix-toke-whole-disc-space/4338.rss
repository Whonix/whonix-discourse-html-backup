    <title>Whonix toke whole disc space!</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-toke-whole-disc-space/4338</link>
    <description>I created 12GB partition. Downloaded Gateway/Workstation. And I had still some space left on this partition. I was running it through VirtualBox and everything was OK for a few days.

But if I try to run Gateway right now, it will crash during startup. With error message &quot;Disc full&quot;. Because Whonix toke all free space in this 12 GB partition. There&#39;s literally no free space left. Gateway crashes during startup. Doesn&#39;t even start. Workstation crashes after 3 minutes of running.

I didn&#39;t download anything at Whonix. It has to be some updates or something like that.

What am I suppose to do?</description>
