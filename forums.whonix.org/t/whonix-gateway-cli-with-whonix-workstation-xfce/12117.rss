    <title>Whonix-Gateway-CLI with Whonix-Workstation-XFCE</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-gateway-cli-with-whonix-workstation-xfce/12117</link>
    <description>is it possible to use the whonix-gateway-cli with the whonix-workstation-xfce without using the xfce-gateway. will it work the same, any draw backs? is it as simple as downloading both the cli-gateway and the xfce-workstation and running the same as you would with the xfce workstation.

Can i use the whonix cli gateway with the whonix xfce work station, if so is there any set up i need to do or do i just need to download the cli gateway and run it with the xfce workstation?</description>
