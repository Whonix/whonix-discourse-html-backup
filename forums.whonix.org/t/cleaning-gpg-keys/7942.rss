    <title>Cleaning GPG Keys.</title>

    <description>AFAIK the recent attack on GPG of appeding a bunch of signatures to inflate its size causing client sot crash has been addressed upstream. meanwhile there are equivalent commands one can use with the older version to clean a key before importing to avoid this attack.

A PoC poisoning tool has been made by a researcher and released in the wild so discussion is not going to cause more harm then already known.

<p>Sounds really bad. Looks like gpg upstream fixes didn’t flow into Debian stable security upgrades.</p>
<p>Staying away from key servers until the dust setteld seems the way to go, as per:</p>
