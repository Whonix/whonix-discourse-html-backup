    <title>Kicksecure - Security Focused Linux Distribution based on Debian - In Development - Feedback Wanted!</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kicksecure-security-focused-linux-distribution-based-on-debian-in-development-feedback-wanted/5943</link>
    <description>**scope:**

- will be initially released for VMs (VirtualBox, maybe Qubes, maybe KVM)
- &quot;sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli&quot; will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts, in other words installations of Debian can be easily converted into Kicksecure by installing the kicksecure-cli or other hardened debian package
- maybe later available as ISO for installation on hardware depending on community interest and support

**hardening by default in Kicksecure version 1:**

- install haveged by default for better entropy
- [sdwdate](https://github.com/Whonix/sdwdate) rather than [insecure NTP](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync)
- [security-misc](https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc) (Kernel Self Protection; Enhances Misc Security Settings)
- open-link-confirmation
- enable apparmor by default
- available [apparmor profiles](https://github.com/Whonix?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=apparmor-profile&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language=)
- hopefully [spectre / meltdown](https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-vulerable-due-to-missing-processor-microcode-packages-spectre-meltdown-retpoline-l1-terminal-fault-l1tf) resistant by default
- [SecBrowser ™: A Security-hardened, Non-anonymous Browser](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SecBrowser)
- [grub live boot menu entry](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Grub-live)

**hardening by default in Kicksecure version 2:**

- [better kernel version](https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-versions-and-security)

**usability by default:**

- https://github.com/Whonix/shared-folder-help
- https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc

**desktop environment:**

initially will be available most likely for:
- CLI only (console only, no desktop environment)
- XFCE

**vision:**

- computer security community is larger than computer anonymity community - we can work on a shared interest that is security
- we apply as many security settings by default
- we apply as much as default from [System Hardening Checklist](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/System_Hardening_Checklist)
- Kicksecure will be the base for [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org) (Whonix is applying most of above already anyhow)

**development status:**

- meta package &quot;kicksecure-xfce&quot; and &quot;kicksecure-cli&quot; exist - https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control
- most packages working (since reused from Whonix)
- build script ready (`--flavor kicksecure-xfce` / `--flavor kicksecure-cli`)
- builds successfully
- installation on Debian buster hosts using the `kicksecure-cli` package initially tested by developer, call for wider testing upcoming
- VirtualBox ova downloads upcoming

**initial homepage:**

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure

**About me:**
I am the founder and a maintainer of the Debian Linux and Tor based [Whonix - Anonymous Operating System](https://www.whonix.org).

**Questions:**

Are you interested in Kicksecure? What do you think? What would you like to see? Any suggestions?</description>

    Hi everyone! 
I’m 0brand, 
My project proposal “Document Installation and Setup of the New Security-focused Hardened Debian Linux Distribution” <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/" rel="nofollow noopener">was selected by Whonix</a> for the Season of Docs 2019. The following represents the basic outline of the work I intend to complete between September 2, 2019 - November 29, 2019 which is the Season of Docs documentation development phase. Any feedback (critiques, constructive criticism, ideas etc) would be appreciated.

<p>Hardened Debian would make a great introduction to Linux for Windows users who might want to try Linux out for the first time.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thats just wont happen for new comers to GNU/Linux. its self contradictory statement because Windows is for noobs when they come to Debian needs alot of changes and when there is “Hardened Debian” thats requires even more.</p>
<p>But if hardened debian going to be so idiotic one based on newbies configurations just like Ubuntu then no need the headache , freshly minimized Debian way much better in this case. (and most likely wont be considered hardened anyway…)</p>

            <p>Very true indeed no diluting the hard (pun unintended) earned recogniztion allowed.</p>
<p>There is always that pre-existing notion in many users mind when they encounter the term “hardened” . Clearly the efforts often stray towards the notion with a “kernel” centric focus.</p>

            <p>Hardened Debian would make a great introduction to Linux for Windows users who might want to try Linux out for the first time.  Much of the documentation from the proposed <code>"whonix-can-become-a-distribution-targeting-first-time-linux-users"</code> project could be used for this. Maybe even combine the two projects for maximum usefulness? I think that would be very reasonable with some community contributions.</p>

            <p>Dependencies for individual packages are minimal. Necessary stuff only.<br>
Could you please have a look at some packages and let me know if<br>
dependencies are non-minimal?</p>
<p>Many years ago (maybe up to Whonix 7 or so) there were no separate<br>
packages but only packages like whonix-shared, whonix-gateway and<br>
whonix-workstation with all files but that has long been deprecated in<br>
favor of separate packages.</p>

            <p>Speaking of keeping dependencies down, if you could limit the dependencies to only what is necessary I will help you port the packages to Ubuntu.  I started doing this for Whonix packages a couple years ago but there was enough differences in the Ubuntu/Debian KDE versions and dependancies that it became impossible so I dropped it.   But I think if you stuck to minimal dependancies this will be much easier.</p>
<p>That would open up a whole new user base.</p>
