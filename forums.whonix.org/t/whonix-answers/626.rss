            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>1 )  So  configuring  both Whonix virtual  Machine, I  have to set  ‘‘NAT’’  in the  internet  configuration with the host ?  Or ‘‘Bridge’’ ?</p>
<p>2 )  And  Just another  question: If  I make 2 partitions,  and I have a  virus  in an OS2 of  this  partition,  can  it  compromise the anonimity, even if  I  am  running  another  partition?<br>
For  example if I have  a virus on  Kali Linux  on my  first partition (not  virtual machine)  and  I  run<br>
Fedora  on  a different  partition, can that  virus (on kali)  run as well?</p>

<p>Just the last questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Must I  update everyday my   Warkstation and Gatwey, and  how?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How  must I set  the internet network (NAT,bridge, etc…)  with the host,and  mustI condivide  the periferics with the hosts (mouse, sata, etc etc…)  or not?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How  an adversary could  exploit  my  virtual machine, in your opinion</p>
</li>

            <blockquote>Yes of  coursea  keylogger  could see  everything  I write,  but  only on the  Workstation, not  in  the Host machine, isn't it?</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>It could not see my  Ip,
 or  could  it ?</blockquote>
Only when the adversary found a way to exploit the virtualizer.
<blockquote>because everyone  of us can take  a virus  from  the network (even if in Linux  it's hard)   or can be  ''ratted'' (remot tools installation)  from someone...  so  in these cases, what  happens?</blockquote>
The avast thing:
Yes, if workstation is infected, it can try to attack Whonix-Gateway through the network connection. There is no way to prevent that.
<blockquote>So if  an adversary has good  skills, he  could  do it?</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>Could he  bypass  the  Whonix  Workstation, for example with a Rat?</blockquote>
I prefer calling those torjan horses, that is the usual term.
<blockquote>In witch way?</blockquote>
1) Exploit a vulerablity the virtualizer and break out to the host.
2) Use network, exploit a vulnerability in the gateway ('s linux kernel network...).
<blockquote>And  how it  could  be  prevented? </blockquote>
You can only make it more difficult.
That's what https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Security_Guide is about.
<blockquote>but  you  are telling me  that an adversary  with good skill, could  do it ..so I  am a little  confused...</blockquote>
If you're wondering if there is perfect security, the answer is clearly no.

It could not see my  Ip,<br>
or  could  it ?<br>
Could  it  bypass  the Virtual machine in same  way?</p>
<p>Because in this  Avast forum  I found this:</p>
<p>‘’‘can a virus in an MS Virtual PC machine infect the host PC?’’’’</p>
<p>‘‘If the virtual PC is connected by the (virtual) network with the host PC then it probably can infect it.’’</p>
<p>‘‘Can you ping your host from the virtual system? Can you connect to network shares of your host from the virtual system? If yes, then everything is similar to the situation where there would be two computers on the network, one infected and one yours - if your host system is not patched and not running firewall/antivirus and your virtual PC is running suitable virus, then YES you can be infected IMHO.’’</p>

<p>Can you  explain me Patrick, i’ m  very confused, I  don’t know if it’s  really possible or not…</p>

Not  on the  host or Gatwey workstation vm.<br>
I would be still anonimous, or not?<br>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Conceptually impossible. Higher levels always beat lower levels. The analogy of a weak fundamental applies here.</p>
<p>A virus on the host can in theory replace the whole virtualizer. Rewrite any parts of it. Then you’re not running the virtualizer, but the modified virtualizer.</p>
<p>Viruses is a misleading term. They don’t compare to biological viruses at all. A text editor, a virtualizer, an operating system, also a virus, it’s all just “programs”. It’s all just code running on hardware. From that flows, that hardware has the most power. During run it modify code in RAM. Then different code gets executed. And software has no way to prevent this. A virtualizer is a sandbox made of software. Perhaps visualize such as sandbox as a cage. As long as the cage is stable, software inside the cage cannot do anything outside the cage. But the key to the cage is laying around and cannot be effectively hidden.</p>
<p>A virus on the host on the other hand runs on the same level as the cage. Therefore can modify the cage.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be nice if VMs could be made secure even if the host is infected by a virus, but that’s conceptually impossible. The best concept I am aware of to cope up with that sad reality is something like Qubes. Keeping the host minimal and robust. And then doing various within different VMs that still somehow safely can interact.</p>

            <p>Yes, but  the  guest is  isolated by  the hos…it  is  like  another conntection  i think, because  I  have red  that NO  connection running in the  Work station can go   out  of  the  workstation…so I  assume  that  a  virus  on the host  can not interfere  with  the  workstation virtual machine…otherwise it  doesn’t  make any sense,  the  2  VMs, the Gateway,   and  all the rest… it should be  an ISOLETED sistem  that does  not interferes with  the phisical  host…  but  I  am  not  sayng  you are  wrong, I  am just  telling my  point of wiew, of  how  should  be  the  thing, to be  really  safe…<br>
Let’s  assume for example  that  I  download a  program in the  VM Workstation (not in the host)  ,  and  this program is  a   RAT…  what  happens to my anonimity?<br>
Thank u  for the answers</p>

            <p>Because the host controls everything that runs on the host including the virtualizer. Now when the host is not trusted, we should assume the host also tampered with the virtualizer. And when the virtualizer is not to be trusted, there is nothing Whonix can do within that virtualizer.</p>

I  just would to know things…<br>
If  Whonix  is said to be  an isolating way to connect on internet that has no link with  the phisical machine (the pc), then why if I have many  virus or  rat on it,my anonimity will be compromised?<br>
Just can  u explaine me?<br>
