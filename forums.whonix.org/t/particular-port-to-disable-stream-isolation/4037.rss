    <title>Particular port to disable stream isolation?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/particular-port-to-disable-stream-isolation/4037</link>
    <description>I have a program that makes a lot of connections, which means I don&#39;t want sys-whonix making a new Tor circuit for each one (as they&#39;re all inherently related anyway). What port combined with sys-whonix&#39;s IP can I redirect this program to (in a completely separate VM from whonix) to make sure it just uses one circuit for all of the connections the program makes? Or what other way is there to do it?</description>

            <p>It’s mostly a Tor specific question as per<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a>.</p>
<p>After having the answer on how to configure Tor in such as way, applying<br>
that configuration in Whonix should be the trivial part of it.</p>
