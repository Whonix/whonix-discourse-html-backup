            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>you seem to have a crucial missunderstanding in regard to what an IP is and what an identifier is in this regard.</p>
<p>First of all, when using Whonix in the standard configuration your IP is NEVER exposed inside the Workstation. That’s just by design.</p>
<p>Second: An identifier in this regard means just any way of finding you a second time. In regards to flash, this is somewhat similar of a cookie. With it, a site/server may know when you access a site again true it, however your IP is not exposed. This is pseudononymous. This makes tracking to you/identifying you not possible, though it allows someone to track how often your ID has accessed something.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>

<p>No, it wasn’t. As you wrote yourself, it is pseudononymous because there is no way of finding the true origin/IP. So your IP was never exposed.</p>

<p>I didn’t get it , A pseudonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin (IP/location) of a connection, <strong>but can associate it with an identifier.</strong>   When i was write my ip was exposed, i mean for that association with an identifier .</p>

            <p>Flash / Browser Plugin Security:<br>
Conclusion : IP/location/identity will still be hidden inside Whonix-Workstation. Assume it to be pseudonymous rather than anonymous.<br>
From whonix documentation.</p>
