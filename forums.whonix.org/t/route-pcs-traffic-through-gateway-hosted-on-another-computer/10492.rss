    <description>Hello! Hope you&#39;re doing well. Essentially, so did I, but it was not long before i&#39;ve destroyed my evening trying to solve this, to say mildly, a bit strange task.To begin with, I want to assure those who had already thought of replying to this post with the warning - yes, I do acknowledge all the risk i&#39;m going to introduce into my life, and i am 100% sure that it&#39;s what i want to achieve.

So, these are inputs:

1. An old PC i need to connect to the internet as secure as I can. I&#39;ve already tried Tails and that definitely wouldn&#39;t work here.
2. Right next to it i have my beautiful test setup(linux host + several vm&#39;s, including ready-to-use gateway).

What i did was: installed **whonix-approved** preconfigured debian distributive on PC #1, connected it to an available ethernet port on the PC #2, **checked** that configs `/etc/network/interfaces` and `resolv.conf` were suitable(aka had standart static ip settings that would help it find gateway) and tested two situations.

One, where i didn&#39;t touch host settings at all, connected ethernet adapter straight to gateway(in QEMU-KVM, thats what i use), and, unsurprisingly, result wasn&#39;t wery marvelous - in the end i needed all VM&#39;s to be in a single **internal** network.

And second, where i tried my best to setup bridge connecting ethernet adapter and the exact network i needed - **internal** one - and, as you&#39;ve probably already guessed, at least by me mentioning network&#39;s title one more time, this had also failed.

My question is: what you think would be the most practical way to solve this puzzle, as i would really appreciate using this kind of setup in nearest future. Thank you for time that you&#39;ve spent reading all this, and i would be glad to give any logs/configs that can help you understand my problem.</description>
