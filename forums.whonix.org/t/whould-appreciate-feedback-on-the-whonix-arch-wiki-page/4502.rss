    <title>Whould appreciate feedback on the Whonix Arch Wiki Page</title>

    <description>Hey everyone.  I wrote this page on the Arch Wiki on how to use Arch as a Whonix Workstation: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Whonix

Any feedback I could get on how to improve the setup, make it more robust, secure, etc... would be welcome. Also, I end the article admitting I don’t as yet have a good was to force the workstation and gateway to remain in time sync. Any suggestions there would also be appriciated. 

Thanks everyone for all the good work you do. With any luck such an article might get more Arch users involved in this great project.</description>
