    <title>Unikernel Whonix-gw on Qubes</title>

    <description>Hi, I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place, but here goes:

I&#39;m sure many of you who use Qubes have seen this MirageOS Unikernel firewall:
http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2016/01/01/a-unikernel-rewall-for-qubesos/

It has been working great for me, very quick, very low resource usage, and truly it is more secure, and uses a different codebase. 

I have been wondering, has the Whonix team has thought about the potential for creating a Unikernel-based Whonix-gw for Qubes? The resource savings could be similar to the firewall, and it could wind up being even more secure.

If not, I have also been thinking about starting a crowdfund to make this a reality, but I am not a developer, and I have never done crowdfunding before, so it would probably be a mess.</description>
