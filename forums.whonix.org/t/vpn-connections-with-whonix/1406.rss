    <title>VPN connections with whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/vpn-connections-with-whonix/1406</link>
    <description>Hi, I have read all about using VPNs in whonix, but I have been unable to successfully connect to one.
I have the option of using PPTP,L2TP or IPSEC (not OpenVPN), and I know that all of these may not be possible.
Every time I try to connect to such services the connection breaks, connecting without using whonix works fine.
Anyone care to tell me their experiences about VPNs in whonix?</description>
