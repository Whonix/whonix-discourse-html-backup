    <title>Add nomenclature per version release</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/add-nomenclature-per-version-release/6343</link>
    <description>Now since whonix is shifting to xfce , and whonix does contain X as well i was thinking to add names to whonix big versions releases like 15,16,17...etc. 

and i was think about an anime which is famous and as well containing X in its name , so i came to find [Hunter X Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter_characters)  is great famous anime and as well the name of it is related to Anonymity VS Surveillance (Hide and Hunting). 

so what everyone think about it? 

(e.g Debian names based on [Toy Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Toy_Story_characters) cartoon)</description>
