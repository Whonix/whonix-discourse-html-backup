    <description>Today I installed Visual Studio Code and was facing unmet dependencies.

    sudo dpkg -i code_1.9.1-1486596246_i386.deb 
    Selecting previously unselected package code.
    (Reading database ... 92267 files and directories currently installed.)
    Preparing to unpack code_1.9.1-1486596246_i386.deb ...
    Unpacking code (1.9.1-1486596246) ...
    dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of code:
     code depends on libnss3; however:
      Package libnss3 is not installed.

    dpkg: error processing package code (--install):
     dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
    Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.22-1) ...
    Processing triggers for mime-support (3.58) ...
    Errors were encountered while processing:
     code

First I tried to install libnss3 manually.

    sudo apt-get install libnss3
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    You might want to run &#39;apt-get -f install&#39; to correct these:
    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     libnss3 : Depends: libnspr4 (&gt;= 2:4.12) but it is not going to be installed
    E: Unmet dependencies. Try &#39;apt-get -f install&#39; with no packages (or specify a solution).

So I went with &#39;apt-get -f install&#39;

    sudo apt-get -f install
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree       
    Reading state information... Done
    Correcting dependencies... Done
    The following package was automatically installed and is no longer required:
      rinetd
    Use &#39;apt-get autoremove&#39; to remove it.
    The following extra packages will be installed:
      libnspr4 libnss3
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
      libnspr4 libnss3
    0 upgraded, 2 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    1 not fully installed or removed.
    Need to get 1,344 kB of archives.
    After this operation, 4,300 kB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y

Why is rinetd not longer required? I didn&#39;t uninstall anything. I expect rinetd it to be an important part of Whonix. 

Should I continue with `apt-get autoremove` ?</description>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying.</p>
<p>On another machine that I was using I noticed that I had removed rinetd but I’m happy to hear it hasn’t any effect. From now on I’ll have a closer look what apt-get suggests to remove.</p>
<p>I’ll make sure to send you a tip soon. This projects deserves to be supported, even many “bad guys” might use it for doing fishy stuff.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply. I completed the <code>sudo apt-get -f install</code> with yes as it didn’t uninstall anything. That step was okay, right?</p>
<p>I didn’t run the auto remove command but apt-get update &amp;&amp; dist-upgrade as you suggested,.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Calculating upgrade... The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
  libc-ares2 libv8-3.14.5 rinetd
Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>apt-get install libnspr4</code> tells me that this package is already installed. I don’t know why it says that <code>libc-ares2 libv8-3.14.5 rinetd</code> is no longer required.</p>
<p>Thx</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Please don’t. Rinetd is a part of Stream Isolation and thus very important to the security concept behind Whonix: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation</a></p>
<p>Could you maybe run apt-get update &amp;&amp; dist-upgrade, as well as apt-get install libnspr4?</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
