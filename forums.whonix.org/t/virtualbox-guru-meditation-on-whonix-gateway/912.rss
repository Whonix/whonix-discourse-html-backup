    <title>Virtualbox Guru Meditation on Whonix Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-guru-meditation-on-whonix-gateway/912</link>
    <description>I was using Whonix and noticed that the Gateway was shutdown due to Virtualbox Guru Meditation as I was web surfing. Would my home IP address be exposed as I was using Tor browser with flash in the Workstation with the Gateway not being up and running in this situation?</description>

            <p>I donâ€™t think so. Whonix-Workstation is specifically designed and tested to not be able to establish any connections when Whonix-Gateway is offline.</p>
