    <title>Am I the only one who has a problem with Youtube in Whonix Workstation?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/am-i-the-only-one-who-has-a-problem-with-youtube-in-whonix-workstation/3693</link>
    <description>Can anybody from this community help me with Youtube video? None of the browsers provided support it. It just freezes - no streaming. How come such a trivial thing as Youtube is not supported? I tried all kinds of plugins for Firefox and Chromium that installed - nothing works. 
Does this distro at all support Youtube? Can anybody suggest what to do?</description>
