    <title>Assistance with another error?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/assistance-with-another-error/1519</link>
    <description>Hi again. I&#39;ve encountered a couple more errors and have some more specifics as to how they came about. If you can help it is appreciated.

Whonix is running under Qubes. I start the whonix-gw proxyvm and run whonixcheck, which is fine. After it is all ready I start the whonix-ws appvm and then run whonixcheck there. I get two error boxes. The first is generic but concerning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;WARNING: whonixcheck aborted! (SIGNAL_TYPE: SIGTERM)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Then the next, much longer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;INFO: &lt;snip...&gt;
ERROR: SocksPort Test Result: https://check.torproject.org was not reachable. (curl exit code: [7] - [Failed to connect to host.]) 
You could check, if you can reach https://check.torproject.org via the Tor Browser Bundle. 
ERROR: TransPort Test: Not checking Tor&#39;s TransPort, because SocksPort test failed already. 
ERROR: Stream Isolation Test: Skipped, because SocksPort test failed! Can not test stream isolation. 
INFO: Whonix News Result:
√ Up to date: whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies 2.5-1
√ Up to date: Whonix Build Version: 11.0.0.3.0 
INFO: Debian Package Update Check Result: No updates found via apt-get. 
INFO: Whonix APT Repository: Enabled. When the Whonix team releases JESSIE updates, they will be AUTOMATICALLY installed (when you run apt-get dist-upgrade) along with updated packages from the Debian team. Please read https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust to understand the risk. If you want to change this, use: 
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix Repository 
WARNING: Tor Browser Update Check Result: Installed Tor Browser version: 4.5.3. Latest recommend Tor Browser version(s): 5.5a3 5.5a3 5.0.3 5.0.3. Please run: 
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Tor Browser Updater&lt;/blockquote&gt;

https://check.torproject.org in Tor Browser reports okay. There is no Tor Browser Updater in the menu but within Tor Browser it reports 5.0.3 and up to date.

Can any body shed light on these errors? They seem to be in error. Thank you.</description>

            <p>Great. It seems like none of it is actually a problem. I’ll update if it seems necessary. Thank you.</p>

            <p>The first one can be ignored. Likely a race condition. The manually started one (?) terminated the autostarted but not yet visible. That message will be removed in Whonix 12.</p>
<p>The second one could be a transient network error? I.e. it will not be reproducible next time? Then ignore it.</p>
<p>The Tor Browser update check in whonixcheck is broken, no longer required because Tor Browser has its own updater. Ignore it. It will be removed in Whonix 12.</p>
