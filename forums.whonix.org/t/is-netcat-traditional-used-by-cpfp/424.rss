    <title>Is netcat-traditional used by CPFP?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/is-netcat-traditional-used-by-cpfp/424</link>
    <description>Somewhere I read a post of yours saying CPFP depends on ucspi-tcp [u]and[/u] netcat-traditional. Is this the case? While I&#39;m confident in the security of the former definitely, I am definitely not of the latter&#39;s. Look at the trackrecord: http://www.cvedetails.com/product/4047/Netcat-Netcat.html?vendor_id=2310

If this is indeed the way things are could you have it only depend on ucspi-tcp?</description>

            <p>I see you are reluctant for other reasons, but the security of this code is clear.</p>
<p>You once said that the burden of proof is on those who make a claim and I have made every effort to research this alternative before suggesting it. I have picked the shell with any history of auditing having ever been performed on its code.</p>
<p>Software/package popularity doesn’t mean much. Windows is “popular” but is a security and privacy nightmare.</p>
<p>At the end of the day what matters are the objective facts.</p>

<li>OpenBSD base system does not include mksh.</li>

<p>So I would assume that mksh attracts much less attention by potential people who could be interested to look for vulnerabilities.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>Its a security oriented fork of OpenBSD that shares fixes and code.</li>
<li>From an auditing perspective we are only interested in the mksh code</li>
<li>mksh is the audited oksh with more fixes which were shared back with OpenBSD [1]<br>
4.They are both compatible with each other and with bash, with any specific code dependencies for the latter scanable for.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see there is huge confusion because of the semantics here. A short history of ksh: <span class="bbcode-b">ksh</span> was a proprietary shell in one of the ancient Unixes. At the turn of the millennium it was released under the name: <span class="bbcode-b">pdksh</span> in the public domain. OpenBSD took it over and then it audited six ways from Sunday, cleaned the code up and modernized it then called it <span class="bbcode-b">oksh</span>, MirBSD another security oriented fork took that exact same audited code and further slimmed it down, sharing any code fixes back with OpenBSD and called it <span class="bbcode-b">mksh</span>.</p>
<p>Since its dead in the water, the ‘ksh’ name bandied around, refers only to these fraternal twin open implementations only.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh_old.htm">https://www.mirbsd.org/mksh_old.htm</a></p>
<blockquote>    mksh is a direct descendant from the OpenBSD /bin/ksh and contains all of its bug fixes and enhancements except the “GNU bash-like $PS1” and “POSIX character class support in globbing” changes and the incompatible “ulimit can handle multiple limits in one invocation” difference. Some of the more weird diffs in oksh have not been merged either.</blockquote>

<p>Useful for a positive public opinion because less geeks will badmouth the project which is good for overall project health.</p>
<p>Let’s assume bash implementation is as secure as python implementation (assume by reality, not by public opinion).<br>
Let’s assume python is more secure by public opinion.<br>
Let’s assume we want more coders to make Whonix more secure and more audits.<br>
Then I conclude it’s better to go by the time and go with python if this attracts more geeks rather them categorizing the project as bad and moving along.</p>

            <p>I have already posted it above but here are the sources and quotes reposted. As part of the base system it has been through security auditing by the OpenBSD team. mksh is practically oksh. In the OpenBSD site, they refer to their implementation oksh/mksh simply as ksh.</p>
<blockquote>mksh is supposed to be a superset of oksh (except GNU bash-style PS1, weird POSuX character classes, and an incompatible ulimit builtin change).</blockquote>

<blockquote>    These compilers have not gone through the security audit and do not contain security enhancements like those in the base system ... [b]Unix shells: ksh and csh in the base system[/b]</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html</a></p>
<blockquote>   [b]The packages and ports collection does NOT go through the same thorough security audit that is performed on the OpenBSD base system. [/b]Although we strive to keep the quality of the packages collection high, we just do not have enough human resources to ensure the same level of robustness and security.</blockquote> 
<p>ksh = base system = audited</p>
<p>It has been undergone security auditing no doubt about it.</p>

            <blockquote>Nevertheless, being right in spite of majority opinion isn't worth much. You have to move with the times or the times move you. So at least for getting rid of the discussion and marketing reasons a python rewrite should be done.</blockquote>
<p>Very clear explanation. Really helped when researching what I did below. In terms of high level scripting languages, they all accomplish pretty similar tasks and have similar abilities. It comes down to which one you’re most comfortable with using. Who cares what others think?</p>
<blockquote>So this boils again down to which C code has been more thoroughly audited by C coders. The question to ask for example is, which string parsing code had the better track record in past.</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Note: This is a long post but I tried compressing the information as much as possible please read it all carefully and the references too which contain useful information and support to the statements written.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Trackrecord:</span></p>
<p>Bash<br>
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/bash">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/bash</a>  4 CVEs</p>
<p>Python<br>
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python</a> no CVEs</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Audit History:</span></p>
<p>Extensive research shows that both interpreters were not subject to any security auditing as of yet. CVE numbers alone are a weak indicator of either one’s security.</p>
<p>The two criteria for finding an alternative shell 1) It must have undergone security auditing 2) It must conform to the bash scripting language as close as possible so as to be useful for you.</p>
<p>Luckily I found something that satisfies these conditions, else I wouldn’t be writing this now  <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Replacement:</span><br>
-OpenBSD base system components undergo constant security auditing.<br>
-Their fork is called oksh<br>
-Its successor exists under the MirOS - an OpenBSD based security oriented project that has been around for a decade.<br>
-Their fork is called mksh<br>
-It further cleans up and fixes oksh and improves upon it. Code is shared between both projects.<br>
-mksh exists in Debian repos</p>
<p>-mksh is largely compatible with GNU bash and can serve as a drop in replacement as its a member of the same lineage.<br>
-mksh also supports more functionality than bash<br>
-certain “bashisms” parts of a script that rely solely on bash-specific functionality could be scanned for in an automated way to identify for modification.<br>
-According to mksh manual there is a restricted mode supported that could prove useful if no functionality disabled is needed by us.</p>

            <p>I am not fully convinced that a python rewrite would improve security a lot. I am not saying the bash implementation is safer either.</p>
<p>The critical code here is handling the incoming connections as well as string parsing. Now, it’s clear that python by popular opinion is more hip than bash[+ coreutils] at the moment, but that doesn’t mean majority is right. Majority of mankind believed in past things that are now generally accepted as wrong as well. Basically both, bash and python allow coders to use a few simple lines of commands (connection handling / string parsing) to do stuff that would otherwise be much more complicated in C or asm code.</p>
<p>Have a million bash coders and/or a million python coders doesn’t automatically make either bash or python more secure. In both cases the complexity is reduced by the bash or python interpreter - which are both written in C. So this boils again down to which C code has been more throughly audited by C coders. The question to ask for example is, which string parsing code had the better track record in past.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being right in spite of majority opinion isn’t worth much. You have to move with the times or the times move you. So at least for getting rid of the discussion and marketing reasons a python rewrite should be done.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-February/005048.html" data-bbcode="true">that thread</a> I discovered a few months ago the Tails team planned to implement the filter in python and having it interact with Tor stem which they then backported to wheezy. This has been done as of sometime now. The merits of this is to simplify it and have less code to maintain, possibly making it yet more safer. I know you are not yet familiar with python but the code is already written by them. Might as well use it right?  <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Well, as said, this isn’t all that critical.</p>
<p>First of all, it assumes Whonix-Workstation being compromised. Second, the commands that are send to Tor’s ControlPort, that either nc (or as proposed tcpcat) will get to see are filtered already anyway. And if the filtering mechanism was broken, then Tor could be asked to revel the real external IP address anyway. In such a situation someone could try to exploit also nc and/or Tor for whatever that would be worth in that situation.</p>
<p>What would be more useful would be a rewrite perhaps in python and/or an AppArmor profile. On neither is work being done at the moment. Hopefully some day.</p>

            <p>I did some research on this and maybe the syntax here might be of use:<br>

<p>Its a little tough for me to wrap my head around this but its helpful I assume. If this doesn’t work I’ll accept it. Its a last ditch effort to try and find something that can make this usable for us.</p>
<p>There is a complementary utility called tcprules that stores certain values received by tcpserver and used by tcpcat/tcpclient - in our case that could be the whitelisted commands. pwdgen is a custom service created by a bash script in the link above, ours is CPFP.<br>
tcpclient example:</p>
<p>[code]#!/bin/sh</p>
<h1>pwdgenc</h1>
<h1>tcpclient for pwdgend service</h1>
<h1>===</h1>
<p>exec /usr/local/bin/tcpclient -RHl0 – <br>
“${1:-0}” “${2:-129}” sh -c ‘exec cat &lt;&amp;6 |/usr/local/bin/delcr’[/code]</p>

            <blockquote>Are you still amenable to this suggestion</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>examples on using it?</blockquote>
Examples are appreciated. I need an example on how to use tcpclient bidirectional.
<blockquote>There is no [code]&lt; "$OUT" &gt; "$IN" &amp;[/code]</blockquote>
Well, we need to read from Tor's ControlPort as well as write to Tor's ControlPort. A "file" that is open for both, reading and writing. Since we need to authenticate, we cannot first write, then close. Because if you write and close, authentication is gone and you won't be able to read.
<p>Abstract: If someone manages to send something to Tor’s ControlPort and read its answer using tcpclient / tcpcat, we may be able to re-use that for control-port-filter.</p>

            <p>Are you still amenable to this suggestion but need more information or examples on using it?</p>
<p>AFAIK you need netcat to listen and print a command it receives. Someone posted printing a script with tcpcat that was received by tcpserver <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/248921/serving-http-requests-with-tcpserver">https://superuser.com/questions/248921/serving-http-requests-with-tcpserver</a></p>
<p>There is no <code>&lt; "$OUT" &gt; "$IN" &amp;</code></p>
<p>just <code>tcpcat 127.0.0.1 9051 </code></p>
<p>The link uses <code>tcpcat myserver 9000</code> to print the input</p>

            <p>Some usage examples for tcpcat that may help before trying tcpclient: <a href="http://ports.su/net/tcpcat">http://ports.su/net/tcpcat</a></p>
<p>Here is an example using bash scripts to pass data to a daemon - in this case qmail, through using tcpserver and tcpclient or tcpcat togther. <a href="http://thedjbway.b0llix.net/qmail/qstat.html">http://thedjbway.b0llix.net/qmail/qstat.html</a><br>
The concept should be extendable to our situation I think.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>as a drop in replacement doesn’t work.</p>
<p>So unless someone else or me is getting any inspiration on how to port from nc to tcpcat, the latter is unfortunately not an option.</p>
<p>In meanwhile I guess switching from netcat-traditional to netcat-openbsd should be the second best option?</p>
<blockquote>I don't want feature-rich. This is a sensitive context we are using these tools in. Something with a small code size and coded correctly are my priority here, not bells and whistles.</blockquote>
<p>From feature rich / more code doesn’t necessarily follow more vulnerable. Often if you do not use specific features, the code of that features won’t be in use.</p>
<blockquote>Contrast this with tcpcat's description as simple.</blockquote>
/usr/bin/tcpcat is a shell wrapper using /usr/bin/tcpclient. Did you compare with tcpclient?
<blockquote>Code correctness comes first. Adding an Apparmor profile is beneficial but should not be our first consideration ever when deciding about what to use.</blockquote>
Yes.

            <p>There are better metrics to consider. Who the author is. How many lines of code (use SLOCCount) or descriptions.</p>
<p>Both must be taken into account together for a better decision.</p>
<p>ucspi-tcp is written by Daniel J. Bernstein. Gifted mathematician, cryptographer and computer scientist. Famous for his challenging of the US government ban on exporting strong cryptography, one of the most prominent cypherpunks of our time.  He dedicated his time in writing replacements for insecure unix utilities, making code correctness priority. DJB’s software has impeccable track records in resilience and security. He also works on post-quantum cryptography. <a href="http://pqcrypto.org">pqcrypto.org</a></p>

            <p>/usr/bin/tcpcat is a shell wrapper using /usr/bin/tcpclient.</p>
<p>Got another argument. Comparing which hardening features are using.</p>
<p><code>checksec.sh --file /bin/nc.traditional

<p>vs</p>
<p><code>checksec.sh --file /bin/nc.openbsd

<p>netcat-openbsd shows best results here.</p>
<p>And argument from popularity.</p>
<ul>
<li>0, apparently almost no one is using tcpcat: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=tcpcat">http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=tcpcat</a>
</li>
<li>1000+, many users of netcat: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=netcat">http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=netcat</a>
