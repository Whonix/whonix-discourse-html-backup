    <description>Greten,

I have just learned of whonix.
I have just installed and am now running the duble vm system withing Virtual Box.
I can think it is running correctly for general browsing purposes, because when I use the /check ip/ link in the included TOR browser it gives me a TOR generated IP somewhere else on earth.
What I don&#39;t understand is what the interaction between my workstation and the gateway is. 
I also don&#39;t understand who to ensure I only a particular exit relay or group of exit relays. Or how I can black list certain exit relays in certain countries.  Or how I can even confirm which exit relay I am using.
The reason of confusion is this:
Running tor-arm on the gateway the list of circuits, including all exit relays does not match what my browser in TOR browser on workstation tells me when I /check ip/
When I run tor-arm on workstation, it says not connected to tor at all. 
I am reading and reading about tor and how it works, but I don&#39;t want to do too much until I understand how to ensure my duble vm setup is doing what I want.

Thanken,
slonen</description>

            <p>The same way you would do it with system Tor.<br>
The same way you would do it on Debian jessie with the Tor Debian package.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a>.</p>
<p>By editing /etc/tor/torrc on Whonix-Gateway.</p>
<p>Open torrc:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Open_/etc/tor/torrc" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Open_/etc/tor/torrc</a></p>
<p>Tor manual:<br>
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en</a></p>
<p>From there you can paste the same configuration as if Whonix was not involved.</p>

            <p>Helo,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for the excellent pointers to the right direction. It helped me greatly.  I think I understand about not messing about with the exit relay configurations, but in my situation I only want to prevent 1 or 2 relays and allow the rest.  I live in a rare place, easily identifiable among my circle of associates.  It is at the point, where if I was randomly routed via a relay in my location, (which there are a few) then if my ip were captured and geolocated, then someone in a very small circle of operators would realize who it was.  So what I really want is to specify one or two exit relays to never, ever use just in case it happens randomly.    Unless I am thinking about this the wrong way?</p>
<p>Your information was most helpful, so thanks to you!</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>pretty much all of your questions are answerd here: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About</a> To put it shortly, the Workstation NEVER connects directly with the Tor-network, but only with the Gateway over a local connection on your computer. The Gateway on the other hand only connects with the Tor-network and does nothing else.</p>
<p>Futhermore, please regard this for your exit node questions: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit</a> Simply edit the torrc in your Gateway, according to these settings, to limit the exit nodes, you use. This however is <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span></span></span> recommended and can very drastically limit your security when using Tor, quote:</p>
<blockquote>We recommend you do not use these — they are intended for testing and may disappear in future versions. You get the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit nodes can mess up your anonymity in ways we don't understand.</blockquote>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
