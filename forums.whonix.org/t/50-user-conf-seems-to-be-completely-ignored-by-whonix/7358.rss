    <title>50_user.conf seems to be COMPLETELY ignored by Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/50-user-conf-seems-to-be-completely-ignored-by-whonix/7358</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to have the same exit node for a specific domain and a specific IP address. 
tried &quot;TrackHostExits domain(dot)com&quot; doesn&#39;t work, exit node changes within 10-5 minutes.

tried &quot;TrackHostExits domain(dot)com,1.1.1.1(ip)&quot; and that also didn&#39;t do the trick, to no one&#39;s surprise.

Only conclusion I have arrived at is that the config file is being completely ignored, why? This is beyond me, I re-installed the gateway and still does not work.</description>

            <p>If you’re only interested in a specific domain and you don’t mind selecting the exit node manually, one way would be to use the ExitNodes setting in the file on separate Whonix Gateway / Whonix Workstation that are then used to access only this site.</p>
<p>At any case this setting will make it clear whether the file is ignored or not.</p>

            <p>I was duckducking and googling for 7 hours, opening this thread was a mean of last resort. Checking out the ticket, thanks</p>

</aside>
<p>re-install is mostly a Windows concept. On Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>something broken, don’t know how to diagnose, don’t know how to fix</li>
<li>reinstall Windows</li>
<li>root cause not understood so likelihood of being affected again by some issue is high</li>
</ol>
<p>With Linux distributions we need  re-install a lot less, and we’re much better at diagnosing and fixing bugs, due to Open Source.</p>

</aside>
<p>Using Duckduckgo is a good idea when troubleshooting. For example; searching for key words “Tor TrackHostExits” returns the above answer.</p>
