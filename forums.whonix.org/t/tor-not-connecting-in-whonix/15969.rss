    <title>Tor Not Connecting in Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-not-connecting-in-whonix/15969</link>
    <description>Been having issues connecting to tor. I am newish to qubes whonix and have seen other topics similar but they differed slightly and no troubleshooting has worked thus yet. First day of downloading qubes 4.1 was able to connect to tor for several hours, but since then have not been able connect. When using bridges, tor configuration gets stuck at 2% &quot;Connected to pluggable transport&quot; OR 10% &quot;Connecting to relay&quot;. When they get stuck here, there is no further movement. Seems like 1/10 times tor show connected without bridges, but whonix icon still shows the open lock and tor browser still does not connect. 

sdwdate log viewer shows: 

INFO: Running anondate-get...
______ ### START: ### /usr/sbin/anondate-get
____ INFO: anondate-get returned Tor consensus middle range time or minimum time.
____ INFO: The &#39;anondate-get&#39; time_result is earlier than the current system time, ok. Not setting clock backwards.
____ ### END: ### Exiting with exit_code &#39;3&#39; indicating &#39;Setting time using anondate either not possible or not required.&#39;.

anondate-get in sys-whonix:

is local system time the same as sys-whonix UTC time? Must I adjust time in sys-whonix to match local time?

Now when running systemcheck in sys whonix gui:

systemcheck gave up waiting. 
Tor Circuit: not established 
Connection 10 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=10 TAG=conn_done SUMMARY=&quot;Connected to a relay&quot; WARNING=&quot;TLS_ERROR&quot; REASON=TLS_ERROR COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore HOSTID=&quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&quot; HOSTADDR=&quot;XX.XX.XXX.XX:XXX&quot; 

Though not advised I have manually adjust time in  forward and backwards 2 hours just to see if anything would change but no changes.

Thanks in advance to this helpful community if anyone is able to assist in troubleshooting. Learning qubes daily and the fact of this obstacle with tor puts a damper on it.

edit: am able to connect through debian 11/fedora 36 browser, just not through tor. since updates were configured over tor I cannot update to see if, because no tor connection.</description>

I have installed TBB in my debian-11 template and have been sucessfully using tor via that. But still the same issue persists within whonix. is it still assumed that it is not a whonix related issue? Or is tor actually overloaded</p>
<p>I have tried multiple fresh qubes installs, have tried various internet connections in various locations, different ISP’s, different type of routers, devices, public/private connections… now getting errors such as:</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>currently downloading TBB, but i’ll ask a newcomer question, so I downloaded and extracted TorBrowser in a Debian 11 appvm then moved the “tor-browser-linux64-11.5.7_en-US” to debian-11 template. I have reviewed the installing software section and I am not familiar with how to track down where in the debian-11 template this file went. I also don’t know the language enough to launch the tbb from that location.</p>
<p>I have also tried qvm-sync-appmenus start-tor-browser.desktop and have restarted the debian appvm where tbb downloaded and the template and still can’t see the application in qube settings.</p>
<p>I’m sure I missed a step and appreciate any assistance and thank you.</p>

            <p>Been having issues connecting to tor. I am newish to qubes whonix and have seen other topics similar but they differed slightly and no troubleshooting has worked thus yet. First day of downloading qubes 4.1 was able to connect to tor for several hours, but since then have not been able connect. When using bridges, tor configuration gets stuck at 2% “Connected to pluggable transport” OR 10% “Connecting to relay”. When they get stuck here, there is no further movement. Seems like 1/10 times tor show connected without bridges, but whonix icon still shows the open lock and tor browser still does not connect.</p>
<p>sdwdate log viewer shows:</p>

<p>is local system time the same as sys-whonix UTC time? Must I adjust time in sys-whonix to match local time?</p>
<p>Now when running systemcheck in sys whonix gui:</p>
<p>systemcheck gave up waiting.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Connection 10 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=10 TAG=conn_done SUMMARY=“Connected to a relay” WARNING=“TLS_ERROR” REASON=TLS_ERROR COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore HOSTID=“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” HOSTADDR=“XX.XX.XXX.XX:XXX”</p>
<p>Though not advised I have manually adjust time in  forward and backwards 2 hours just to see if anything would change but no changes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to this helpful community if anyone is able to assist in troubleshooting. Learning qubes daily and the fact of this obstacle with tor puts a damper on it.</p>
<p>edit: am able to connect through debian 11/fedora 36 browser, just not through tor. since updates were configured over tor I cannot update to see if, because no tor connection.</p>
