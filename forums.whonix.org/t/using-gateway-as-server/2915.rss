    <title>Using Gateway as server?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-gateway-as-server/2915</link>
    <description>Is it okay to use the whonix gateway to host an onion? 

And simply point the hidden service to a debian workstation like &quot;10.152.152.17 12345&quot;? Generally it seems best not to modify any of the whonix preconfigured settings. So I&#39;m not sure if using the gateway to host a web server is good or bad for security. For example, if the web server in the debian workstation gets compromised, is it better that I&#39;m using whonix or would that make it easier for an attacker to pivot through my network? Or does it not make a difference at all?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I’m not really sure what you are asking as the question is a bit unspecific, though if you just want to host a hidden webserver using Whonix, this should clear up most questions: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hidden_Services</a> Also, due to the isolated nature of Whonix from its host, using it to provide a hidden service is always safer than doing it on the host, as it makes compromising the entire system and/or network harder.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
