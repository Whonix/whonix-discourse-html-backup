    <title>Moving files between gateway and workstation and vice versa</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/moving-files-between-gateway-and-workstation-and-vice-versa/3780</link>
    <description>Hi, is it possible to move my tor data folder  to my workstation so I can then email it to another workstation on a complete separate server. Once I have tor data folder on the new workstation I will then need to move it back to that workstations gateway.

My aim is to use a hidden service address I have on my old server on my new server. Can I do this? I am using KVM.</description>

            <p>Easy. Add the same shared folder to both the workstation and gateway VMs and transfer files across it.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t forget to encrypt the contents of course.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid identity linking use a dedicated email address to send and open the contents on your other server.</p>
