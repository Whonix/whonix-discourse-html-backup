&gt; Hosting a Tor relay and/or bridge and using it to mix one&#39;s own traffic might be beneficial for anonymity. Advanced users only! Please refer to the write-ups by The Tor Project, the developers of the Tor software.
&gt; 
&gt; Quote The Tor Project [New low cost traffic analysis attacks and mitigations](https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations) [[archive]](https://web.archive.org/web/https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations):
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; In terms of mitigating the use of these vectors in attacks against Tor, here&#39;s our recommendations for various groups in our community:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Users: Do multiple things at once with your Tor client
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Because Tor uses encrypted TLS connections to carry multiple circuits, an adversary that externally observes Tor client traffic to a Tor Guard node will have a significantly harder time performing classification if that Tor client is doing multiple things at the same time. This was studied in [section 6.3 of this paper](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2015/cacr2015-09.pdf) [[archive]](https://web.archive.org/web/http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2015/cacr2015-09.pdf) by Tao Wang and Ian Goldberg. A similar argument can be made for mixing your client traffic with your own Tor Relay or Tor Bridge that you run, but that is [very tricky to do correctly](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service) [[archive]](https://web.archive.org/web/https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service) for it to actually help.

Was there in past some research statement or argument that hosting a Tor relay or bridge and at the same time use it for oneself being actually harmful to one&#39;s anonymity?</description>

<p>I think this was covered on the wiki at some point when discussing web fingerprinting. It’s not trivial to do but should help protect you against end-to-end. On the other hand it becomes more noticeable when the relay goes offline which aids other attacks.</p>
