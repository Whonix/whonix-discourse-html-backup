    <title>Secure, Distribiuted TimeSync on the Host, any Host, not just Whonix</title>

    <description>Even if we had a Whonix host additions (https://phabricator.whonix.org/T21) package, it would still be unclear on how to securely sync the time on the host. Conceptually unclear.

Running sdwdate, distributed fetching time from Tor hidden services isn&#39;t possible for users in censored areas. They might even want to avoid connecting to the Tor public network.

Trying to find a solution here that works for any host. Not just for Whonix, Tor users.

Any &quot;check if connecting to the public Tor network is okay for you or dangerous, even though you might not care about Tor&quot; + &quot;oh well, there are also all sorts of bridges stuff&quot; seems awful.

            <p>Yes all good ideas for triggering. The Tor one might be the easier to write for but they all make sense especially for distro integration choices.</p>

<p>Yes it should be its own project but the question is how will it know that the system time is wrong to begin with to warrant prompting the user for a manual adjustment?</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe it should not run on it’s own. Only started by triggers. Using .d-style drop-in files. When? Distributions decide. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>after installation, at first boot</li>
<li>when Tor fails for time syncing related reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think this is really a big problem because time is set during system install and the hardware clock has its own battery to keep the time persistent across reboots.</p>

            <p>We want a reasonable correct time on the host so or so. It’s important for (package upgrade) verification purposes. And a secure way to obtain the time. Whonix/Tor/anonymity is not the main reason for this.</p>
<p>This most likely doesn’t belong into sdwdate, which is a (terminal-only) daemon, which in essence fetches time from Tor hidden services. Having sdwdate include a gui tool to ask the time would be awful. Maybe using a plugin that calls a separate project, but probably not. As said above, sdwdate on the host is problematic, because not everyone can/wants/should use it.</p>
<p>Any ‘Ask the user what time it is’ [on the host] solution, if that’s any good/useful one, would be a separate project.</p>

            <p>I think that’s really a Tor problem and how well it handles initial connection decisions with the Tor-launcher wizard. sdwdate shouldn’t have to ask these questions.</p>
