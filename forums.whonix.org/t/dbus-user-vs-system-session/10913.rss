    <title>dbus - user vs system session</title>

    <description>    systemctl status dbus

vs

    systemctl --user status dbus

Which one is better? Or which one is less of an issue? Any difference?

Intuition would tell that a systemd user service with dbus is slightly less worse than a systemd system services with dbus. However, auote https://packages.debian.org/buster/dbus-user-session:

&gt;  D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications. Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of complexity.
&gt; 
&gt; On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which a user&#39;s session starts the first time they log in, and does not end until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up to one graphical session, into a single &quot;user-session&quot; or &quot;super-session&quot; within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
&gt; 
&gt; Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing graphical session and unlocking it.
&gt; 
&gt; To retain dbus&#39; traditional session semantics, in which login sessions are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install dbus-x11 instead.
&gt; 
&gt; See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general. 

Would it be good of bad to have package dbus-user-session installed?

Background why I stumbled on this: got an [issue](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5247#issuecomment-751645892) while working on [constrained system resources program starter wrapper](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16180) as workaround to [applications using too much system resources freezing the whole system](https://forums.whonix.org/t/why-has-whonix-become-unusable/10907).

<p>I think --user is a de-privileged way to interact with dbus which is better for security, but you can run into problems with XDG RUNTIME</p>
