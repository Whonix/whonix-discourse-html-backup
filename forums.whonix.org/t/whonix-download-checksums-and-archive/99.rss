    <description>Dear Patrick,

Could we get some checksums published for the Whonix download files (both vm images &amp; signatures)?

Like sha256 or above checksums.

Maybe published in the Whonix blog release announcements and/or Whonix download page.

Yes, I know signatures are better, but checksums would just help at times with the workflow of verifying that I at least got the files downloaded fully (downloads often fail over tor) and that I&#39;m using the same unmodified original source files later on with re-installs, etc.

Fast and easy to do (built into Linux command line) when publishing new downloads, so I thought I&#39;d request it.

Thank you, Patrick.

            <p>Dear Patrick,</p>
<p>I agree that unaffiliated personal copies of Whonix’s history are semi-important, which I personally do as well. However, having official original sources of information be archived by trustworthy public archiving systems, like <a href="http://Archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org</a>, is most important for establishing a better historical chain of public integrity and trust. Since, any private archive of Whonix information/files/source/etc could be modified by the private archiver.</p>
<p>I did some deeper checking throughout the Whonix website.</p>
<p>Things look pretty good since we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GPG Signing Key on an HTML/TXT archivable page:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPG Signatures on an HTML/TXT archivable page:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/download/current/7-sig/Whonix-Gateway-7.ova.asc" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/download/current/7-sig/Whonix-Gateway-7.ova.asc</a><br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/download/current/7-sig/Whonix-Workstation-7.ova.asc" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/download/current/7-sig/Whonix-Workstation-7.ova.asc</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Source Code files on HTML/TXT archivable pages:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verifiable Builds of binary images from the source code:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifiable_Builds</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are a couple issues that I’d note.</p>
<p>The Verifiable Builds page says:</p>
<p>“When building Whonix .ova’s from source code, for example /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-7.ova also report /home/user/whonix_binary/Whonix-Gateway-7.report file will be created.”</p>

            <p>Thank you for caring about this.</p>
<p>For history analysis, wouldn’t the gpg be signatures enough?</p>
<p>Adding the checksums to a blog post makes the blog post unnecessarily bigger. Adding them to a wiki page would be another step, a burden, that has to be done every release. I need to keep the burden (anti motivation to make releases) low and need really good reasons for doing this extra work. In any case, if there is a volunteer who copies the contents of the checksums file to their own wiki page(s), I am fine with that.</p>
<p>Unless there is a really good reason, most times it’s best to stick with proven secure ways of doing things. Are there any other security focused projects, that publish checksums in a blog post or archive them on a website?</p>
<p>Also history analysis is difficult with images that size. Sourceforge never complained yet about traffic or file sizes, but non-important releases such as the testers-only releases and old releases get purged and sourceforge prefers this. I don’t want to push it. <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a>’s download mirrors also prefer not carrying obsolete releases around.</p>
<p>Each and every little change to Whonix’s source code is being recorded in Whonix’s git repository going back to TorBOX (old project name) 0.1.3. Releases are git tagged. Git tags are gpg signed as well. Once someone cloned Whonix’s git repository, all old tags will remain unchanged forever (unless deliberately deleting them oneself). It’s not within Whonix git administrators power to delete git tags someone already downloaded by changing the git repository. (That’s how git works by default.) And one can stay up to date by running “git fetch” every now and then. Since keeping history (and auditing) is better done by someone who isn’t affiliated with the project, I don’t think there is anything I could do about it. You’re encouraged to keep all versions of Whonix’s source code. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Contribute#Backup_Whonix">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Contribute#Backup_Whonix</a>)</p>

            <p>Thanks Patrick. That works well.</p>
<p>Although, it would also be great if these checksums were published on a Whonix webpage or blog post.</p>
<p>The reason is that an official public historical record of these checksums could then be established by third party web archiving sites (like <a href="http://Archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org</a>, etc).</p>
<p>Then, for future integrity/security audits from the public, it would be a simple way to help establish that much more public trust, to verify that the source Whonix files aren’t being tampered with over time (either internally by you, or externally via third parties, or by bit rot data corruption, etc).</p>
<p>So publishing the checksums publicly on a Whonix HTML webpage would be the only other recommendation I’d have, so they could be publicly archived for any historical analysis in the future (like how the TrueCrypt project is being audited right now).</p>
<p>Thanks again, Patrick.</p>
