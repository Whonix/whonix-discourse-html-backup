    <description>As per these two subjects:

Let&#39;s say the Whonix-Host would be fully torified and the user using private (non-published), obfuscated bridges. That would still looks suspicious to an ISP since it lacks the usual Windows desktop operating system update and other phone home traffic. Would still be an &quot;[extremist](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nsa-linux-journal-extremist-forum-and-its-readers-get-flagged-extra-surveillance)&quot; non-mainstream operating system user.</description>

            <p>I have read on this site that “hiding TOR/whonix is difficult beyond practicality”, Is that really true? aren’t pluggable transports meant to hide the fact that you are using TOR in countries where it is illegal? I even remember something about some pluggable transports that disguises your traffic as a"normal" traffic to some website.<br>
Can the government/ISP see all the TOR users all the time?</p>

<p>Blocking vs non-blocking is besides the point since that is<br>
circumvention. “circumvention” meaning “just make it work, it’s ok if<br>
someone finds out I used Tor later”. That use case is much easier to<br>
keep supporting.</p>
<p>This is about hiding Tor, i.e. “make it work and make sure no one will<br>
ever find out I used Tor”. Due to very realistic assumptions such as<br>
extended logging of traffic, progress in pluggable transport detection<br>
and retroactive policing it is a very bad idea to try to circumvent Tor<br>
which may even be possible at the time when later (lets say weeks,<br>
months or years) detection is still a personal risk.</p>

    The ability to install Whonix meta-packages packages from a repository is currently under heavy development and almost finished. With this announcement we ask that you consider donating to sustain and accelerate progress. 
How it Works: 
In two steps a user is able to convert plain Debian VMs into Whonix: 


First by adding the Whonix repo URLs to the apt sources list (optionally: check instructions for anonymous repo downloads) 


Then doing ‘sudo apt-get install whonix-(gateway|workstation)’

    Actually does Whonix host have to include whonix apt sources? 
Why not include the relevant Whonix packages in Debian servers, as done with all the other packages? 
Advantages: 

No obvious connection to Whonix servers (if updating with clearnet, or visible to exit node if going through Tor).
Not relying on the security level of whonix servers (secured to the same level as debian servers?)

<p>But even if we had that, when even readers of linuxjournal are already<br>
called extremists in the West with relatively many Linux users…</p>

<p>…you can imagine how much users of Linux stand out in countries where<br>
use of Tor is not only blocked but deemed dangerous.</p>
<p>Solution? [1] Debian or any Linux going mainstream on the desktop and<br>
[2] producing lots of Tor traffic by default. I see neither [1] nor [2]<br>
coming.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Whonix uses the same Tor Browser profile as Tor Browser, in other words<br>
unmodified. What Tails is doing is up to Tails. They’ve been criticized<br>
for their custom profile by others. Arguments were made. I don’t think I<br>
could talk them out of it.</p>
<p>However, Tor Browser fingerprint matters at the end of the connection,<br>
i.e. at the destination server. ISPs won’t be able to differentiate<br>
Whonix, Tails, Tor Browser at the ISP level (unless something is very<br>
wrong).</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I understand, this seems technically rather challenging as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of installed packages will unmistakably reveal he is a Whonix user</li>
<li>Fetching Whonix repositories when updating will unmistakably reveal he is a Whonix user</li>
<li>Disabling updates for Whonix packages is bad for security</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the only thing which immediately identifies the user as a Whonix (not only Linux/Debian) user is the Whonix repositories/list of installed packages, then it’s just a question of not updating the machine on an untrusted network, right?<br>
So this eventually boils down to the user choice and wisdom, i.e. a simple warning could be added in the documentation/displayed when running apt update <code>(warning: updating your system may reveal that you are a Whonix user</code>, or something like that), then no need to change the code or disabling Whonix packages…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There could be other things we are not aware of. For example:</p>
<p>[1] The specific package selection by Whonix may result in a specific<br>
set of (font) packages which pulls packages different from a standard<br>
Debian installation. These might then leave a specific network<br>
fingerprint (though <code>website fingerprinting</code> [something that happens at<br>
ISP <em>or</em> Tor exit relay level]).</p>
<p>[2] One package that influences how traffic is shaped is openssl. There<br>
are a ton of other libraries that influence things. Whonix-Host would be<br>
released at a specific time (impossible to sync this with Debian<br>
exactly), therefore a new installation would have very specific package<br>
versions installed. A selection of package versions unique to that<br>
release version of Whonix. The specific selection of packages with their<br>
versions might make the traffic look unique.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Regarding Tor services and connections, I still believe Tor should not be enabled by default, but only upon user’s consent, for instance on first boot with <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard</a> as was suggested above. It can always be activated later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In such a configuration, unnecessary Whonix services that may run automatically and connect to Tor (thinking about sdwdate, Whonix Check, other stuff?) would be deactivated if the user opts out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sdwdate would wait indefinite and do nothing. If Tor doesn’t connect,<br>
any applications configured to use Tor cannot connect. whonixcheck on<br>
Whonix-Host probably doesn’t autorun and run torified (or any)<br>
connections, perhaps update check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds ok in theory but looks still beyond practicality due to [1] and [2].</p>
<p>My conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiding Whonix from ISP level observer seems futile.</li>
<li>Hiding Tor from ISP level observer seems futile too.</li>
<li>The Tor Project researched and developed Tor, an anonymizer. There is<br>
research and implementation for that. Censorship circumvention was an<br>
afterthought.</li>
<li>Hiding a Linux distribution or Tor from ISP level observers is neither<br>
researched, nor implemented anywhere.</li>
<li>Censorship circumvention is something that a small fraction users is<br>
capable of on a trial and error basis “make it work somehow”.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following quote totally destroys it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using private and obfuscated bridges alone does not provide strong<br>
guarantees of hiding Tor use from the ISP. As Jacob Appelbaum has noted:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Some pluggable transports may seek to obfuscate traffic or to morph<br>
it. However, they do not claim to hide that you are using Tor in all<br>
cases but rather in very specific cases. An example threat model<br>
includes a DPI device with limited time to make a classification choice</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>so the hiding is very specific to functionality and generally does not<br>
take into account endless data retention with retroactive policing.</li>
</ul>

be updated with the information gathered here.</p>
<p>Hiding might be something that someone could try on a best effort basis<br>
but nothing to be relied on. It might even work for some users for some<br>
amount of time. Such as these visiting WiFi hotspots which are somehow<br>
magically not surveilled, then move on, however beyond practicality<br>
since endless data retention, with retroactive analysis and retroactive<br>
policing is a threat model most users (such as those often using from<br>
personal name registered ISP) are vulnerable to.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just to keep focus, I thought it might be useful to sum up what’s being discussed here. Probably some redundant stuff, but it’s easy to lose focus when there are so many parameters involved. Please let me know if I forgot something.</p>
<p>So we are discussing whether the Whonix Host/Desktop currently in development (temporary name, see here for more details about the project: <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-host-operating-system/3931/79" class="inline-onebox">Whonix host operating system</a>) should be shipped with default Whonix/Tor settings or not.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Whonix Host/Dekstop project currently aims at providing the following features:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A fully functioning XFCE Desktop based on Hardened Debian (also temporary name), basically a Debian stable derivative with various enhanced security settings (see <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/hardened-debian-security-focused-linux-distribution-based-on-debian-in-development-feedback-wanted/5943" class="inline-onebox">Hardened Debian - Security Focused Linux Distribution based on Debian - In Development - Feedback Wanted!</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shipped as a  live bootable BIOS/UEFI ISO file with preconfigured Whonix-Gateway/Workstation VMs running on KVm for amnesic use and the Calamares Installer to install the whole system on hardware (see <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-desktop-installer-with-calamares-field-report/7350/" class="inline-onebox">Whonix Desktop Installer with Calamares - field report</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The reasoning behind removing all Tor/Whonix-related stuff on the Whonix Host/Dekstop is that the end user may want to benefit from the various security enhancements we ship with this derivative without actually starting up Tor services/being identified as a Whonix user, which in certain instances could even hurt him.</p>
<p>If he wants to use Tor and Whonix, he would instead use the preconfigured Whonix VM that work out of the box, both from the live iso and from the installed system.</p>
<p>As far as I understand, this seems technically rather challenging as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list of installed packages will unmistakably reveal he is a Whonix user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fetching Whonix repositories when updating will unmistakably reveal he is a Whonix user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disabling updates for Whonix packages is bad for security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some security settings related to the Hardened Debian project are probably another fingerprinting measure tying the machine to Whonix (but also probably harder to detect)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My proposal:</strong></p>
<p>Why don’t we try to find some kind of reasonable middle ground:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let’s not try to be “smarter than Tor” to quote <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>, hiding the fact that we are a Linux/Debian derivative, faking Windows network pattern is probably overkill right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the only thing which immediately identifies the user as a Whonix (not only Linux/Debian) user is the Whonix repositories/list of installed packages, then it’s just a question of not updating the machine on an untrusted network, right? So this eventually boils down to the user choice and wisdom, i.e. a simple warning could be added in the documentation/displayed when running apt update <code>(warning: updating your system may reveal that you are a Whonix user</code>, or something like that), then no need to change the code or disabling Whonix packages…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding Tor services and connections, I still believe Tor should not be enabled by default, but only upon user’s consent, for instance on first boot with <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard</a> as was suggested above. It can always be activated later. In such a configuration, unnecessary Whonix services that may run automatically and connect to Tor (thinking about swdate, Whonix Check, other stuff?) would be deactivated if the user opts out.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>I unfortunately agree with sheep. Faking having a Windows network<br>
fingerprint and having an ISP level watcher believe it infeasible.</p>
<p>That’s like a wholly different project. We don’t have anyone before us<br>
attempting to make a Linux desktop computer looks like a Windows desktop<br>
computer from network fingerprint perspective. We’d have to analyze and<br>
compare the traffic. Sounds like a good task for a research paper.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if researchers even where to find ways to<br>
determine a Windows running from a VM (and nothing else on host) vs a<br>
Windows running on a host looking different from a network fingerprint<br>

<p>That would lead us into “Whonix modified Tor” territory, Whonix project<br>
trying to be more clever than The Tor Project as far as the Tor routing<br>
algorithm is concerned.</p>

<p>This being opt-in (or separate build), patches might be acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add random traffic at boot to make it look like Windows. Maybe even ping Microsoft’s domains.</li>
</ol>

<p>I doubt that would go far. To look like Windows traffic the only<br>
reliable way is most likely using real Windows to generate that traffic.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve made a quick draft of some things and adversary could do.</p>
<p>Identify a Whonix/Tor user even with bridges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Network hardening - security misc - not necessarily linked to Whonix but puts user into another subset.</li>
<li>List of installed packages - torifying apt would help this.</li>
<li>Adversary can send packages to user’s machine. Whonix firewall will drop invalid packages. Analyse dropped vs non-dropped packages.</li>
<li>Lots of traffic going to one IP - suspicious - stream isolation helps.</li>
<li>Lots of traffic going to one IP daily - may be a hint to guard nodes.</li>
<li>Using Linux - puts user into another subset.</li>
</ol>
<p>Identify Linux user:</p>
<ol>
<li>TCP/IP fingerprint.</li>
<li>No Windows phone home traffic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Boot options/build options to change settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable network hardening.</li>
<li>Make sure apt is torified - Whonix Host needs this - Whonix VMs torify by default with stream isolation.</li>
<li>Mix up guard nodes. Don’t connect to same one for long periods of time. Maybe even switch during a session.</li>
<li>Add random traffic at boot to make it look like Windows. Maybe even ping Microsoft’s domains.</li>
<li>Tor should prevent site from seeing TCP/IP fingerprint. They should see the exit node’s fingerprint. If not using Tor then a kernel patch is needed <a href="https://nmap.org/misc/defeat-nmap-osdetect.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://nmap.org/misc/defeat-nmap-osdetect.html</a>.</li>

<p>A lot of network traffic going to just one IP address may also be suspicious but stream isolation will solve this for the most part.</p>

<p>Let’s say the Whonix-Host would be fully torified and the user using private (non-published), obfuscated bridges. That would still looks suspicious to an ISP since it lacks the usual Windows desktop operating system update and other phone home traffic.
