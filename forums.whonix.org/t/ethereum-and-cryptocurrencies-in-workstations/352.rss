    <description>I tried to install the go-ethereum in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit running behind the Whonix gateway. It failed but before I go into details I will ask if anyone has got ethereum running behind Whonix. I choose this OS because the go ethereum install script is the easiest without any apparent downloads over non-secured connections.

Now that I have to diagnose a problem with it I&#39;m open to suggestions for using a different OS, ethereum version, or installation method. Open Transactions should be easier but I thought I would mention that I would like a system that can run it as well as other cryptocurrencies. Novacoin is another that doesn&#39;t run on many OSs but it ran on Ubuntu 12. I&#39;d also like to install the Electrum and Armory Bitcoin clients. Ethereum is the only essential one right now, however.</description>
