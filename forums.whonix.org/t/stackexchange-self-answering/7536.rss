    <description>check.torproject.org still works a lot of the time so it can still be good for checking. It&#39;s never given me a false positive before. 

I find it weird that [Roger Dingledine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Dingledine) made that post.</description>

<p>Many people think only criminals use Tor. For example ransomware. This would be a good link to give to people who think that way. So Roger asked this question knowing he was going to answer it <strong>IMO</strong>. Maybe just trying to get out in front of this issue?</p>

<p>Also, perhaps TPO uses this page so others will find these answers on google or perhaps even their support desk (still existing) refers to it?</p>
<p>Because otherwise also this question would seem strange if asked by him.</p>
