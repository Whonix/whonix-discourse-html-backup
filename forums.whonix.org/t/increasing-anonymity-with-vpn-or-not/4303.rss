    <title>Increasing anonymity with VPN? Or not?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/increasing-anonymity-with-vpn-or-not/4303</link>
    <description>I already read Manual about VPN and I understand basics. VPN-&gt;TOR (anonymous from ISP) TOR-&gt;VPN (anonymous from the internet).

I&#39;m not really trying to hide from anybody specific. My ISP is not after me. Internet is not looking for me. I just want more anonymity on the internet. What would you choose? VPN-&gt;TOR or TOR-&gt;VPN. And will it really help increase anonymity while using Whonix? Let&#39;s consider, that I will pay in Bitcoin for VPN. I will not tell my real name to VPN provider.

**(+)** I see VPN as an extra part in the network between me and the internet, that has to be broken. So added anonymity.
**(-)** VPN is static part of network (all my connections are going everytime through this point). Does it decrease my anonymity?

Let&#39;s say I&#39;m Snowden. Would I use VPN? Would I use it before TOR? Would I use it after TOR?</description>

<p>You know they are not logging users activity, how? Do you know the providers personally? This is just an empty promise in an attempt to encourage users to sign up.</p>
<p>BTW</p>
<p>VPNs are <strong>not</strong> anonymous so how can your VPN provider make that claim?</p>

</aside>
<p>There is something I failed to mention. You have to make sure you install the security patches when they become available. This applies to you host ( Xubuntu ) as well as Whonix gateway and workstation.   Although malicious code would not be persistent it could be a problem for your current session.</p>
<p>I understand this could be time consuming but it is very important.</p>

            <p>0brand, thank you for very detailed answers!</p>
<p>I decided against VPN. As there seems to be anonymity risks. Especially when configured by inexperienced user like me.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your time and shared expertise. I really appreciate time you put into writing these excellent answers.</p>

<p>I’m not going to use Ethereum or any other software, that requires VPN.</p>

</aside>
<p>When i mentioned Ethereum I am referring to:</p>
<pre><code>User-&gt;Tor-&gt;VPN-&gt;Internet
</code></pre>
<p>There are use cases other Ethereum for chaining a VPN after Tor. For instance some web sites block Tor users. A workaround would be to use the above chain. All I am saying is this is an option that you could use but you need to make sure you do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use anonymous email if your provider requires a email address for registration.</li>
<li>Use the email address for this specific VPN registration and nothing else</li>
<li>Use a pseudonymous payment method. <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Money">https://whonix.org/wiki/Money</a>
</li>
<li>Use Tor when signing up for VPN</li>
<li>Use this VPN in this chain configuration only. Do not use these VPN credentials for <code>User-&gt;VPN-&gt;Tor-&gt;Internet</code>. If you do your VPN service provider will know the ip address from where your client connected from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things you need to keep in mind if you do choose to use a VPN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your VPN service provider can see your clearnet traffic regardless of how you chain them. [1] <em>See below for exception</em>
</li>
<li>Your VPN service provider can see the ip address from which your client is logged in from if using: <code>User-&gt;VPN-&gt;Tor-&gt;Internet</code>
</li>

<p>I’m not an expert but I know Ubuntu is not known for respecting users privacy. I don’t know if it would really matter since your using a live version.</p>
<p>Your setup sound OK to me. As long as you use Whonix I think you will be alright. The best advice I could give you would be to read through the <strong>entire</strong> Whonix documentation. There is a lot of information on anonymity in there.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unfortunately it just takes time.There a lot of documentation (and forum threads). The way I learn is by reading the documentation and going through and reading the different threads on the Forum. A lot of the discussions on the forums tie in together. You have to learn about many different thing to really understand what you should and shouldn’t do ( for  anonymity ).</p>
<p>Also remember that most of the info I’m giving you comes from memory. That info is scattered throughout the docs and forum threads. I try to add links when I can but I don’t always have the time or can’t recall the exact page I’m quoting info from.</p>

<p>Only he can answer that.

VPN-&gt;TOR or TOR-&gt;VPN. And will it really help increase anonymity while using Whonix? Let’s consider, that I will pay in Bitcoin for VPN. I will not tell my real name to VPN provider.</p>
<p><strong>(+)</strong> I see VPN as an extra part in the network between me and the internet, that has to be broken. So added anonymity.<br>
<strong>(-)</strong> VPN is static part of network (all my connections are going everytime through this point). Does it decrease my anonymity?</p>
<p>Let’s say I’m Snowden. Would I use VPN? Would I use it before TOR? Would I use it after TOR?</p>
