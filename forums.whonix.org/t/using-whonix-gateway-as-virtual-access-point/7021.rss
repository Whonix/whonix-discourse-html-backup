    <title>Using whonix gateway as virtual access point</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-whonix-gateway-as-virtual-access-point/7021</link>
    <description>Hi. After getting the physical gateway to work I would like to do some tweaks and use it as access point.That way people could connect to it through wlan and access tor.

What pitfalls do I have to expect? Are there any infos available about setting up the gateway as virtual access point? What tweaks will it need?

Would it be better to setup the access point on the gateway or use another box/router to handle it?</description>

            <p>I would like to to use it as an access point. So I was wondering do we need to create a third network card in the gateway to link to to the host ? But then what rules should we apply in the firewall ? Make a copy of the whonix internal network firewall rules for example in virtualbox ?</p>
