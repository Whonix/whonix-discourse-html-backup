    <description>torbrowser being an older than current version of firefox, its sync mechanism is incompatible with firefox&#39;s current sync service.

Is there a free/FOSS compatible sync service for current torbrowser out there?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>without wanting to offend you, I feel like your last post is far less informed, then you might think. So, let me explain, why what you’ve written does not only just barely make sense but is actually not something which could in any way shape or form be seen as correct, especially with your focus on “not being to broad” with what gets written, since, as I’ll try to show you, in that area, you’ve been rather hypocritical.</p>
<p>So, let’s start:</p>
<p>[quote=“rAntOCauDgb, post:16, topic:1763”]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“will break this anonymity”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Far too broad. Reduce it, sure, break it - unlikely. The size of the haystack is smaller, but the question is, is it smaller enough to matter, to one, in their use case? [/quote]</p>
<p>First of all, who are you talking about when saying “their use case”? Since you apparently want me to focus on staying absolutely objective, it would be nice if you could not just talk about certain individuals, without defining, who these are. To put it simply, my advice before tried to stay as general as possible and in that way, it is still correct.</p>
<p>Furthermore, please quote me COMPLETLEY, not just in a way which supports your argument, as this only makes you appear as if you don’t want to understand what I wrote. What I did write wasn’t simply “will break this anonymity”, as you’ve quoted BUT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most add ons offered for the Firefox, will break this anonymity</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The important word lies here in the MOST. This already creates an inherently different meaning, which is absolutely correct. The “size of the haystack”, as you lovingly named it, does get reduced, that is something we can agree on, but for MOST (there it is again) addons, this change in size/traceability isn’t as insignificant, as it may seem. The Tor Browser Bundle in this configuration is used by a massive amount of users, in its pure form. How many these are can only be speculated, but what is definitely sure, is that all these users can’t be pinpoint based on their browser signature. If you, a SINGLE person, may I remind you, now add an addon, which fits in the above mentioned category of addons, which change your fingerprint, you happen to be a SINGLE person, which uses the “normal” TBB signature PLUS this addon, thus you can easily be tracked. If you somehow convince thousands of people to use the TBB with the addon you like, the fingerprinting issue will be less severe, but still exist.</p>

</aside>
<p>Again, I can only give information. I don’t know, who you are, who these “everyone’s” are you mention and what benefit they promise themselfes, by adding addons to the TBB. All I can do, is say, that fingerprinting is a massive issue, because that is a fact.</p>

<p>Let alone it is a far stretch from a less common fingerprint to government authorities showing up on your doorstep with incontrovertible proof that you are their guy.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First of all, what do you mean with “fear mongering”? I use the TBB in the way recommended by the Tor project (Source: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability</a> Please read in its entirety, as to understand the way the TBB was designed) and that is considered suspicious?</p>
<p>Next, how did you get from “Fingerprinting is an issue”, to “activity the general population considers to be so nefarious that they are willing to see government consume large resources to find you”? I’m not even going to explain to you how this doesn’t have anything to do with this topic, nor that there are dozens of use cases for the Tor project, which are tolerated or even needed by the public and require anonymity. Journalism, …</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry, lost me again. So a lot of people (at least in the EU) don’t care about their rights to stay anonymous in the slightest. A few do. Is this to be considered an “aggravation”? Or isn’t it the case, that the people, which don’t know the importance of anonymity, need to be educated by the people which do care and have the knowledge?</p>

<p>Again, who are “they”? And, how do you get to “improve their use experience” and “or they wouldn’t be adding it”. Because if you are saying that there are people which want to enrich “their use experience" and do so by adding addons, first of all, it would be nice to know how “they” want to “improve their use experience” and second, (again) who these people are, since I haven’t heard from that many which, after properly educating themselves, voluntarily add addons to the TBB, as they are aware of the consequences this can have.</p>

I’d understand, if my posts would be the only ones, which are problematic for you, as then I would know that I need to improve my phrasing (something which is true either way), though this isn’t the case. Maybe it is possible, that you are just like me, someone who sometimes misunderstands and doesn’t know everything, just like a human usually does, though from what I’ve read, you are with certainty more capable then anyone else and only have initial problems with some explanations, because they didn’t reach the high quality, your mind needs to comprehend such simple things.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Regarding my “far to general” comment about add ons, let me say this:</p>
<p>One of the main ways, anonymity is accomplished when using the TBB, is by maximising the amount of users, surfing with the exact same fingerprint. This is done, as to make tracking based on things like canvas fingerprinting, the add ons you’ve installed, etc. as hard as possible. Most add ons offered for the Firefox, will break this anonymity, thus websites you visit, can tell the difference between you and the dozens of other people using the TBB. While I can agree with you that there may be a few rare add ons which don’t change your fingerprint in any way visible to others, finding such in it of itself would be quite a task and mostly not worth the effort necessary. Adding to that, most add ons which would be beneficial to anonymity/security while browsing will change your fingerprint, simple because that’s how they are designed. That’s why, if there really is an add on you believe would benefit the TBB and its users, it would be the best, to simply create an enquiry on whether it should be added. Maybe there is already a discussion happening about it, which weighs all pro’s and con’s.</p>
<p>What I just mentioned is for example the reason why, despite Tails already having included it, there is no AdBlocker included with Whonix.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

<p>Yes, traffic always goes through Tor, also without TorButton. What TorButton is good for is documented here: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser#Torbutton">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser#Torbutton</a></p>

<p>TorButton also configures the proxy settings of Firefox. The dynamic socks user name per browser tab for browser tab isolation cannot be done manually.</p>

<p>things still go down that path, but without TorButton aren’t magically massaged to be acceptable to the next hop?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks for the confirmation that it should work.</p>
<p>I have to assume then that NoScript or some other addon is blocking things. I’ll have to investigate further, perhaps starting up in safe mode. Except that would disable Tor as well, which probably wouldn’t be good.</p>
<p>An easy reason for being useful would be if you had to reinstall TBB, or wanted to use a 2nd profile. What has been particularly useful in the past is having all one’s addons come back automagically in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Agreed - no alternate candidates in the wikipedia link.</p>

<p>To be honest, you claimed in your initial post, that there was incompatibility were there is non.

            <p>I hear you. I understand ESR.</p>
<p>However, when I tried, it wouldn’t work. Or I wouldn’t have posted the question. Firefox’s current website sync is not interested in this browser version, apparently as of about a month ago. It wants to upgrade the current version of the app’s sync, and the only way for it to do so is to upgrade firefox. Since I know of no new ESR version, and this Tor browser was installed within the last week or so, I don’t expect Tor browser has since been updated, becoming compatible with the new sync.</p>
<p>I was not looking for your recommendation, I simply asked if anyone knew of another free/FOSS compatible sync service for current torbrowser out there?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>the TBB is based on Firefox ESR. The ESR, as you can tell from here: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/</a> means, that version 38.4.0 in this case, actually is based on the “standard release” of Firefox 42.0, which in turn does support the newest version of Firefox sync. Recommending an alternative is rather hard, as there seem to be only few which have End-to-End encryption integrated in the way Firefox sync does.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>ok, I simply wasn’t thinking anyone would ever want to synchronise between different iterations of the TBB using this system. Regarding that, there has actually been a discussion a long while back, see: <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7188">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7188</a></p>
<p>As it is being End-To-End encrypted, it seems to be something, which could be used for bookmarks, though not for things like Addons, as that would ruin the anonymity provided by the TBB. If you really want to use it though, I have to recommend doing the whole syncing process by yourself, as it can never be said, what happens with your data on mozillas servers, see here: <a href="http://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync.html">http://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync.html</a></p>
<p>As far as I can tell though, there is no incompatibility between the version used in the TBB and the current Firefox iteration, so I can’t really see, on what your initially question is based on. Simply click on “Sync” (in the TBB), “Get Started”, activate JavaScript if you haven’t already and log in using credentials, only used with the TBB, as otherwise, you can and will get linked to your TBB usage, “Sign Up” and mark “Choose what to sync”, verify your mail and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>Perhaps you didn’t know …</p>
<p>Firefox has a built in sync service for syncing browser bookmarks, addons, and the like across browser installations/profiles.</p>
<p>It’s the only sync in relation to firefox that I know of. SyncML, et al, doesn’t apply to firefox.</p>
<p>In firefox (torbrowser), see edit / preferences / sync.</p>
