    <title>Suggested distro for host on usb?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/suggested-distro-for-host-on-usb/9015</link>
    <description>Hi, I want to install whonix on usb (is it not ok for some reason?). 
I would directly install debian as host on usb but i wonder if there are some other stable, debian based (since then i think i will install kicksecure) and maybe security focused distro that are lighter than debian. is a linux like that exist?

Thanks</description>
