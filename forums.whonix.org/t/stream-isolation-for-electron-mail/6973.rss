    <title>Stream Isolation for Electron Mail</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/stream-isolation-for-electron-mail/6973</link>
    <description>Hi I am using a great app called[Electron Mail](https://github.com/vladimiry/ElectronMail) that lets you manage multiple protonmail accounts and maintain isolation and separation. All accounts log through the .onion site which is also good. I am a little confused how to properly implement stream isolation here since it is one app handling multiple accounts simultaneously to protonmail&#39;s onion website. The wiki is not really easy to understand on this.. but it provides these options: 

* Without *IsolateDestAddr* and without *IsolateDestPort* : SocksPort 10.152.152.10:9153 to 9159
* With *IsolateDestAddr* , but without *IsolateDestPort* : SocksPort 10.152.152.10:9160 to 9169
* Without *IsolateDestAddr* , but with *IsolateDestPort* : SocksPort: 10.152.152.10:9170 to 9179
* With *IsolateDestAddr* and with *IsolateDestPort* : SocksPort: 10.152.152.10:9180 to 9189

I am using as the proxy socks5://10.152.152.10:9153 for all the accounts (you specify a proxy for each account). But I am not sure if this is the best choice. Looking for some advice or tips I did review the tor wiki I think it is saying the isolation if the same &quot;stream&quot; is accessing different &quot;addresses&quot; but since this stream is accessing the same address multiple times simultaneously i stayed with the option that does not provide port or destination isolation (10.152.152.10:9153). But I could be misunderstanding everything so I thought I would just check which option provides best protection for this scenario</description>

            <p>Hi <code>bz3ipfptl2</code></p>
<p>While this app provides a cool feature I would strongly  recommend against using it. If your VM is ever compromised all of your identities could be linked to one another. It is recommend that you use <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstations" rel="nofollow noopener">Multiple Whonix-Workstations</a> to separate each torified client or identity.</p>
<p>Your question can be answered as per:<a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle</a></p>
<p>To point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Since this is not a Whonix specific issue I would first read the torproject documentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en" rel="nofollow noopener">https://torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en</a></p>
<p>If you still need help you could ask the electronmail devs for some guidance here:</p>
