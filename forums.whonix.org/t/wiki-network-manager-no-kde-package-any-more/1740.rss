    <description>wiki: [Network_Manager](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Network_Manager)

``&gt; sudo apt-get install network-manager-kde

There (currently) appears to be no network-manager-kde package (any more?).

Feels like the contents are already / now included within the network-manager package itself, which is &#39;pre&#39;-installed.

``- so wiki network manager start / install section can be removed / modified. (So people don&#39;t chase their tail looking for a package that doesn&#39;t exist. Right repository? [&#39;broken&#39;] aptitude not working? Wha ...)

At vm install, a network icon already appears next to the time.

Sadly, it has a goofy / alarming big yellow question mark in it.

Some, like myself, will click on it, wonder why there is no network, why isn&#39;t there a network!, ifconfig, poke, prod, and otherwise chase their tail for a while ... giving up  ... to realize, eventually ... the network is working fine, the icon&#39;s buggy. (Which anyone familiar with NetworkManager will be completely unsurprised at. But not to &#39;blame&#39; for, here. [As wiki article explains. Should such affected users ever even see it.])

``&gt; make it visible in Network Manger, by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf ...

``&gt; managed=true

I suggest that managed=true should be the default / initial whonix setting. (If the icon is going to be present by default - certainly my preference.) At least the yellow question mark goes away, people clicking on it see a &#39;viable&#39; network, stats, think network and life good, and move on.

The wiki notes:
``&gt; That would be quite useful, if changing settings where possible.

(Assuming correct / network changes via that interface are impossible) I would guess that fewer will encounter or be bothered by an inexplicable reason for changes to not take / be enterable, than get puzzled by a mysterious yellow question mark and/or would appreciate seeing stats at first blush / receiving immediate / positive feedback that the network is functioning.

Summary:
``&gt; sudo apt-get install network-manager-kde
``- can be removed
``&gt; managed=true
``- should be the default</description>

<p>In essence we are distributing VM images. [No matter the meta data, wrapped into ova for VirtualBox, xz for KVM or rpm for Qubes.] The VM images are created using the Whonix build script. Nothing manually. Fully automated. Using tools like debootstrap, apt-get.</p>

<p>Ack! Sorry … my bad … wiki text gave me the impression that this was a whonix (pre)seeded file.</p>
<p>If it isn’t … same problem as with aptitude, I agree.</p>
<p>Hold on … except … this is a change in the vm, and quite within a reasonable norm of package use.</p>
<p>Guess I’m assuming, then, that the vm is an image, not a result built on the fly at initial vm instantiation time.</p>
<p>Alternately, a /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/30_whonix type file could be seeded?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>This is difficult.</p>
<ul>
<li>because writing to config files owned by other packages which leads to<br>
all kinds of issues</li>
<li>must make sure it doesn’t have any ill effects now or in future of<br>
having these interfaces now “managed” by network manager</li>
