    <title>Sys-firewall - networkmanager won&#39;t run / cannot enable nm-applet</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/sys-firewall-networkmanager-wont-run-cannot-enable-nm-applet/2706</link>
    <description>I have installed qubes-whonix. After having updated everything and everything appearing to be in working order I rebooted to finalize updates to the fedora template. Once the machine rebooted I logged onto qubes to find that I no longer had bootstrapping error with connecting to tor. However, I now get a little square in the system tray, when I right clock on it and select &#39;About&#39; I get a little window with the heading &#39;[sys-firewall] About NetworkManager Applet&#39;. This networkmanager applet is not running as said by the bubble that appears when I hover over the small box. The prompt to enable it is also shaded out. 

I have been unable to find any information on this. I do not have the knowledge to understand the implications of this. Appreciate any help in understanding or even solving this issue. 

Thank you</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Sorry to tell you, but from what I can tell, this isn’t a question related to Whonix directly. Please thus ask in the Qubes forums.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
