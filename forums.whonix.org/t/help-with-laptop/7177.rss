    <title>Help with laptop?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/help-with-laptop/7177</link>
    <description>I just looked at the Qubes hardware compatibility list but unfortunately most of the laptops listed there can’t be bought brand new or cost way too much like over 1K. I thought that a brand new laptop would be more secure in the following way. Let’s say they manage to break Qubes and Whonix’s security and to infect a malware in the laptop, in this case they would learn everything about the laptop. If the laptop is a brand new one bought with cash, they wouldn’t learn much about it but if it’s an used one bought online, it would be a bit easier to trace the buyer since he/she would use a debit card to buy it. Is my thought right or am I missing something?</description>

            <p>Hi <code>Samuelito</code></p>
<p>If there is a paper trail it could be linked back to you. However, if<br>
the Whonix and/or Qubes security model was broken it wouldn’t matter<br>
much since your external IP address would be exposed.</p>
