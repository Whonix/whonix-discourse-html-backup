    <title>Gateway not booting (black screen) - can be booted without internet access?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/gateway-not-booting-black-screen-can-be-booted-without-internet-access/1102</link>
    <description>I sometimes have the problem, that when powering up the gateway it boots not past a black screen. 
The grub loader appears, some boot text, but then black screen before the KDE surface.
then I reset the machine and most often it boots normally. But not always.

I think it is because the host was sometimes not connected to an internet. But this is just a guess, I tested it right now with internet connection and it did not boot.
Question: Can the Gateway be booted without internet access? Without being connected to a WLAN/Ethernet? (tor does not work obviously, its booting to KDE surface only)


(changed Gateway to 1 GB RAM)</description>

            <p>No, it does nothing. Just a black screen.</p>
<p>€dit:<br>
Sorry, its not the workstation, its the gateway.</p>
<p>€dit2:<br>
gateway has not been modified, except RAM. No additional packages were installed. No response on the consoles. Just black.<br>
I let it run for a few hours, nothing but one CPU of the host system is constantly at 100% load because of virtualbox. No other VMs running.</p>
<p>€dit3:<br>
Even a reset did not work.<br>
I had to power down the VM. Now it boots flawlessly.</p>

            <p>Yes, it should boot fine without network access.</p>
<p>Black means totally black without any text?</p>
<p>Can you change virtual consoles? (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles</a>)</p>
