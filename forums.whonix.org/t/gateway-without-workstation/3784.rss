    <title>Gateway without Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/gateway-without-workstation/3784</link>
    <description>I would like to use Whonix as a gateway for Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux VMs that would be administered by untrusted third parties. I could install Whonix workstation as their base system, but since they would have root access to their VMs, they could easily just replace it with another system anyway, so let&#39;s just assume that it will end up as a vanilla (and possibly even malicious) GNU/Linux workstation.

Is this a possible alternative use case for Whonix?

PS. Sorry if this is answered somewhere, but when searching I could only find mention of the _reverse_ use case, ie. using Workstation without Gateway.</description>
