    <title>I need to change &#39;Nouveau&#39; settings to &#39;Nvidia&#39; In my fresh Qubes Installation.</title>

    <description>I have installed Qubes 3.1 on my GTX-970 FX-8350 AMD

I was having issues with the &#39;Nouveau&#39; settings, since my pc is configured
to Kali OS. It was running Nvidia Overclocked and had Nouveau removed. My concern is 
with the kernel and display settings. I dont want to break the whole Qubes installation
messing with the settings, anyone have any suggestions?Appreciate responses...</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Sorry to tell you, but as this isn’t a Whonix specific question, no one here will be able to help you with this. Please consider asking in the Qubes forum.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
