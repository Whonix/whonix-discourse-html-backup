    <description>A new SoC made in Russia makes its debut. After the Snowden revelations, non-US countries got a kick in the nuts to produce their own tech in-house. This is one initiative. Ladies and gentlemen... the [Baikal](https://www.baikalelectronics.com/) board. 

Cue the jokes, &quot;Enjoy your FSB backdoors&quot; and &quot;In Soviet Russia computer programs you&quot;. Its a healthy sign for the human race that finally more than one country has the brains to design its own microchips after more than 60 years later.</description>

<p><em><strong>Offtopic: Since you’re Russian can you tell us how popular Tor and Whonix are there? Also I noticed some exits there block some content but others don’t. Is there a unified censorship regime or is it up to each ISP to decide what to block?</strong></em></p>
<p>very popular))) yes it’s unified list at <a href="http://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru" rel="nofollow noopener">blocklist.rkn.gov.ru</a> - smart services just as this very cool sample I first met friGate which is now eats TOR/Blockchain DNS - intimcity.link - just hang advice on few fresh mirrors to use tor / vpn / friGate etc addons with links so goin right - people not met any difficults, being ever so far as aliens from hi-tech))) which shows other just laziness)))</p>
<p>can’t say about further TOR IP locking as other initiatives as SSL attacks / BRIC intranet etc, assume it’s sur fantasy for this country as you may see in news lol - but Blockchain DNS being used with same site and links within google robot descript as above solves)))</p>
<p>Blockchain DNS works without TOR, with only one plugin such as popular usable and one click install friGate - irresistable for abuse / ddos / track etc so in trend now in most darknet, and further mb clearnet)))</p>
<p>there works other most effective type of abuse - real prison courts end up to 3 years and some cases even blowed much more, for government / church / other you wish authorities criticism in posts at resources that function under country law - it appears in terrorism cases, extremism etc - massive))) but I seen in EU there also same habbits, so you can get fine fee in $100k’s and even prison, in ru same fines also applies wide…</p>
<p>and, there was a project of same liability for using anonymisers - later became project of blocking vpn etc… now as their ass spread it’s forgotten, but further maybe it raise from knees again)))</p>
<p>that’s why I think such initiatives as tor / whonix / blockchain dns informing actual not only in censed cases…</p>
