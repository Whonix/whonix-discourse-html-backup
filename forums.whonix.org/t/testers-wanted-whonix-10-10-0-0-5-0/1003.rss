&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changelog between Whonix 9 and Whonix 10.0.0.5.0:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– build script: added retry feature to error handler; refactoring; output

– build script: added –auto-retry (default: 1) and –wait-auto-retry (default: 5) to error handler

– build script: implemented –dispatch-before-retry and –dispatch-after-retry

– ram adjusted desktop starter (rads): compatibility with gdm3

workaround for

&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745735&quot;&gt;apt: Provide meaningful exit codes for gpg failures&lt;/a&gt;

W: A error occurred during the signature verification.

To catch situations such as:

The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used.

GPG error: http://deb.torproject.org stable Release: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681

That apt-repository would otherwise be silently ignored without error notification.

– whonixcheck: output

– added &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-gwenview&quot;&gt;https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-gwenview&lt;/a&gt; to Whonix’s APT repository – thanks to @troubadoour

– package selection: install xserver-xorg-video-qxl by default (added xserver-xorg-video-qxl to anon-shared-desktop to aid kvm users getting higher desktop resolutions as per https://forums.whonix.org/t/higher-resolution-desktop/471 (thanks to HulaHoop for suggesting this))

– package selection: install kde-privacy by default (added kde-privacy to anon-shared-packages-recommended)

– added new package &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Whonix/kde-privacy&quot;&gt;kde-privacy&lt;/a&gt; that deactivates deletes klipper contents on exit – thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php?action=profile;u=94&quot;&gt;z&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,517.msg4087.html#msg4087&quot;&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt;

The grub-pc should be already get installed in build-steps.d/1300_create-raw-image build step by grml-debootstrap (./grml_packages) which is fine for VM builds. For –install-to-root users it’s unnecessary, since they already have a booting system.

– sdwdate: Replaced `sdwdate`’s use of GNU `date` for converting untrusted date from remote servers with a `python` script /usr/lib/sdwdate/date_to_unixtime that uses `dateutil.parser`. Thanks to troubadoour for the review of usr/lib/sdwdate/date_to_unixtime.

timesync: when running timesync, always set clock using `date`, not `sclockadj`

– build script: deprecated –no-validate-libvirt-xml

– build script: implemented –conffile

– sdwdate: stricter sudoers exceptions

– sdwdate: sclockadj fix: Fail when run (as normal user) without rights to change clock. Check return codes of clock_gettime and clock_settime. https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/370

– tb-updater: Store and show last known signature creation date. – Useful to detect downgrade or infinite freeze attack. – https://phabricator.whonix.org/T96

– tb-updater: Authenticate file names. This is useful to detect a downgrade or indefinite freeze attack. To do this, the sha256sums.txt file needs to be verified using the sha256sums.txt.asc file.

– makefile: prepend package-version folder in upstream tarball

– makefile: made hardcoded list of folders to install (“bin boot dev etc home lib opt sbin srv sys usr var”) overwriteable through variable make_folder_list_for_un_and_install

– makefile: output

<p>10.0.0.5.0 testers-only users who got the upgraded anon-shared-packages-dependencies (&gt;= 3:1.9-1) package can safely “sudo apt-get autoremove” or “sudo apt-get purge console-setup” [because it will no longer depend on console-setup] or just get a fresh 10.0.0.5.5 build to fix this issue.</p>

            <p>Yes, there is an issue. No one including me seems to have noticed the following during upgrade.</p>
<p><code>The following packages will be REMOVED:
  anon-gateway-packages-recommended whonix-gateway
</code></p>
<p>As a quick fix, try this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Removal of control-port-filter and installation of control-port-filter-python is expected.</p>
<p>The real fix will come in next testers-only version.</p>

Me too.</p>
<p>ERROR: Control Port Filter Proxy Test Result:<br>

Please report this Whonix bug!</p>
<p>And it persist after reboot.<br>
There is no control-port-filter-python in /var/run<br>
It is only a “controlportfilter” there.<br>

            <p>1 mirror down. 2 mirrors outdated.</p>
<p>“You happened to get the mirror that is currently outdated / down. Should fix itself randomly on a new round of apt-get update and dist-upgrade or in ~3 hours or so.”</p>
<p>I am wondering if switching from sourceforge to Whonix mirror was worth the trouble. Whonix mirror is faster at apt-get update and less likely to result in “Could not OpenPGP verify authenticity of Whonix News” (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,595.0.html">https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,595.0.html</a>) issues. On the other hand, in the last 3 days most likely a lot overhead was generated by outdated/broken mirrors.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="mention">@z</span><br>
Most likely an outdated mirror issues (see above).<br>
Please tell me if it persists (in &gt;3 hours + after upgrade)!<br>
The function to skip would be: check_control_port_filter_running</p>
<blockquote>The next Tor Browser version will set the default search engine as Disconnect, but Whonix welcome page is set to search on Startpage, is that ok?</blockquote>
You tell me. Bug or feature?
<blockquote>Will Whonix support circuit visualization in Tor Browser?</blockquote>
Most likely, no, because we don't want Whonix-Workstation to have circuit information.

            <p>By the way, no worries. As long as you notice such issues and don’t do unauthenticated installations, it’s all fine. Any skilled, successful attack would result in a unnoticeable permanent compromise. Since the release is new, as long as the issue gets fixed anytime not too far from now, there is no need to stop doing something else.</p>

            <p>mitm is possible, but it’s more likely, that you happed to get the mirror that is currently down. Should fix itself after a while and a new round of apt-get update and dist-upgrade.</p>

<p>because i saw the package in the build script:-</p>
<blockquote>– build script: added packages python-guimessages and packages/whonix-setup-wizard</blockquote>
<p>but why its not authenticated?</p>
<p>so i couldnt even install tor for now till getting sure that this is safe to agree on.</p>

<p>– added <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-gwenview">https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-gwenview</a> to Whonix’s APT repository – thanks to <span class="mention">@troubadoour</span></p>
<p>– package selection: install xserver-xorg-video-qxl by default (added xserver-xorg-video-qxl to anon-shared-desktop to aid kvm users getting higher desktop resolutions as per <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/higher-resolution-desktop/471" class="inline-onebox">Higher resolution desktop</a> (thanks to HulaHoop for suggesting this))</p>

<p>– build script: implemented –ignore-uncommitted</p>
<p>– build-script: Use <code>git clean</code> rather than “make deb-cleanup” for better security. It is also faster.</p>
<p>– build-script: No longer use <code>sort</code> in cleanup step for better security.</p>
<p>– build-script: No longer automatically cleanup before package building.</p>
<p>– build-script: moved whonix_build to help-steps/whonix_build_one</p>

<p>– updated frozen sources</p>
<p>– anon-meta-packages: Removed grub-pc from anon-shared-packages-dependencies. This is a weird dependency. The grub-pc should be already get installed in build-steps.d/1300_create-raw-image build step by grml-debootstrap (./grml_packages) which is fine for VM builds. For –install-to-root users it’s unnecessary, since they already have a booting system. As per <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/342">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/342</a>.</p>
<p>– added new package: <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/usability-misc">usability-misc</a></p>
<p>– package selection: added usability-misc to anon-shared-packages-recommended</p>
<p>– poweroff-passwordless: only for user “user”, not for all users</p>
<p>– bootclockrandomization: Set OLD_UNIXTIME variable right before calculation of NEW_UNIXTIME so calculation gets more accurate. Thanks to intrigeri for pointing that out!
