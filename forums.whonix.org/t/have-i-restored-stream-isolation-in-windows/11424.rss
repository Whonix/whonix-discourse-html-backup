    <title>Have I restored stream isolation in Windows?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/have-i-restored-stream-isolation-in-windows/11424</link>
    <description>I now run a operating system as L1 that is  directed trough Whonix by internal network. In L1 in run Windows as L2. 

In Windows L2  I use proxyfier and has set up a different proxy for every application. I wounder if the stream isolation normally created by the workstation is partly or fully restored now? I&#39;m mostly curious. Its also related to some othere stuff. 

Of course there are other integrity issues with Windows. As a side note however I do think that  broozer fingerprinting can be completely resolved in this configuration after modifying mozila.</description>

<p>Having trouble picturing how you have this configured, but you might be<br>
able to see if your proxify setup has stream isolation by monitoring Tor<br>
connections in Whonix Gateway. Then, open two different<br>
applications/browsers and attempt to access the same address from both,<br>
and see if Tor opens two streams or one.</p>
<p>Note that you will likely be unable to achieve the per-tab stream<br>
isolation of Tor Browser with your configuration.</p>

            <p>If any one wounder what the nested aspect is for its because I could not set up proxy in L1. Probably because it altered use tor gateway as a proxy.</p>
<p>Perhaps Im ignorant. And that might be apparent in the topic it self.</p>
