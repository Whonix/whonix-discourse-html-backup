    <title>Debugging isolated Multi-WS setup</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/debugging-isolated-multi-ws-setup/648</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve opened a separate thread as per recommendation. I believe that there must be some discrepancy between how internal networks work in different virtualizer. That makes debugging more difficult to pin point.

This function shouldn&#39;t been seen as a &quot;task&quot;. I just think it would be nice to have and document for KVM folks.

The steps I applied to debug is to run tcpdump on eth2. logs show that packets from the non-connecting ws 2 do have an ip of [b]10.152.152.12[/b]. That means that the ws does have an ip assigned so no problem there. Reasons for why no packets are making it past that point are, I speculate, because no rules are applied to traffic coming from it. iptables on gw can deal with eth1 traffic but it doesn&#39;t know anything about an eth2 or how to treat it. This causes it to do the failsafe of default block all traffic coming from eth2.

Again more speculation but I think if the iptables script on gw is modified to automatically apply eth1 rules to any (eth1+n)  interface that should do it.

If you have any different ideas on what I should do next, I&#39;m all ears.</description>

<p>Yes I realise it was a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It cannot be solved by Q/A style. Technically the looks quite obvious to me. Just needs bash and some iptables knowledge and several hours of work.</p>

<p>Ok I see, makes sense.</p>
<blockquote>If you want https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstations#How_to_use_more_than_one_Whonix-Workstation_-_EASY (without multiple separate internal networks) to work with KVM should go into a separate thread.</blockquote>
<p>I was confused by the page’s title, but now that you explained its actually about multi-ws on the same internal network I report that it has always worked without any changes needed on my part. I never had to apply these instructions for it to work.</p>

your question</p>
<blockquote>How difficult is it to do this so that all firewall rules for eth1 are auto-duplicated for any n number of internal network interfaces that the gateway auto-detects has been added to it - while maintaining complete separation between workstations on different internal networks?</blockquote>
<p>was answered by me and I implicitly said it’s not supported by <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-gw-firewall">https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-gw-firewall</a> yet.</p>
