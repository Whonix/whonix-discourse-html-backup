    <title>Works ZMAP?</title>

    <description>Hey,

first of all thanks for this very nice Distro. So far everything but zmap runs perfectly. I have tried zmap with uwt but it will not work.

[code]root@host:/home/user# uwt -t 5 -i 10.152.152.10 -p 9055 zmap --bandwidth=1M --target-port=80 173.194.112.194/24 --output-file=results.csv
Nov 13 18:30:05.351 [WARN] blacklist: ZMap is currently using the default blacklist located at /etc/zmap/blacklist.conf. By default, this blacklist excludes locally scoped networks (e.g. 10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.1/8, and 192.168.0.0/16). If you are trying to scan local networks, you can change the default blacklist by editing the default ZMap configuration at /etc/zmap/zmap.conf.
