    <title>Multiple Whonix-Gateway - Qubes-Whonix Best Practice</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-whonix-gateway-qubes-whonix-best-practice/11215</link>
    <description>Hello,

I tried to follow the recommendation to *&quot; Increase Protection from Malicious Entry Guards: One Guard per Application&quot;* from : /wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards

So I did follow the steps to create some new Whonix-GWs from : /wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Gateway

Then I linked my different WSs to the different GWs. Everything went well, everything seems to be working so far.

Then only not clear part is the difference between the Originial sys-whonix GW and my newly created GWs.
I can see the original one being less heavy on disk storage (like ~30mb less) than every other one, even they&#39;re (of course) all build from the same template. I guess some packages were removed on the original, and *maybe* some extra config was done on it too.

So the questions are : 
- Why is there a difference between the already created sys-whonix and the newly generated ones ?
- What are the differences ?
- Should I continue to create the dedicated GWs from the template VM or should I clone the original sys-whonix GW then regenerate the tor state file inside ?

I saw topics about multiple GWs being addressed in the past and I used them to answer other questions but I didn&#39;t find answers to theses questions.
I apologize if I didn&#39;t follow some rules or posted in wrong section.

Thanks !</description>

<p>The files in <strong>/rw</strong> that should be the same seem to be the same, at least same size.<br>
The only minor differences I saw were some files generated by anon-wizard, so it looked normal to me.<br>
But unfortunately I can’t guarantee I checked everything the right way.</p>
<p>I also did check the packages to be sure and they match.</p>

<p>This was while <em>“sys-whonix”</em> was running compared to others closed <em>“sys-XX”</em> . When they’re closed the gap is now ~50mb &lt; than others.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel like this chapter used the <em>cloning</em> method because :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is no differentiation between Non-Qubes and Qubes in this chapter, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it was intended to be a <em><strong>-temp</strong></em> Gateway, and it <em>may</em> makes more sense to clone it when it will be soon deleted, and keep the fresh creation for persistent GWs…</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this chapter seems not to be directly connected to the first chapter I’m talking about because in the intro they say : <code>If guard fingerprinting across different locations is a legitimate concern...</code><br>
But in first chapter I feel like we’re talking about a setup to mitigate threat on one <em>main</em>  location, or am I wrong ?</p>
<p>Anyway I agree on the fact that I can’t see why it would be more beneficial to clone a GW in Qubes-Whonix than to <em>fresh</em> create it in any case we want <em>“mitigate tor entry guard fingerprint”</em>.</p>

<p>No research was done into that.<br>
Feel free to research that by yourself.<br>
Since there are <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Why_Whonix_is_Freedom_Software#no_intentional_user_freedom_restrictions">No Intentional User Freedom Restrictions</a>, it’s Open Source, feel free to research that.</p>
<p>Prerequisite knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Qubes#Qubes_Persistence">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Qubes#Qubes_Persistence</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a VM ever used space inside a TemplateBasedVM, it won’t automatically free it even if files in /rw have already been deleted.</li>
<li>Qubes free space calculation issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>This might help. Run in both VMs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo find /rw -type f
</code></pre>
<p>Compare file lists. Gather file sizes. Compare.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But that part <code>(sys-whonix)</code> might just have been injected when these instrutions where <code>Qubes</code>ified. I cannot think of a strong rationale why</p>
<p>A) cloning sys-whonix would be better than,<br>
B) creating a sys-whonix-temp from TemplateVM.</p>
<p>When A), one could keep Tor consensus files but instructions currently don’t cover this and that shouldn’t be important either.</p>
<p>Keep following this forum thread to see if any other insights are posted at a later time.</p>
