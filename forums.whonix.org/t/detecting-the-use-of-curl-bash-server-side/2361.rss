    <title>Detecting the use of &quot;curl | bash&quot; server side</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/detecting-the-use-of-curl-bash-server-side/2361</link>
    <description>Remote servers can change their payload depending on whether they detect curl used standalone or if its outputs are piped into bash. 

https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/

The final advice:

&gt; The better solution is never to pipe untrusted data streams into bash. If you still want to run untrusted bash scripts a better approach is to pipe the contents of URL into a file, review the contents on disk and only then execute it. 


This doesn&#39;t apply to anything Whonix does as files downloaded are always verified before being read/executed.</description>

<p>Not very hard. From my varnish knowledge I’d know how to set up<br>
something like this.</p>
