    <title>[Help] I2P setup for Whonix-gw template</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/help-i2p-setup-for-whonix-gw-template/3497</link>
    <description>Hello, I am trying to create a working I2p Whonix gateway without tunneling I2p through TOR and with non-eepsite related traffic natively going through TOR. Honestly the extra TOR traffic scrub for this gateway isn&#39;t a big deal as I use another VM fro such traffic.

I have been using what I have found out to be an old guide for such a think.
[OLD guide](https://github.com/cle4r/var/blob/master/Whonix-I2P-Guide-OLD.txt)

 I was actually a little over 50% through the guide when I found his thread saying that it will not work with the newest Qubes R3.2.
[Kill Your TV Guide](https://www.whonix.org/pipermail/whonix-devel/2016-January/000501.html)
This one is a year old as well. This one here is 11 months old and uses the above guide in its guide.

I am starting to get confused and didn&#39;t really think it was going to be this complicated but I guess with Qubes, everything is complicated.

So I am thinking of scrapping the gateway template I have been configuring and start fresh but I am wondering if anyone knows of a better Whonix Gateway I2P guide or one that is up to date at least?

Let me know if I am over complicating it. Any help is appreciated, thank you for your time.</description>

            <p>I think it’s fine if you do it here, there is no need to hassle with Github, I’m going to create a new Repo once it’s working and tested.<br>
If you have any questions left, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your Help</p>

            <p>I would like to document my progress very well but I am new to github. Is there any way of sort of creating a journal of sorts of my step by step process to submit to the team? Should I do it here or on Github. I plan to sit down tomorrow and work through it.</p>

            <p>Great, it would help me a lot, i haven’t had the time to test it in a while ,however i’ve got some time this week to revisit and test everything. It’s good to know that there is still a demand for I2p-Whonix and, a good motivational boost to continue this work;)<br>
Any feedback is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I will have to wait a couple days until I can sit down and test it out on a fresh Whonix Gateway template and I will let you know of the output code and any hiccups along the way. When I get the time however, I would love to help test it out.</p>

            <p>Hi Pen16,<br>
I decided against the guide , because it was getting pretty complicated and required many Steps the User had to do. So i created a few scripts to do the Job , you can find them also in my repo (<a href="https://github.com/cle4r/var/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/cle4r/var/</a>) there is still a lot to do and i haven’t had the Time to fix and update it.<br>
But it should get you a bit closer to a working setup if you take a look at the Scripts and the old Guide.(It should now work on Qubes 3.2 )</p>
<p>Maybe you can help me test and fix the Problems that are still there</p>
<p>I hope i helped you a bit <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
