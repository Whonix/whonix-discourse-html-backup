    <title>Configuring new application for Tor in Whonix-Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/configuring-new-application-for-tor-in-whonix-workstation/1379</link>
    <description>For work, I use charting software. Before Whonix, I&#39;d install the program and configure it to use SOCKS v5 : 9150 to get the stream via Tor. I&#39;ve now installed that program in Whonix-Workstation. 

- Do I still need to configure it for Tor proxy or no... Since it is forced through Whonix-Gateway anyway (therefore Tor)?

- If I did configure it as before (SOCKS v5 : 9150), would that, then, cause a Tor-over-Tor scenario?

Thank you.</description>

Always though Tor so or so.
However, configuring SocksPorts is useful for stream isolation.

No.
