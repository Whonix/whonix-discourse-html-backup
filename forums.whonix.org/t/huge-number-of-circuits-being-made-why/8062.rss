    <title>huge number of circuits being made , why ?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/huge-number-of-circuits-being-made-why/8062</link>
    <description>I was watching the nyx connections page, and noticed a very large number of circuits being built. Sometimes 20 , and even up to 90.
What is normal ? How can I see the processes that are requesting these circuits ?  I run gajim messenger , if that matters, but I think I&#39;ve seen this without that even running.
I was thinking that this is a big security hole, as something could keep requesting new circuits until a rouge / &#39;Bad&#39; machine is reached in an effective  place for snooping .</description>

</aside>
<p>It’s most likely that nothing is opening them manually. Tor creates new circuits automatically if the one it has attempted to use doesn’t work and the network seems to be under a lot of load.</p>

<p>Yes, sending a NEWNYM signal to the Tor control port will make it create a new circuit.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding.<br>
When I saw 90 circuits I thought something is going wrong. A fundemental question on the Tor curcuit workings: Can a user process request a new circuit to be built ? If that was the case, maybe the slew of requests could be monitored or trapped in some way. I’m not comfortable with this going on. Not sure if there is a debug mode or some other way to watch what Tor itself is up to.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/a_whonixer">@a_whonixer</a> I had wondered the same thing about the number of circuits. I make a thread about it. In my situation, dozens of circuits were being made and almost immediately destroyed. My connection was not interrupted and no crashes of Tor. I only noticed it if i went into Nyx or Onion Circuits.<br>
Since other people had the same thing happen to them, we can be pretty sure its just something on Tor’s side.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forums and thank you for your question.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a good question. However, Whonix isn’t the producer of Tor. Whonix is a Linux distribution, an integration project. The developers of Tor will probably have a better answer to this.</p>
<p>Comparison with Tor running outside of Whonix is always a good idea.</p>
<p>To understand why that is, please kindly also have a look at <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems" rel="nofollow noopener">Linux User Experience versus Commercial Operating Systems</a> and <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle" rel="nofollow noopener">Free Support Principle</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>“Same way you would do that when using Tor outside of Whonix.”</p>
<p>On Whonix-Gateway: It’s difficult but that may not be surprising since this is a difficult question. As far as I know there is no easy tool to see that. By the time traffic ends up on Whonix-Gateway, the information which process the connection originated from is lost and may only be restructured/guessed by using network analyzers such as tshark / wireshark which are non-trivial to use.</p>
<p>Again, “not a Whonix specific problem”, this would happen on any “Tor client running on a different machine than the application” setup.</p>
<p>On Whonix-Workstation: Scrutinizing the traffic on Whonix-Workstation is a bit easier using the usual Linux tools but rootkits could just hide themselves from such analysis.</p>

<p>This may be true but is again something which would have to be solved in Tor. It’s an unresolved Tor research task as far as I know.</p>
<p>See this ticket which I created 7 years ago:<br>
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5928" rel="nofollow noopener">Research: IP discovery through Tor behind isolated network</a></p>
<p>See it that way. 7 years ago, it wasn’t easy to make sure that Tor gets used while using a general purpose operating system. That was solved. See:</p>
