&lt;p&gt;If you live in the Anglo-sphere and think “well I’m safe this is everyone else’s problem”, – besides the faulty morals behind the view that non-citizens deserve less rights and protections against this aggressive illegal behavior, it is a mistake to assume that these capabilities are only available to intelligence agencies with enormous black budgets. Hijacking and diverting internet traffic of other countries has happened repeatedly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/rerouting_inter.html&quot;&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;, without having a privileged position on internet backbone. The unencrypted traffic can be poisoned by any attacking state. QUANTUM-like systems are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/quantum_technol.html&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; for any anemic dictatorship with a million dollars to spare as revealed in the Gamma International hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are security “vendors” who always use news like this to mislead and con the uninformed public into buying some ineffective product such as an antivirus. Others buy into the false promises and laughable charade of politicians passing privacy legislation with loopholes preserving the status quo. There are ways to take the fate of your online life and privacy in your own hands and to start protecting yourself from this very moment. They are completely free in every sense of the meaning both in controlling and auditing what runs on your computer and in cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GNU/Linux Free Software OS that is transparent and security centric. It can be installed as your host system on any hardware out there. You can set up your workflow so that any internet interaction be done exclusively through Whonix, running on the built-in KVM hypervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
