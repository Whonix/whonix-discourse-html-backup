    <title>First Live Date of New Onion Site</title>

    <description>Dear Whonix Team,

I see, due to the recently published &quot;Heartbleed&quot; bug, that Whonix has a new hidden services .onion address (xxxxxxxxxxh5kyrx.onion).

So that I can get some accurate information for my &quot;Verification Assets&quot; work, could you confirm the very first date that the new xxxxxxxxxxh5kyrx.onion address went live on the internet for the Whonix site?

Was it today (April 8, 2014) or yesterday (April 7, 2014) or another date?

Thank you.</description>

            <p>Thanks Patrick and fortasse.</p>
<p>And yes, this Whonix SSL fingerprint signature is likely to be of some additional value to my Verification Assets work.</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up, Patrick!</p>

            <p>Thanks to fortasse acting fast on this one.</p>
<p>Depends on the time zone?</p>
<p>Didn’t note the time. Approximately April 8, 2014, 5 am, using UTC+1(berlin time zone). Blog post about this to come.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Datenschutz#Technical_Information">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Datenschutz#Technical_Information</a> and footnotes may be interesting for verifiable assets as well. Contains gpg signed (by me) ssl fingerprints. I plan on posting gpg signed ssl fingerprint, domain and .onion domain. [For whatever that’s worth, since gandi [commercial server host] could steal any keys and our domain anyway. Sad security standards all over the internet.]</p>
