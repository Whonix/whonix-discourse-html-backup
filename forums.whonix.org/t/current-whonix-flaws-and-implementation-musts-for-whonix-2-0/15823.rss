    <description>this post details number of glaring security holes in Whonix and it&#39;s current design, while most of Linux desktop is affected by this, the risks can be greatly reduced, massive performance gains and easier to audit

I am willing to develop a &quot;testing sample&quot; of how Whonix 2.0 should be, if approved I wont mind being maintainer. BUT first I have to explain major security issues and their resolution

if you look at modern desktop Linux with plenty of different flavors, you will see one thing in common, they all suck at security, they provide fake security with words &quot;apparmor&quot; &quot;contained&quot; when in reality these apps can access everything most of time.

linux kernel is huge, bloated attack surface but if that bloat is used, you can make very secure system examples!
* Replacing pipewire and pulseaudio with Linux&#39;s built-in ALSA
* Removing D-Bus, Polkit, Gsd, Gvfsd and more useless daemons
* switching to Busybox is more secure than normal Linux
* switching to Doas is more secure than Sudo
* Switching away from super insecure XFCE xOrg to Wayland window manager
* Switching Debian with alpine due to more updated packages, more secure package manager, Musl which is more secure than Glibc, Musl is lighter (around 1 million code less) and handles memory a lot more securely
* switching from Debian to alpine should pose no technical challenge as alpine has plenty of packages and is used by professional companies and is not amateur project
* Enforcing either SELinux or apparmor strictly and for all apps, it&#39;s better if app breaks than app hacks :slight_smile: 
* having a custom app in workstation that only starts on first startup which has nice interface and lets user click for software he wants to install instead of bundling everything in the Whonix image, what if he don&#39;t want bitcoin wallet? or VLC(backdoored btw)? what if he just wants tor browser only? this helps reduce Whonix size and attack surface quite **alot**
 * Whonix gateway should automatically set up it&#39;s self without any user interaction, it should not even have a enviorment of any kind, user starts gateway then workstation thats it he dont setup gateway
* Whonix could have app run on first startup that change passwords from changeme to something long random and secure without telling the user it, this can be option from the app chooser app to preserve freedom but with big warning
* whonix live also based on alpine, with same exact setup except no apps but a preconfigured kvm whonix vms, encrypted host etc


i can be maintainer for future whonix 2.0 which i can start work on from now if you agree with my point

it can be provided in download page under some &quot;experimental Whonix 2.0&quot; or &quot;experimental live Whonix 2.0&quot; and dedicated forum section  

this is just thought, because current whonix state is sorry but i dont blame, if whonix do this it will be more secure than qube os and tails!</description>

<p>Good guidance. Way to much topics for 1 forum thread. And too much discussion, too little action.</p>
<p>To add to this:</p>
<p>The confrontational, revolutionary approach “let me tell you all the thing which are wrong and do as I say” most likely won’t work with any established projects.</p>
<p>What however does work is an incremental, evolutionary approach. A stream of small enhancement contributions. For example, recently there has been a number of security enhancements contributed to security-misc.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>“number of glaring security holes”, I waited 3 days to respond because of the title and the first line, but let’s try again.</p>
<p>The number of security holes are what can’t be done because of the lack of contributors, so instead of starting with security holes claim, start with the improvements you can make due to the Linux insecurities.</p>
<p>I recommend you start by reading this thread <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/fixing-the-desktop-linux-security-model/9172/2" class="inline-onebox">Fixing the Desktop Linux Security Model - #2 by madaidan</a></p>
<p>Also, if you want any of this to be done, start a thread per topic, use this thread as a meta thread to reference others, this way we can discern what is improving and what has not been developed yet.</p>
<p>Changing distro is probably the last thing to be done of these points because it is the most difficult, as it requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>changing from debian packaging to alpine packaging</li>
<li>less compatibility, have you tested the default desktop apps available by default on  Alpine?</li>
<li>updating the Wiki when related commands apt and dpkg should be changed accordingly to apk</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the above points, if you want Whonix on Alpine, then it should be the last thing to be done, as it is already much work on itself.</p>

<p>Doas does not work on most Linux distros, works only 100% on OpenBSD and FreeBSD and NetBSD with some modifications. But on Debian it does not work succesfully the persistent/timeout <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/opendoas#peristtimestamptimeout" class="inline-onebox">Debian / opendoas · GitLab</a></p>
<p>So if switching to Alpine, I assume this is not a problem either?</p>
<p>Anyway, doas does not ship with vidoas and doasedit, which are comparable to visudo and sudoedit, but this repo has that <a href="https://github.com/slicer69/doas" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - slicer69/doas: A port of OpenBSD's doas which runs on FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, and illumos</a> to help, an unnoficial port.</p>

<p>You must back up your claim if you want it to be really considered.<br>
Does Alpine have onionized repositories?<br>
Does Alpine have a way to deal with onionnized repositories safely like what is done with apt-transport-tor, that blocks not tor connections if attempting to reach onion repos and it is prefixed with <code>tor+REPO</code> in the sources list?</p>

<p>Base problem again, we can’t rebuild revery package to use musl, it needs to come from the base distribution.</p>

<p>Plenty, what does that mean? Does that mean it has everything to build Whonix? IDK, you are making that claim and should test building whonix applications on alpine.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>For servers, containers and very recently for desktop, but you didn’t mention that. Also is present in most VPS and has decades of existence and many forks. It is very amateurs on the desktop and has a very small userbase, try searching for help for Debian compared to Alpine. Whonix forums can’t answer everything and sometimes we have to let the users debug by using search engines, this is not gonna be a reality if Alpine help is difficult to find.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Technical challenges, debian default install does has that either, only choose your Desktop Environment and your enabled servers such as SSH. If that is done, an image is not ready when shipped. I don’t use most apps, and not on the same VM, but Whonix tries to ship applications by default.</p>
<p>About “VLC backdoor”, already replied by adrelanos.</p>
<p>About the difficulty of this issue, you will need to learn to build Whonix to test that.</p>

<p>Strongly disagree, if connection wizard is important to setup bridges, proxy etc, before tor connection start. There is a whole design for this to not be simply connecting directly in the first boot, but setting up the connection. Tails also has this setup.</p>

<p>Unlike any debian distro ever? Setting random password? How is the user gonna do privileged actions? Even if the password is shown in the first boot, the user should choose the password, not be randomly generated. If they want that, they can do via pasting a password manager password.</p>

<p>Same as replied above about Alpine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, start with small tasks, without accusations, with questions, presenting source to backup claim. Read other threads, most of the things you said were already discussed before and have problem which are obstacles that maybe you could overcome.</p>
<p>Security is not black and white.<br>
Less code does not mean better code.<br>
Less code does not mean better security.<br>
Less code does not mean better auditability.<br>
Those things are probably said in line of: “this code is more secure because it has less lines therefore it is easier to audit and more secure”.</p>

<p>BSDs are also minimal, but is enough people auditing them for bugs to be discovered? Using your arguments, Netflix uses FreeBSD, does it make a good choice of distro? If the distro is so minimal that people does not give attention to it, it is not audited enough at all.</p>

<p>This is incomparable.<br>
Qubes is a Xen hypervisor, Whonix can run on Qubes. Two very very different things.<br>
Tails is dedicated for amnesiac purposed, it’s tor implementation is prone to leaks through transpoxy and running tor on the same machine is already less secure than Whonix.</p>

<p>That’s a huge release.</p>
<p>The burden of proof is on the one making the claim. So before adding it to the wiki, we need much more specific evidence and cannot just write “somewhere in vault 7 go look for a torrent somewhere”.</p>
<p>Also VLC backdoor. Perhaps a vulnerability? Backdoor is a big word. I think if there would have been a backdoor in VLC, that would have been in mainstream news as well as that backdoor would have been analyzed by the security community who would have jumped onto it. Would be easily found on search engines.</p>

Vault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, detailing the activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare.

<p>the wiki does not mention vlc but the paper did, idont have direct download for vault 7 but im sure a quick search will give u some good torrents for download</p>
<p>(im not making claims its in the document also i dont think if something like vlc is backdoored by cia u would be able to “trivially find it via search engines” but thats just my only claim lol)</p>

<p>For making huge negative claims such as xxx is backdoored if it’s not a well known fact that can be trivially verified with search engines, it always helps to add weblinks to authoritative sources (research papers, news reports, originals) as well as a short specific citations which is making that point.</p>

            <p>it might also be worth creating a whonix wiki page related to vlc and including info about fact a backdoor was mentioned in cia vault 7 leak</p>
<p>(ignoring fact it is included by default in whonix hmm)</p>
<p>also stating that a video player is not needed and users should use tor browser as video player might also be worth mentioning or just removing vlc all together from default builds and if someone wants vlc he can install it normally via terminal</p>

            <p>I actually don’t agree to that either. Signing the hash, perhaps but that’s getting into semantics.

<p>There will probably be way too many disagreements that I can foresee. Therefore I think your conditions cannot be met.</p>
<p>In case that isn’t an issue… Due to the huge extend of changes you’re suggesting it would be helpful if you’d establish a history as a contributor first. As mentioned, for the wiki improving <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Operating_System#Criteria_for_Choosing_a_Base_Distribution">Criteria for Choosing a Base Distribution</a> would be good or a small non-controversial code contribution, bugfix, patch, feature.</p>
<p>Otherwise I think this forum thread has a high chance to result in a lot of discussion but no actual improvements.</p>

<p>the gpg when signing files signs only the hash, not the file, this is true to all ciphers curves and rsa. u cannot sign a file large than key size for example 4096 key can only sign 4096 big files max</p>
<p>“(GPG) digital signatures combine a hash with a cryptographic process which ensures not only the integrity of the signed message (file, mail, …) but also the authenticity of this message. By mean of these digital signatures (usually asymmetric cryptography), you can be sure that the content you checked has not been tampered with and has been issued by the owner of the key (who has access to the private key).”</p>

<p>No need to be an expert. Easy and actionable is raising the topic upstream and at TUF</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>speaking of tuf, i’d like give some more information on apk (alpine package manager)</p>
<p>it seems to download .tar and checks file hash from database of latest files hashes which is signed by pgp</p>
<p>so downloads content can’t be tampered with, as for mitm, alpine provides mirrors with https support,</p>
<p>which means man in middle can’t modify modify (they alrdy can’t but extra layer good), they can’t give user different package due https or make them download outdated package.</p>
<p>this is of course considering the mirror it’s self is not malicious. if it was malicious, and the attacker gives different package or old package version, apk will attempt to check if hash matches list of hashes signed and fail since hash lists always have latest versions (hash lists while provided by same supposed malicious mirror, it is signed with latest hashes so mirror cannot modify, unless mirror had already saved the last signed hash lists but im not sure what will happen in that sceniro)</p>
<p>so this rules out 2 attacks from tuf, the modification of content and to some degree, downgrade packages, which leaves re-direction to another package, alpine linux will prompt you with package names before you hit y, so if user installs firefox and he gets vlc, he will have had to manually agree to installation, if he did miss the vlc name in terminal, he would find out he got attacked because he dont have firefox!</p>
<p>as for dependencies, i have no clue.</p>
<p>what i just said is not facts on stone, maybe i got alot of things wrong but so far apk seems just as good as pacman and maybe even apt</p>

<h3><a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/propose-building-off-alpine-linux/107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Propose building off Alpine Linux</a></h3>

  <p>Hello, I was reading the Whonix.org page where it details pros/cons of building off different operating systems, but the Alpine Linux section seems to be from 2015. I think Kicksecure’s goal of providing a secure OS by default would work really well...</p>
