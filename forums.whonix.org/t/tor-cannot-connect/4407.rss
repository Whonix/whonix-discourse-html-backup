    <description> (Sorry if category is wrong)
Ive downloaded and installed Whonix Gateway on VirtualBox, everything seems to be fine at start, but TOR was unable to cinnect, its stuck at 5% &quot;Because of timeout&quot;. Some Idead? Soeone know how to fix it? Im sure you need more info, but I&#39; m not sure what info, so just ask mr question, I&#39;ll be also glad to send screenshots, if needed. TOR isn&#39;t blocked in my country, outside of Whonix it work perfect.</description>
