    <title>Where to download *.ova for Win separately without installer?</title>

    <description>Hello!
Since you  introduced the single Whonix installer file for Windows, there  seems no way to download ova files for Gateway and Workstation separately  as  it was before.
In my Windows system the installer  doesn&#39;t work properly. I.e  I start installation, Whonix  installer sets up to a folder, creates  its version of Virtualbox (or replaces the existing  VBox). But when I try to launch &quot;start whonix&quot; after the installation  is  completed, nothing  happens.  By clocking &quot;advanced&quot; there runs VirtualBox with empty list of OS images.
I don&#39;t see  ova files  in my Whonix folder, where I can download and verify them manually for  WIndows?</description>

            <p>you should be able to use the ova files for download here. <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox#Landing" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox#Landing</a></p>
<p>use “For Linux and Mac, see below” section. the fact that you are not using linux or mac should not matter.</p>

            <p>HI <code>Al_anonim</code></p>
<p>You can download the Gateway and Workstation images here:</p>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox#Landing">https://whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox#Landing</a></p>
<p>As the VirtualBox images are the same for all operating systems the instructions on the page should work for you just fine.</p>
