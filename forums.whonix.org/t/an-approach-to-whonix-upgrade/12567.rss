    <title>An approach to Whonix upgrade</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/an-approach-to-whonix-upgrade/12567</link>
    <description>Hello. Can I only upgrade Whonix Gateway VM to version 16 but leave the old Whonix Workstation? As far as I heard, Gateway is a key VM in Whonix project so it is important to keep Gateway up-to-date but as for Workstation, you can use any OS you like with Gateway so an upgrade for Workstation VM is not so important as upgrading Gateway.</description>
