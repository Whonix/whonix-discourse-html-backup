    <title>Login screen after Physical Isolation build on KVM</title>

    <description>This is more a how-not-to-do-it than a Whonix issue  ;)

Just finished a WS Physical Isolation build on a 4 GB image... the vm started complaining that only 68 MB space are left, so after a full start I decided to shut down and resize the image. Shutting down was not so easy, the vm kept hanging so I shut down via the vmm button.
After adding a few GB and resizing with gparted the vm started nicely but gave me a graphical login, that refused the user user (why?). I rebooted, ctrl-c, whonixsetup and whonixcheck ok, but still no login possible...  :-\</description>

Right. In my case I need a fix size.

Yep. The best tutorial^^ here:

Don't miss his copyright note ;)
If you are using a kvm vm image you can skip the convert steps.
<p>In order to adjust the partition size inside the vm image just download the gparted live image and add it as cdrom to the vm. Don’t forget the boot order.</p>
