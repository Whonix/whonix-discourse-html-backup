    <title>Cannot find qcow2 image file</title>

    <description>Hi there. I&#39;m new to Whonix and have studied lots of related materials about it. However, I still have encountered a problem when I try to use it on my laptop computer. What I&#39;m trying to do is to run Whonix (13.0.0.1.4) on my host system, Linux Mint 18,  with QEMU/KVM. And I followed the tutorial (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM), did exactly everything it instructs without any error message. But when I try to boot Whonix-Gateway from virt-manager, an error occurs with the this message : 
Cannot access storage file &#39;/var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Gateway.qcow2&#39; (as uid:124, gid:133): No such file or directory
I&#39;ve checked out /var/lib/libvirt/images, it is really an empty directory. I don&#39;t understand why there&#39;s no image file since I have not tried to move it to anywhere. Can anyone give me clue about what is going on and how can I fix it ? Thanks a lot.</description>

            <p>Assuming you extracted the images in the home folder please follow the steps here: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Moving_Whonix_Image_Files">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Moving_Whonix_Image_Files</a></p>
<p>to transfer them into the libvirt directory so KVM can boot from them.</p>

            <p>How do we do this? The files that were extracted are actually in the same folder where the xz files are. I don’t understand what you mean by moving to the image folder.</p>

            <p>I get the same error.</p>
<p>Can you try importing the files with the GUI and tell us what the results are? (Use the qcow2 files as disk image)</p>
<p>I tried it and then Tor doesn’t work in Gateway.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for trying Whonix KVM.</p>
<p>You must move the unarchived qcow2 image into the libvirt images folder. Make sure you do this step as root because its a privileged directory.</p>
