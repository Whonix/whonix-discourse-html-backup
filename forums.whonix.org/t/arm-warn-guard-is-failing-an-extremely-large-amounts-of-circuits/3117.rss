    <description>Few weeks ago my connections to other PC started to drop abruptly. I looked into ARM and see this :

*TIME* [WARN] Your Guard ---- ($****) is failing an extremely large amounts of circuits. This could indicate a route manipulation attack, extreme network overload or a bug. Success counts are ---. Use counts are ---. --- circuits completed. --- were unusable, --- collapsed and --- timed out. For reference, your timeout cutoff is 60 seconds.

could it be attack on me ?
