    <title>Function and meaning of the different Whonix VM&#39;s</title>

    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;ve been messing around with Qubes for a week now. Before even touching it i&#39;ve read all the documentation on Qubes and this also includes Whonix. I&#39;ve been reading over the documentation again for this problem but i just straight up couldn&#39;t find my answer even after talking to several people who know a little bit more about this then me. 

Now either im to stupid to breathe or i really have no clue what the function of some of the Whonix VM&#39;s on my qubes system are. I&#39;ll try to explain my problem as best i can.

I installed Qubes a while ago, took me a few days to even install it but hey, i managed to get it working. Qubes came with 4 VM&#39;s with Whonix in their name pre-installed. 

- Sys-Whonix
- Whonix-gw
- Whonix-ws
- Anon-whonix

Sys-whonix is the one that auto boots on startup. it even displays me a nice little message after a while saying: Connected to Tor. So i think, Perfect. Nothing for me to do, right. 

My problem is this: Sys-whonix is the only one that auto boots so i believe the whonix-gw and whonix-ws are not necessary for the sys-whonix to function the way it does? after all, it displays me a nice message saying connected to TOR just by starting up the sys-whonix one. 

I know the anon-whonix is used for actually browsing. 

But what the hell is the function of the whonix-gw and whonix-ws then? for what function will you have to boot them up ? i&#39;m sorry for asking this because i am almost a 100% sure the answer is right before my nose but i am probably lost in all the information. 

Can someone enlighten me ?</description>

            <p>Thanks a lot Hexagon,</p>
<p>Been struggling with this for a while now. I think what made me doubt myself was the names of the VM’s</p>
<p>Anon-Whonix is a Workstation but Whonix-ws is the template workstation. that’s probably what caused the confusion.</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, If anyone else has some input on this let me know <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>correct.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, using TemplateVMs for anything else than updating, changing settings, etc. would even be less secure: if your TemplateVM gets infected other VMs depending on that template would get infected as well.</p>

            <p>Hey Hexagon, First of all Thanks for the answer.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install</a><br>
Whonix-gw = TemplateVM for the Whonix gateway<br>
Whonix-ws = TemplateVM for the Whonix workstation<br>
Sys-Whonix = ProxyVM based on Whonix-gw<br>
Anon-Whonix = AppVM based on Whonix-ws</p>
<p>The TemplateVMs (Whonix-gw and Whonix-ws) have to be used if you want to install updates: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Update" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Update</a></p>
<p>It’s been a while since I used Qubes though, so there might be more i forgot.</p>
