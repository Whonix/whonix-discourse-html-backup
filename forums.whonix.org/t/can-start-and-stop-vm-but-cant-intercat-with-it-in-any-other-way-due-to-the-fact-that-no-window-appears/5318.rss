    <description>I&#39;ve followed the official [Whonix KVM guide](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM). I&#39;m now at the step where I should start the VMs. I can start them both with the GUI and the CLI without error messages. I can see that they are running, but I&#39;m not able to interact with them because no screen appears(I expected that a screen would appear like the one from qemu(without kvm)).
So I can launch it and kill it but nothing else.
The preferences shown by virt-manager for Whonix-Gateway say under Install Graphics &quot;VNC&quot;.
The host operating systems is Trisquel 7.0 GNU/Linux.</description>

            <p>I installed the package and now I am able to open the VM’s console.<br>
I should have read my distro’s documentation on the topic.<br>
Thanks. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Going by what your ditro’s install info page says I would try installing this package on the host:</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install python-spice-client-gtk</p>
<p><a href="https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/virtualization-using-kvm" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/virtualization-using-kvm</a></p>
<p>Also make sure you set your video to QXL instead of VGA in your VM. device settings.</p>

            <p>I forgot to say the version of Whonix: 13.0.0.1.4<br>
Shouldn’t spice be the default if it’s better?<br>
I changed it to spice and installed whatever package in my repository seemed to be needed:<br>
gir1.2-spice-client-gtk-3.0; gir1.2-spice-client-glib-2.0; gir1.2-spice-client-gtk-3.0; libspice-client-glib-2.0-8; libspice-client-gtk-3.0-4; libusbredirhost1; spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper; libspice-client-gtk-2.0-4; gir1.2-spice-client-gtk-2.0; spice-client-gtk</p>
<p>Some of them were dependencies.<br>
The problem remains.</p>
<p>Under hardware at Display Spice I see:<br>
Type - Spice<br>
Address - 127.0.0.1<br>
Port - Automatically allocated<br>
TLS Port - [Same as above]<br>
Password - [Empty]<br>
Keymap - Auto</p>
<p>Under Hardware details at Video QXL I see:<br>
Model - QXL<br>
RAM - 250MB<br>
Heads - 1</p>
<p>I went to View &gt; Console and when I launched the VM it said:<br>
“Cannot display graphical console type 'spice:<br>
No module named SpiceClientGtk”</p>
<p>I’m not really sure what to install. The ones I have installed have very similar names. I’m going to keep looking into the repository.</p>

            <p>Please select spice for graphics because this is what the VMs are configured to use. Its both faster and safer than VNC.</p>
