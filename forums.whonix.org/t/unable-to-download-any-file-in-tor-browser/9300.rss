    <title>Unable to download any file in Tor Browser</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/unable-to-download-any-file-in-tor-browser/9300</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m hoping someone can help with an ongoing issue I&#39;ve been having, trying to download files (any files) using Tor Browser within Whonix.

Whonix is my second Debian based distro in which downloading issues have occurred.
I am currently running Whonix through VirtualBox on a Windows 10 host.

Almost everything works as it should. Tor Browser launches just fine, connects to the servers, I&#39;m able to browse websites, etc. But when I click a &quot;download&quot; button or right click a link to &quot;save as&quot;, the normal prompt to choose a download location pops up, followed by an error message. 

For instance, when I attempt to download a new version of Tor Browser from the Tor Browser website, this is what pops up:

----

/tmp/mozilla_user0/XTuQomuj.xz.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.
Try again later, or contact the server administrator.

----

I have no problem downloading files in Tor Browser when it&#39;s running on the host machine (Windows 10).
Also, I have no problem downloading files within a Debian guest if I use the standard Firefox browser without any Tor connection.

In case it helps, here is the error I get when attempting to update Tor using the Whonix terminal:

----

(Debugging information: curl_status_message: [18] - [Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.])&#39;
+++ &#39;[&#39; &#39;!&#39; &#39;Failed to download: .../torbrowser/9.0.9/tor-browser-linux64-9.0.9_en-US.tar.xz

Possible reasons:

- The download server is down.
- File size exceeded (endless data attack triggered).
- Tor Browser Downloader (by Whonix developers) has been broken due to upstream changes.

----

Thanks in advance for any tips or recommendations!</description>

<p>Please don’t write Tor when you mean Tor Browser since this will cause confusion.</p>
