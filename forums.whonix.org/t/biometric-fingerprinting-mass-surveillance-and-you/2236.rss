A very much needed project would be to write a program that mimics the functionality of the this add-on but on the OS level.</description>

            <p>Anyhow. Both attempts above (VNC; TBB) are either the wrong level to fix it or awful workarounds. Let’s see if <a href="https://phabricator.whonix.org/T542">https://phabricator.whonix.org/T542</a> will fix it.</p>

            <p>Tested TBB 6.5a3-hardened. Does not defeat keystroke fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Tested without a connecting through a sheath, authenticated Tor Hidden Service VNC. That would be Tor over Tor. And not a useful test.</p>
<ul>
<li>either it should be defeated by Tor Hidden Service VNC: no, it’s not</li>
<li>or by TBB: no, it’s not as of TBB 6.5a3-hardened</li>

<p>Not a VPS. Just a server in my LAN.</p>

            <p>If that was to work, we could have some instructions on how one can VNC to its own locally running VNC server over Tor. I am very skeptic though, this does not actually open up more issues than it fixes. If it fixes any issues at all.</p>

<p>What does 13 % mean? At the moment not much, because someone else typing 10 fingers would have to input this and then see if they are also detected to be “13 %” of me.</p>
<p>Anyone up to test that?</p>
<ul>
<li>go to <a href="https://www.keytrac.net/en/tryout/authenticate">https://www.keytrac.net/en/tryout/authenticate</a>
</li>
<li>the user name / password entry is just to record / detect your typing pattern</li>
<li><code>adrelanos</code></li>
<li><code>mytestpw</code></li>
<li>(used a super simple pw to stress the test under hard conditions)</li>

            <blockquote>
<p>When someone is using ssh / vnc, one is specifically vulnerable (and ignorant) about keystroke fingerprinting, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any way to work around the keystroke fingerprinting? ssh / vnc to server one, and from there ssh / vnc to server two perhaps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think so because the connection from servers 1 to 2 will receive them in time delayed order they were sent.</p>
<p>Some options:</p>
<p>*Never sending anything except over authenticated HSs. Thats a good idea for many reasons because exposed VNC/SSH services are large security holes. Tor’s encryption/anonymity properties should conceal the size and timing of keystrokes sent.</p>
<p>*In the case of SSH described in the paper (Spoofing key-press latencies with a generative keystroke dynamics model) this applies when interactive mode is enabled so an easy but limiting workaround is to disable it. VNC needs realtime interaction or else it would be terribly laggy and unusable.</p>
<p>*The proposed anti-keystroke tool should help wit all these usecases even if the communication is sniffed and without disabling functionality.</p>
