    <title>Issue after upgrading Virtual Box</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/issue-after-upgrading-virtual-box/8278</link>
    <description>After upgrading VB to 6.0.12 I started experiencing an issue: When workstation starts the whisker menu disappears, you can click on icons but nothing happens, except PGP clipboard and some other applications. This never happened on 6.0.10.

The gateway on the other hand runs normally. Anyone know what this is?

Edit: Problem fixed</description>

            <p>I want to add this happened before, if I changed graphics controller from VBoxVGA with 3D acceleration to anything else. This was when I still had a dedicated GPU. But now that I run on integrated graphics this issue happens all the time.</p>
