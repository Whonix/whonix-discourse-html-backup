    <description>I am currently dealing with hardware issues. (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qubes-users/FLWtkn8hE2Y)

Until then, best way to get fast responses by me is the forum since I haven&#39;t set up a new mail client VM yet. Any actual testing, fixes, development has to wait until my setup is functional again.

Your mails and requests end up in the backlog of my mailbox and I&#39;ll deal with it once I get to it.</description>
