    <title>Need to use a proxy to connect to tor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/need-to-use-a-proxy-to-connect-to-tor/4346</link>
    <description>I already asked that here before and using the torrc directive doesn&#39;t work. Is it possible to make a ProxyVM which will transparently route everything from a vm that&#39;s connected to it using a remote ssh server? I want to chain sys-whonix to it.</description>

<p>Possible, quite likely. Documented (or likely being documented anytime<br>
soon), no since it requires non-trivial development work.</p>
