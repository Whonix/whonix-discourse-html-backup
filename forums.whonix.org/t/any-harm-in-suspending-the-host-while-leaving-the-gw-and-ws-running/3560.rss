    <title>Any harm in suspending the host while leaving the GW and WS running?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/any-harm-in-suspending-the-host-while-leaving-the-gw-and-ws-running/3560</link>
    <description>I usually just suspend my host and leave the gateway and workstation as they were, running on the host.
After waking up, I restart the Gateway, and use the &quot;Restart swdate - instantly adjust the time&quot; on the Workstation.
Any harm to my OPSEC?

(BTW if the gateway is not restarted then the workstation loses connection after about 10 minutes, but it works until then)</description>

            <p>Shouldn’t be. If you are using KVM then the GW timer should be updated with the host’s. For the workstation you should run sdwdate manually before browsing again.</p>
