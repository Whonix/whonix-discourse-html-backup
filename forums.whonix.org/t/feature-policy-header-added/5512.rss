    <title>Feature-Policy header added</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/feature-policy-header-added/5512</link>
    <description>Continuing on my recent security header binge (CSP, Expect-CT, Referrer-Policy), we&#39;ve added the new &#39;Feature-Policy&#39; header to the Whonix infrastructure.

Feature-Policy is a new header which allows us to set, server-side, whether the site can implement features of the browser/client app such as &#39;vibrate&#39;, &#39;microphone&#39;, &#39;camera&#39;, &#39;notifications&#39;, &#39;full screen&#39; etc.

In other words, some of those privacy settings you&#39;d normally configure in your browser such as mic, camera, midi, etc, can now be set server-side, meaning less chance of a &#39;downgrade&#39; attack on the end user to enable unwanted and/or privacy-impacting &#39;features&#39; of the browser if the server is not compromised and says no.

Ideally everyone is already compartmentalising devices etc with QubesOS but it&#39;s not a perfect world :slight_smile: 

Browsers are yet to fully implement the new header, but it&#39;s in place for when they do. We&#39;re a bit ahead of the curve.
