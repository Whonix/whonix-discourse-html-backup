    <description>Your choice of tcpserver for the ControlPort proxy filter was well thought out to as to be included in TAILS too.  :) When looking at the ticket and the referenced mailinglist discussion, I see that they&#39;ve taken extra steps to try and protect the filter from DoS and invalid input, for example limiting the characters allowed to 128 and using Tor&#39;s stem to further simplify the script. I don&#39;t know if you implemented this, but wanted to let you know how far thy went.

            <p>Maximum string length is a good idea. Thanks for suggesting this! Implemented:<br>

<p>Whonix-Gateway’s firewall will reject more invalid packages in Whonix 9. Adding DDOS protection to Whonix-Gateway from Whonix-Workstation’s could be considered in another post. I don’t know yet if that would be useful.</p>
<p>Using stem is not on the horizon yet, since I am not a python coder. For that reason, and because command wildcards are not supported yet, I wouldn’t mind a python rewrite by someone else, though.</p>
