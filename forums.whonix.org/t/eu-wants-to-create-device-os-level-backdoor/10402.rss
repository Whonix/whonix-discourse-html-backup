    <description>It seems that the EU, similarly to the US,  wants to backdoor e2ee communications  supposedly to protect the children, but  as we all know that&#39;s just a convenient excuse  to justify having access to images/videos and perhaps even text messages(depending on the chosen implementations). Given that several of the top proposals leaked to the Politico  would implemented on device/OS level,  and I believe whonix is based in Germany, I was wondering how the whonix project would respond to such legislation if it were to pass.</description>
