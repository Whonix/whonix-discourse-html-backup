    <title>Did I just burn myself</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/did-i-just-burn-myself/2558</link>
    <description>I use Whonix on my host machine and also on my dedicated server, on both earlier today I installed team viewer and connected from my host to the dedicated server.

Tonight i&#39;ve just found out team viewer uses udp.

What information would have leaked when I did this? Is this server now burned? Thankfully I was just in the process of setting it up so I have nothing on it.</description>

<p>It depends on the program. Determined programs like Skype and Teamviewer will use a different protocol to get out. Others, like some VOIP/SIP apps, will fail.</p>

            <p>Thank you, so I need to learn how to write better questions noted.</p>
<p>What concerns me or maybe I just don’t understand it correctly is UDP, tor doesn’t support UDP so what happens when I run a program that uses it from my Whonix workstation? Should it just fail to connect? I’m at no risk of it leaking my i.p?</p>
<p>When I connected my two teamviewers both of which were located inside a Whonix workstation I read that tor doesn’t support UDP and assumed that as they had connected a leak of my i.p must have occurred.</p>
<p>I have since read the wiki about tunneling UDP at the time of me using the teamviewers I was ignorant regarding tor not supporting UDP.</p>

            <p>When I see Patrick post that I begin to worry,  I must state that both teamviewers were installed on the workstations and only ever connected to one another via the workstations.</p>
<p>So time to close that server and start with a new one and never touch tv again or am I going to be ok?</p>

<p>It can. But not when you route it over Tor, since Tor doesn’t support UDP.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Your TeamViewer connections (if they succeeded) were made using TCP. But even if Tor supported UDP, why would you think that UDP would be more prone to de-anonymization?</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of reasons not to use TeamViewer. It’s not mentioned in the wiki, but I can’t imagine TeamViewer would be ranked very high on the recommended list.</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses a proprietary, closed-source protocol.</li>
<li>It uses central servers to establish connections and/or to serve as proxies for your connections. When both ends use TeamViewer over Tor, they still maintain IP anonymity, but why involve a middle-man when you can connect directly? If the TeamViewer software has unique identifiers, then your activity will be pseudonymous.</li>
<li>Ambiguous security track record (including current events).</li>
</ol>
