    <title>What happened to the Guardianrom project?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/what-happened-to-the-guardianrom-project/1361</link>
    <description>Does anyone know what happened to the guardianrom project for android devices?
It was featured/promoted on the guardian project website and the developer was active on the wilder-security forum and xda-something forum, promoting the project and updating the development status. he even started a fundraiser campaign and then suddenly everything disappeared - he cancled the fundraiser campaign(s), the download-page disappered, the entry on the guardian-project website vanished and so on.

Does anyone know if there it is still possible to download a beta-version? 
Is anyone taking over the project? 
Are there any alternatives with similar features available? (especially a hidden os feature)</description>
