    <description>[quote=&quot;JasonJAyalaP, post:15, topic:140&quot;]Having two separate images might mean more work for the chooser, and in the case of a custom wallpaper, asking a contributor to do double work. Maybe it&#39;s not a big deal.

Alternatively, the gateway desktop could be the same as the workstation but black and white or inverted colors! Maybe not the most artistic choice, but users would be instantly alerted that &quot;this one is the different one you&#39;re not supposed to trust&quot;.

And that gateway notice message is just god-awful. :P[/quote]

Gateway notice message is god-awful, yes.

What is the worst case scenario here? User puts his sensitive docs on GW desktop? He downloads a browser? 

Notice is really out of place and with icons all over it makes it a very non-ideal way to send the message &quot;This is not WS. Be careful of what you do&quot;.

Can we restrict the user in some way? Change notice to pop-up when a certain action (sudo apt-get install?) is performed?

Probably not reasonable to have a separate package. Putting this into a general gateway-usablity package seems more appropriate.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Releases are infrequent. Last test release is 8.2, a maintenance/security release. Due to bigger usability bugs (torbrowser downloader broken), there have been two point releases after Whonix 8 (8.1 and soon 8.2) with perhaps 1 or 2 months in between? Other than that, Whonix 9 will take a while. If I am not mistaken, on average there were 6 months in between major releases.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Redistribution">http://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Redistribution</a> page is a bit simpler than it looks like. It targets a full blown release manager (someone who would stabilize releases and do everything I am doing currently to prepare releases).</p>
<ul>
<li>“Use a newer <a href="http://snapshot.debian.org">snapshot.debian.org</a> repository.” - don’t worry about that - that’s more a dev thing.</li>
<li>“Update Whonix debian package repository.” - same here.</li>
<li>" update download readme" - same here.</li>
<li>Same for pushing code to github.</li>
<li>Same for Whonix apt repository management.</li>
<li>Same for Whonix News.</li>
<li>Same for “Source Code”.</li>
<li>Same for Wiki Page Updates (perhaps except checking links for terminal-only updated builds).</li>
<li>“Announcement” - nevermind, I can do that in one go.</li>
</ul>
<p>./release/sign_images and ./release/upload_images, ./release/compress_qcow those are just helper scripts saving some typing. I can introduce you into those.</p>

How about two versions of the Gateway? One with no desktop would be for casual users, and users who want a small VM. The other with desktop would be for advanced users who want more configuration and testing options.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The would be a fine solution. We could introduce an “advanced options” link on the download page. The only thing preventing this solution is time / man power.</p>
<p>At the moment I am building, signing and uploading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE ova (+ me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE ova (+me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was to maintain a Whonix-Gateway terminal-only version, it would be me building, signing and uploading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE ova (+ me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway terminal only  ova (+ me testing) [X]</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE ova (+me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway terminal-only qcow2 (for KVM) [Y]</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>

I could do X and Y, I think. Building the workstation took about an hour, and it’s a dedicated building machine with task-specific SSDs.</p>
<p>How often do you typically update builds?</p>
<p>When I setup the build machine, I verified your gpg key’s fingerprint, and ran “git tag -v 8.1” to verify that. Then:</p>
<p>sudo ~/Whonix/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine<br>
several warnings about “possibly missing firmware” for Realtek NIC [gotta fix that]<br>
completed saying 'INFO: End of: /home/user/Whonix/build-steps.d/1100_prepare-build-machine<br>
No error detected. (benchmark: 01:09:16)'<br>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-gateway<br>
… No error detected. (benchmark: 00:00:01)<br>
sudo ~/Whonix/whonix_build --clean --tor-workstation<br>

<blockquote>[quote author=Patrick link=topic=207.msg1697#msg1697 date=1397950027]
- console window looks scary, targets more linux-console-type than causal user[/quote]
The fact that it "looks scary" may be a good thing, if it prevents casual users from messing with it ;)</blockquote>
It also scared potential users away from using it Whonix all.
<blockquote>[quote]- setting up bridges[/quote]
That's an advanced activity, no?</blockquote>
When you're in a censored country, it is no advanced activity at all. Without it = no activity at all.
<p>The current graphical desktop can be seen as a intermediate step in evolution of Whonix usability. The mid term plan is using tor-launcher addon as standalone xul on Whonix-Gateway (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Sponsor/A#Better_Circumvention_User_Interface">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Sponsor/A#Better_Circumvention_User_Interface</a>).</p>
<blockquote>Even without a desktop, I'm sure that something could be hacked with ASCII.</blockquote>
Apart from that, I would be happy to have a text version of a bridge wizard. There isn't one yet, because it is a challenge for me to create one and other tasks got into the way. Experiences by Vidalia and tor-launcher addon show, that a Tor connection / bridge wizard isn't a trivial thing.
<blockquote>[quote]- accessibility[/quote]
For whom? There are text-based readers, I suspect. What accessibility is the current setup providing?</blockquote>
- Magnifier.
- Virtual Keyboard.
- "KMouseTool clicks the mouse whenever the mouse cursor pauses briefly. It was designed to help those with repetitive strain injuries, for whom pressing buttons hurts."
<p>(Packages: kdeaccessibility, kvkbd, kmousetool, kmag, kmouth, jovie.)</p>
<p>In future, this will hopefully improve.</p>
<p>As for the text based readers, it seems like those are quite difficult to configure in a VM / text mode. Needs more research.</p>
<blockquote>[quote]- updating[/quote]
That could be scripted, and even automated.</blockquote>
Automatic updates would be a desirable features, there are challenges:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Automatic_Updates#Automatic_Updates
<blockquote>How about two versions of the Gateway? One with no desktop would be for casual users, and users who want a small VM. The other with desktop would be for advanced users who want more configuration and testing options.</blockquote>
The would be a fine solution. We could introduce an "advanced options" link on the download page. The only thing preventing this solution is time / man power.
<p>At the moment I am building, signing and uploading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE ova (+ me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE ova (+me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was to maintain a Whonix-Gateway terminal-only version, it would be me building, signing and uploading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix-Gateway KDE ova (+ me testing)</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway terminal only  ova (+ me testing) [X]</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE ova (+me testing)</li>

<li>Whonix-Gateway terminal-only qcow2 (for KVM) [Y]</li>
<li>Whonix-Workstation KDE qcow2 (for KVM)</li>

<p>Run ‘python first_use_notice.py’ or ‘./first_use_notice.py’ if you make it executable.<br>
Check ‘Do not show this message again’. Close the window.<br>
Run the script again, the message should not pop.</p>
<p>Thinking forward.</p>
<p>There might be a problem wit the text if the user’s system font is different from mine (text too small or outside the boundaries of the window). Should be tested by different users.</p>
<p>The window has to be open modal, so that it cannot be hidden beneath another one. Should be easy.</p>
<p>This script is versatile for fixed message. We can probably use a message box when there is no user input.</p>
<p>If we want to replace the timesync and whonixcheck popups (not a necessity, but…), as the text is variable, using a fixed size window (no alt+F4 to close it!) with a scroll bar could do the job.</p>
<p>A precision. This is my first ‘real world’ python script. The python tutorials I have tried just bother you with useless lists, tuples and other dictionaries.<br>
I have some experience in GUI (and a little more) programming with VisualStudio .net. The first impression here is that the syntax for objects and events handling is way simpler in python.</p>

Keep the text.</p>

Good. Getting the emotional component into it, probably your next solution seems more attractive.</li>

Use a solid color background instead of nice wallpaper, plus the text</p>

Replace text with big popup. No "don't show me" option.

Seems annoying. Still considering it.
<p>(VM suspend/awake isn’t recommended for Whonix-Gateway - confuses Tor due to slow clock.)</p>
<blockquote>Option 3:
Set Gateway default VirtualBox ram to 128
  - Most users, especially first time users, don't need to configure the gateway anyway.</blockquote>
- console window looks scary, targets more linux-console-type than causal user
- setting up bridges
- accessibility
- updating
- power of without typing "sudo poweroff" is bad, can lead to "strange" issues
- some stuff from https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Graphical_Whonix-Gateway.3F such as Whonix controller

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Option 1:<br>
Keep the text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users shouldn’t be enjoying the desktop image on the gateway anyway.</li>
<li>If users hate it that much, they can manually change it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 1b:<br>
Use a solid color background instead of nice wallpaper, plus the text</p>
<ul>
<li>The warning text won’t look as ugly</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 2:<br>
Replace text with big popup. No “don’t show me” option.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good enough until we get a GUI programmer.</li>
<li>“Don’t Show” isn’t a big deal. It’s supposed to be an annoyance. Doesn’t reappear after VM suspend/awake anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>Option 3:<br>
Set Gateway default VirtualBox ram to 128</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users, especially first time users, don’t need to configure the gateway anyway.</li>
<li>Saves RAM for most people</li>
<li>Discourages desktop use of gateway. Gateway boots to terminal saying “Go load up the workstation!”</li>
<li>Adjusting RAM is a “natural quiz”, making sure users have at least the minimal skill required to poke around in the gateway.</li>
<li>Probably the direction we’re going anyway once we get gateway specific console tools (ncurses HUD, etc) developed.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I see. Perhaps was a bad idea. An optional, voluntary security quiz however would might still be useful. But that’s another story and can be created when more important things are done.</p>

<p>Just click, click, download, install, not reading and then trying is quite common. The desktop text is so intrusive, that no one ever got it wrong again.</p>

            <blockquote>What about making a quiz?</blockquote>
<p>Please no. I want to use a piece of software not being quizzed about it’s inner workings. I can safely say I would never use that software again if the scenario you mentioned would occur.</p>
<p>I would like to move the discussion more into practical examples of what can go wrong.</p>

            <p>This is a good idea. Unfortunately, I have to learn python first because bash/zenity does not support “do not show this message again” check boxes. Or someone else has to implement this in meanwhile.</p>

            <p>What about a GUI notice, whonixcheck or timesync like, popping at the first run of the gateway, with a “Do not show this message at startup” checkbox?</p>

            <p>A prettier solution to communicate this would be much appreciated. In desperation to stop anyone confusing this, I cam up with this “let’s add it to the desktop wallpaper” solution.</p>
<p>Hooking attempts to run apt-get would work, but not having a browser pre-installed would still confuse too many users, which will then quickly discard the project as broken and give up.</p>
<p>What about making a quiz?</p>
<p>whonixsetup could explain what Whonix-Gateway is used for, then accept “ok” as only reply. After that, a question could be asked. Something like “What is Whonix-Gateway considered to be used for?” Menu:</p>
<p>“Dunno.” (default choice, goes back to info text)<br>
“I can start an anonymous browser here”. (tells the user this was wrong, goes back to info text)<br>
“I need to (download|install)(?) Whonix-Workstation or set up my own Custom-Workstation.” (proceeds)</p>
