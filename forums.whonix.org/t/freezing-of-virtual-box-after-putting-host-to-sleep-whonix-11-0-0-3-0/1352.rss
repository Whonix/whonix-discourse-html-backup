    <title>Freezing of virtual box after putting host to sleep (Whonix 11.0.0.3.0)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/freezing-of-virtual-box-after-putting-host-to-sleep-whonix-11-0-0-3-0/1352</link>
    <description>Already had some problem with Whonix 10 + putting host into sleepmode (https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,1503.0.html). And now having a some problems with Whonix 11.0.0.3.0. When recovering from sleepmode on my host, some times the Gateway (mostly) or the Workstation (once) is completely black and unresponsive.

The blackness seems to be a new Whonix 11 function when you don&#39;t use the Workstation/Gateway for a few minutes, normally when clicking the Workstation/Gateway it becomes active agian. However after the host recovers from sleepmode it some times freezes. 

On one occasion my Gateway had a (partial) kernel panic instead of a completely black screen:
Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.
Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.000 seconds) done.
Suspending console(s) (use no_console_suspend to debug)

Are these problems with sleepmode to be expected?</description>
