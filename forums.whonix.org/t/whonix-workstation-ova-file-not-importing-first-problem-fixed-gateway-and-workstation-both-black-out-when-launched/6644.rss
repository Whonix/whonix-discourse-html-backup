    <description>Hello, I have tried to import the Whonix Workstation OVA file into Virtual Box as instructed but it seems to not want to import. I&#39;m using Virtual Box 6.0.

            <p>Nevermind, it’s probably because you posted too many short messages?</p>
<p>Do you have enough RAM to run the VM? What if you wait a few minutes, does the VM start? Do you have the same problem with the Gateway VM?</p>

            <p>Really strange. As I told you, I did an import in VirtualBox 6 this morning in a Windows 10 machine and it went normally.</p>
<p>I see that your .ova file is on the F: disk? What kind of disk is that? Maybe try to put the ova file on C: disk, like in user’s documents folder… I really don’t know.</p>
<p>PS: glad that you solved the first error, I add it here as it may be useful for other people:</p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe import --vsys 0 --eula accept</code></p>

I am far from being a Windows expert (stopped using Windows a few years ago when I switched to Linux), but I think you have to indicate the whole path, so something like this:</p>

<p>I googled your error code and the cause can be many things. I have just imported the Workstation ova on a Windows 10 machine and had no problem.</p>
<p>Could you try from the command line it should give more details about the error:</p>
<p><code>VBoxManage import C:\path\to\your\file.ova</code><br>
