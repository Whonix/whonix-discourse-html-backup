    <title>security for anonymity for a beginner</title>

    <description>Hi all i have just downloaded whonix on my home computer and I would like to know if you could possibly help me with the following concerns which  I have. I have done both the work station and the gateway, done the sudo -i and the apt upgrade and the apt update also. I want to make sure I am secure so I would like to ask if you could help me with the following : 

Reading the whonix help pages My concerns lay in understanding what additional security measures i can take and if i am currently secure at all and how i can test whether i am secure. I feel a difference in IP isn&#39;t enough to be secure.i have heard of horror stories on Youtube of killer&#39;s and rapist&#39;s hacking computers and coming to the users home.

so I&#39;ve read about:
 
optional configurations&gt; what are these and how can they be of any benefit to security? also where can i find them on the whonix system

beware of man in the middle attacks &gt; from my understanding ssl certificates arn&#39;t enough so how can i make sure i&#39;m secure??

set directory guards &gt; where can i find these and how do i change them?

change password &gt; how do i do this? i&#39;m assuming this is the default &quot;changme&quot; password. how would i change this?

got this statement from the whonix security help pages

&quot;By default, protect you if Tor is somehow broken. You can improve that to some extent (with caveats) by chaining Tor with SSH, proxies or VPNs.&quot;

the above sounds technical is there a video guide step by step which i can follow?? or can someone explain in simple terms.

How do i hide that i am using Tor??

Thanx in advance for your help</description>

<p>It’s good that you read the documentation. I’d like to emphasize one section in particular: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot">Non-technical steps for staying anonymous</a>. More than anything else, following these tips while using Whonix will help keep you safe. If you read the news about people who have been de-anonymized in the past, it’s almost always due to these mis-steps.</p>
<p>“Secure” can be applied to many different aspects of your system. Too broad a topic to address unless you are willing to provide more detail on your specific concerns.</p>
<p>Whonix by default is configured with relatively safe settings. As a beginner, you’re likely to do more harm than good by tinkering. (Not trying to discourage you from testing, but make sure you do it on a separate clone VM used only for learning purposes).</p>

</aside>
<p>I know those to well, are however not based in reality, but rather creepy pastas and humorous fiction. Unless you see such information in a real newspaper/product of a serious journalist, it is most definitely false.</p>

<p>That part of the documentation essentially means that Whonix is compatible with all sorts of software, which may be installed over apt-get.</p>

</aside>
<p>As long as you access a hidden service, this won’t concern you, as eavesdropping isn’t possible then. When accessing a “normal” website over Tor, SSL actually is enough, as it renders this kind of attack impossible, by encrypting anything going over the connection.</p>

<p>Do you mean entry guard? Because doesn’t shouldn’t be manually set, that would make you by far more vulnerable, regard this: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit</a></p>

</aside>
<p>Sadly, due to differences between VPN providers, setup, etc. this can not be explained universally. Furthermore, keep in mind that, if you use a VPN/proxy/whatever instead of the normal exit node, the provider of that VPN, etc. can eavesdrop on you actually far more easily than a provider of an exit node.</p>
