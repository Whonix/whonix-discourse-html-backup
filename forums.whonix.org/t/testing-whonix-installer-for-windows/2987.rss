    <description>Comment: The following is a previously private discussion which was made public after the initial release of the Whonix-Installer and UI. 

Good day,

So as some of you may recall, about half a year ago, I tried to create a custom installer which was supposed to make starting out with Whonix easier for newcomers. Now, since then original thread for this project (https://forums.whonix.org/t/windows-installer/1909) hasn&#39;t really been updated that much to be honest. The reasons for this were plentiful, as well as (partially) not really in my control. Some where based in the initial choice of programing language, some where actually created by Oracle/VirtualBox, who without telling the community, quietly changed some aspects of their installer, making anything based on there software rather unpredictable, some actually on part of Microsoft and there incapability of fixing bugs in regards to msiexec, instead recommending some rather obscure ways arround the issues (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/heaths/2005/11/15/waiting-for-msiexec-exe-to-finish/) which sadly didn&#39;t work for me, some where rooted in the fact that Whonix sadly isn&#39;t the smallest thing in the world and thus a lot of tinkering was necessary as every free and open setup solution only supports up to 2GB in filesize, some where rooted in the fact that I really did want to minimize the input required by a user and also insisted on delivering the whole thing as one singular .exe which limited me in quite a few ways, some where rooted in the fact that making this project possible for users who already had VBox installed in some way create some massive issues, some in certain details regarding Whonix and VBox (the EULA for example made using VBoxManage for the import almost impossible, which lead me to thinking about actually creating and maintaining seperate images for this project...), some where rooted in the fact that a lot of private things happend in the background and one was rooted in the fact that I don&#39;t really have the most efficient work moral...

Long story short, it took quite a massive amount of experimentation (far more than I would have imagined for simply bundling a few installers, drivers, certificates, after-install-scripts and files together) but I&#39;ve finally been able to create the promised installer including all the features I intially proposed and then some.

&lt;strike&gt;You may find it once fully published here: https://github.com/EgoBits1/Whonix-Installer&lt;/strike&gt;

Github sadly timed out just before reaching the 3,5GB mark. Thus uploaded it to mega: https://mega.nz/#F!eIYkwTbS!GqcZkPlTlYoKJZk6WEGhWA

It would be great if one or two of you could perhaps test it before it gets deployed. The Github project also contains a signature and my public key for verification.

Now, here a list of what my solution is capable of:

* Let&#39;s user set install folder for everything in one go (including VBox, etc)
* Requires just three clicks to install everything (including importing and setting up WS and GW in VBox)
* Bundled into one single file
* Asks only once for UAC
* Very heavily compressed
* Comes with an easy to use uninstaller
* Bypass Oracles limitations in regards to where and how VBox may be installed
* Uninstaller removes everything (including VBox, the Whonix images created and imported by the installer and anything stored by the user) as good as is possible on Windows without overwriting hard drive multiple times
* Will be bundled with simple user interface allowing easy launch of GW and WS (to be finished (Placeholder is included as &quot;whonix.exe&quot; to test start menu inclusion)
* Works on both x64 and x86 and selects correct version of VBox, etc without needing user input
* Is easily &quot;adaptable&quot; for when Whonix 14 is finished
* Bypasses 2GB size limit imposed by &quot;nullsoft scriptable install system&quot;
* Includes a very basic &quot;bin file checksum verifier&quot;
* Based soly on free software (NSIS is under zlib/libpng and 7zip uses GPL)
* Existing installations of VirtualBox are automatically upgraded to the version included and existing images/virtual hard drives are in no way compromissed/modified/removed even when the user changes the install folder for VBox

Now, like mentioned before, it would be great if one of you (or more) could perhaps test this installer before we deploy it so any more problematic bugs can be found.

Furthermore, there are two &quot;features&quot; I&#39;m still thinking about including.

First of all, though this isn&#39;t really a feature, I&#39;m thinking about changing/improving the design of the installer. This is what currently is being used:

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/3328bdb8da0435a42a3717dbc1d4a1e8b15ab9bc.PNG&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;474&quot;&gt;

While it is functional, it is also very basic.

Something like this might improve matters a bit:

&lt;img src=&#39;/uploads/default/original/1X/4a10bf7e484b43ae854c516f25afbc05b5bc8978.png&#39;&gt;

Secondly, I had the idea of maybe creating an automated verification process which would make manually verifing the images not necessary anymore. However the question would be how such a thing could be implemented properly. If an attacker has the ability to modify the images, than modifying the keys would also be possible. They&#39;d have to be delivered seperatley from a server, though how can one prevent an attacker from rerouting the query to said server? Anyways, as mentioned before there is a basic integrity check already though I wouldn&#39;t trust it to much.

Also, I&#39;m still attempting to automate the import of the necessary certificates by Oracle. Sadly the only way I could find requires additional software by Microsoft which due to licensing I am unable to bundle with this installer.

Adding to that, the command prompts while extracting and importing the gateway and workstation files are just temporary, mainly so I am able to monitor whether something actually happens during that time. I had spent so long looking for an error when in reality certain commands weren&#39;t even executed that I found that to be a necessity. Whether these should actually be removed remains to be decided as an argument could be made that users should be able to observe the installation process as detailed as possible.

Anyways, I hope that what I&#39;ve created works properly and if you have any suggestions on what could be added/changed/improved, just let me know. I didn&#39;t want to post this publicly as any obvious issues should probably be found before deploying this...

Have a nice day,

Ego

P.S.: On certain systems, it takes a bit of time to start. Not sure whether my hard drive is at fault or whether my SFX is simply compressed with an ineffizient format.

    I didn’t know if I should post in the development sub-forum or here, so I thought I would ask here first. 
I was randomly googling around the internet for nsisbi and I found whonix used to use nsisbi in the past (don’t know if you still use it now or not). 
I am the sole developer of nsisbi and I just wanted some feedback on your experience with it. What worked, what needed modifying, any bugs you found, maybe even some questions you have and I can try to answer them. 
Thanks, Jason.

<p>Alright. Pointed that out and extended that chapter just now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_Whonix_Windows_Installer#Software_Digital_Signature_Verification_Tools_Installation"> Software Digital Signature Verification Tools Installation</a></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Software Digital Signature Verification Tools Installation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Due to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verifying_Software_Signatures#Conceptual_Challenges_in_Digital_Signatures_Verification">Conceptual Challenges in Digital Signatures Verification</a> and <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Hosts#Windows_Software_Sources">impracticality, unpopularity of digital software signature verification on the Windows platform</a>, this is a cumbersome process. None of these issues are specific to Whonix ™ to caused by Whonix ™. <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_Whonix_Windows_Installer#cite_note-3">[3]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To keep a system secure and free of malware it is strongly recommended to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Warning#Always_Verify_Signatures">always verify software signatures</a>. However, this is very difficult, if not impossible for Windows users. Most often, Windows programs do not have software signature files (OpenPGP / gpg signatures) that are normally provided by software engineers in the GNU/Linux world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most other vendors of software on the Windows platform are either unaware or ignore this issue. The Whonix ™ project makes an effort to document and cope up with the mess on the Windows platform.</p>
<p>This page includes documentation on how to securely acquire Gpg4win - an application which can be used to verify digital software signatures provided by the Whonix ™ project and other software.</p>
<p>Option A) The following guide provides steps to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and installation of SignTool.</li>
<li>Download Gpg4win.</li>
<li>Verify Gpg4win using SignTool.</li>
<li>Import the developer’s GPG signing key into Gpg4win.</li>
<li>Verify the Whonix ™ Windows Installer using Gpg4win.</li>
</ol>
<p>SignTool is a Windows platform focused tool provided by Microsoft which can be used to verify software digital signatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://gnupg.org/">[archive]</a> is a complete and free implementation <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OpenPGP">OpenPGP</a> that allows users to encrypt and sign data and communications. Popular on Windows, macOS and Linux platform. <a href="http://www.gpg4win.org/">Gpg4win</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.gpg4win.org/">[archive]</a> is a graphical front end for GnuPG that is used to for file and email encryption in Windows. The verification process for the Whonix ™ Windows Installer includes securely downloading an verifying the <code>gpg4win</code> package. Once completed GPG can be used from the command-line to verify the Whonix ™ Windows Installer.</p>
<p>Download and installation of SignTool (from the Microsoft website over TLS) and verification of Gpg4win using SignTool might be considered optional. This is because both, SignTool and Gpg4win (downloaded from the Gpg4win website over TLS) are only downloaded over <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SSL">TLS</a>, a very basic form of authentication. The argument for that is debatable. “It would be much more unlikely for a massive company like Microsoft to be compromised and serve malicious software than gpg4win server.” <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_Whonix_Windows_Installer#cite_note-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Option B) Therefore optionally the user might decide to skip the SignTool step and simplify as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Gpg4win.</li>
<li>Import the developer’s GPG signing key into Gpg4win.</li>
<li>Verify the Whonix ™ Windows Installer using Gpg4win.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gpg4win documentation also covers subject.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gpg4win.org/package-integrity.html">Check integrity of Gpg4win packages - Gpg4win website</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.gpg4win.org/package-integrity.html">[archive]</a>
</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>This is being stated to avoid Whonix ™ of getting blamed for this mess. Previously users put it this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never had to verify any software. Why Whonix makes this more complicated than everyone else?</p>

<p>gpg4win website nowdays has a valid, CA signed TLS certificate / functional https. Therefore chapter for manual TLS certificate installation remove.d</p>
<p>Is there still any point of downloading SignTools from <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a> to use it to verify gpg4win? Connecting to <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a> over TLS only vs connecting to <a href="http://gpg4win.org">gpg4win.org</a> over TLS only seems to be equally dangerous. There seems to be a bootstrapping problem of securely obtaining gpg4win on the Windows platform anyhow.</p>
<p>Or is initially downloading SignTools (which then will be used to verify gpg4win) from <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a> more secure because <a href="http://microsoft.com">microsoft.com</a> is on the TLS Static Public Key Pinning list?</p>
<p>TLS Public Key Pinning (HPKP) was deprecated but does TLS Static Public Key Pinning still exist?</p>

<p>Can anyone find a TLS Static Public Key Pinning list?</p>
<p>However, I doubt it. <code>curl --head https://www.microsoft.com</code> does not even include a HSTS header.</p>

            <p>Will be updating the following wiki pages to reflect the latest Whonix release,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Quick_Start">https://whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Quick_Start</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Also updating (pull requests) where needed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-UI">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-UI</a></li>

<p>Should we also have a separate wiki page (For Testers)?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Quick_Start">https://whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Quick_Start</a></li>

            <p>If anyone is having issues with the Whonix installer you will likely receive a faster response by asking your question on the Whonix forum as opposed to emailing myself or Whonix developers directly.</p>
<p>I don’t mind answering questions via email, but when questions are asked in the Whonix public forums, all community members can benefit from the answers provided by the Whonix team and greater community.</p>

<p>I’ve had this same issue when running the <code>Whonix Installer</code>.</p>

<p>Downloaded and installed from <a href="http://Whonix.org">Whonix.org</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First time extracting had an error. My guess would be Norton antivirus or Windows defender interrupted the process which cause the issue? Started the extraction over and everything went fine. Repeated the Download/installation a few more time with no issues.</li>
<li>When installing from <a href="http://Whonix.org">Whonix.org</a>, Windows automatically restarts (to finish installation?) This <em>only</em> happened after build when:
<ul>
<li>Norton quarantined <code>Whonix.exe</code> at the start of build and the installer obviously wouldn’t work. But a file is created .\Output\InstallWhonix.exe that works to install Whonix when executed. However, when run this also restarted Windows the same as above. The <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> did not do this.(Windows restart)</li>
</ul>

;!@InstallEnd@!
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>To recap. This happened when:</p>
<ol>
<li>(after building from source) I ran the wrong executable (<code>InstallWhonix.exe</code>) which is built along side the <code>Whonix Installer</code> and can be found in \current_working_directory\InstallWhonix.exe</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the reasons for changing the installer name from <code>Install Whonix.exe</code> to <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> . (to prevent confusion)</p>
<p>Not sure of the purpose of this executable?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>When Norton anti-virus qaurantines a needed file when the <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> is run. This has happen to me more than a few times…</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously there could be other reasons for this issue.</p>

<p>This is a common <em>fix</em> for Windows users. But I think we can do better…</p>
<p>When I start working on development again I plan on trying to resolve this issue and work on better error handling for the installer.</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/vboxmanage import /path/to/ova --vsys 0 --eula accept

<p>Perhaps <code>--vsys 0</code> can or must be dropped since only a single VM and not two VMs in one ova.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/18343" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/18343</a> says this could be an out of disk space issue. Do [all] disks have enough disk space? Let’s say two or three times as much as ova size (even with VirtualBox VMs on drive <code>D:</code> VirtualBox might do extraction/temporary files on drive <code>C:</code>, dunno).</p>

            <p>Maybe a version mismatch? Windows installer VirtualBox version is outdated. And Kicksecure was created with latest stable version of VirtualBox.</p>
<p>Maybe updating VirtualBox would solve this?</p>

            <p>Had an issue when importing Kicksecure ova image in VirtualBox. The error message isn’t all that helpfull.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Code: E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I previously used <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Whonix-Windows-Installer" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Whonix-Windows-Installer</a> to install VitrualBox and Whonix. Reinstalled VitrualBox and was able to import the Kicksecure ova.</p>
<p>If I remove Kicksecure ova image and run Whonix installer again, then try to import the Kicksecure ova image again the same thing happens.</p>

            <p>Downloaded and installed from <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix.org</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First time extracting had an error. My guess would be Norton antivirus or Windows defender interrupted the process which cause the issue? Started the extraction over and everything went fine. Repeated the Download/installation a few more time with no issues.</li>
<li>When installing from <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix.org</a>, Windows automatically restarts (to finish installation?) This <em>only</em> happened after build when:
<ul>
<li>Norton quarantined  <code>Whonix.exe</code> at the start of build and the installer obviously wouldn’t work. But a file is created  .\Output\InstallWhonix.exe that works to install Whonix when executed. However, when run this also restarted Windows the same as above. The <code>whonix-installer.exe</code> did not do this.(Windows restart)</li>
