    <title>SQLMap not working on Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/sqlmap-not-working-on-workstation/553</link>
    <description>I have whonix installed within Qubes. All works fine, tor browser works fine. I can use curl from the terminal and it works.

But, I installed SQLMap and targeted my site. It timed out. So I set timeout to 300 seconds (testing), and it timed out again. I tried on my macbook and SQLMap connects to my site fine, so it&#39;s not my site. I also tested SQLMap using Google, Github, MSN ... nothing.

What could be going wrong? Is there anything I need to do on the workstation for the SQLMap to work?

Just to add, if I also do: ping google.com that also times out, even though the Tor browser is working fine. I have the gateway on, and verified with whonixcheck.</description>
