    <title>Network connectivity issues.</title>

    <description>Good day to all. I apologize in advance for mistakes; knowledge of English, alas, is not up to par.
I encountered such a problem that I have no internet on virtual windows 7, which is combined with Whonix Gateway. Also, there was a problem (screenshot 1) in Whonix Gateway, how to solve it?
Below are screenshots of network settings in windows and gateway.
As well as links to the manuals on which the installation was made.

Images didn’t work, so here is the error text from Whonix
&quot;ERROR: check network interfaces Result: network interface eth1 not up! If you know what you are doing, feel free to disable this check. Create a file /etc/whonix.d/50_whonixcheck_user.conf and add: 
whonixcheck_skip_functions+=&quot; check_network_interfaces &quot;
Debugging information: Command sudo --non-interactive cat /sys/class/net/eth1/carrier failed.&quot;</description>
