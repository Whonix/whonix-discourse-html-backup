          <p>so, i created a quick test vm with 16 gigs total disk space to simulate a more conservative external drive. i can confirm that virt-sparsify stalled out once the hard drive was full in that set up while processing the first whonix disk. however, the method documented above with qemu-img worked fine.</p>

<p>it’s not quite there yet. i’m aware that it’s quite dirty. i’ll tidy it up with the appropriate quoting and such once a final version is ready. still looking into whether it can be used to control a vm to boot in recovery mode and do a zerofree pass.</p>

</aside>
<p>here’s the first beta version. it comes up clean on <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://shellcheck.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">shellcheck.net</a>.</p>
<p>i have given up on trying to script booting the vms into recovery mode and running the zerofree pass for now. however, i did make some additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the script will sort disks based on whether they are a primary disk (/dev/vda1) or an additional disk (/dev/vdb1, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the disk is a primary disk, the script will check if a backing image is present for the disk based on the ending filename extension of “.backing.image.”  if a backing image is not present, the script will create a backing image for the disk and then create a thin provisioned disk to be used going forward.  the advantage of this are that the backing image is read only and can offer a means of restoration if something unforeseen happens, whether it’s the thin disk getting corrupted or the user making an error in persistent mode. an additional advantage is that, due to the smaller size of the thin provisioned disk, less disk reads/writes are needed for future passes of zerofree and qemu-img, due to the fact that the backing image is not read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the disk is an additional disk, which are only used for persistent storage in my usage, the “qemu-img convert” command is used to create a new image of the disk. since the files stored on such disks tend to be important, i think it makes more sense to keep the data in one disk image, rather than being fractured in thin provisioned images with the additional disk as a backing image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the script creates a backup image of the disk image first and then creates a new disk image from the backup image.  after the qemu-img pass is complete, the user is prompted to boot the corresponding virtual machine to make sure the process was successful and did not result in corruption.  the user is then given the option to remove the backup file. if something bad happened during the conversion, which is discovered on booting the vm, the user has the option of restoring the image from the backup file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>i will likely add some colors to the script later in order to make it easier to read and clean up the stdout formatting.  but, if anyone who is using qemu/kvm wants to test this, please give it a try.</p>

<p>What happens in case the user doesn’t delete the backup image (<code>"Remove $f.backup? [y/N] "</code>) (probably not will think this is a good idea) and then re-runs the script? It would overwrite the already existing backup? (<code>"Remove $f.backup? [y/N] "</code>)<br>

<p>use of sudo: Probably better to check if the script is running as root and abort otherwise? Better than running sudo inside the script?</p>

</aside>
<p>a “backing image” is a disk image that thin provisioned images use as the base file.  so, changes made to the thin provisioned disk image are not written to the “backing image.” aside from protecting the initial base whonix install from accidental error, it requires less data to be written in the future, since the new images created by “qemu-img convert” that use a backing file will tend to be in the range of megabytes rather than gigabytes.</p>

</aside>
<p>“qemu-img convert” does not appear to do in place conversion.  when it converts the temporary “backup” image into the new image, it removes all the sectors that were written with zeros by zerofree, thus reducing the file size.</p>

<p>this creates a thin provisioned disk image that use “$f.backing.image” as the backing image.  the thin provisioned image will be nearly empty upon creation. future disk writes go to the thin provisioned image.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Why care about past 24 hours?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>because if one has not used the virtual machine in the past 24 hours, it likely does not have any data written to it that requires the time and disk writes to shrink the image.  ideally, one will run the script after they have installed operating system updates in the virtual machine.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Why distinguish between non-persistent and persistent disks?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>because the persistent disks tend to have more personalized data on it. so, i implemented a separate routine for those disks in order to keep everything confined to one disk image.  if i used the method that implements a backing image, then additional data would get written to a thin provisioned disk, and if one wanted to copy that virtual disk to another machine, they’d have to execute additional commands to have all of the data contained in one virtual disk.</p>

<p>Ok, creates only if not existing.<br>
Why would <code>"$f".backing.image</code> already exist and would it be correct to continue then?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>a “backing image” for thinly provisioned clients only needs to be created once.  the script will create one if it isn’t there.  thus, if it exists, the steps that would otherwise create a “backing image” are skipped. if it didn’t check for the existence and created a new thin provisioned disk with the same name as the current thin provisioned image created before, it would overwrite the data in the old thin provisioned disk. easiest way to think of these are as snapshots.  the thin provisioned disks are essentially external snapshots that rely on the “backing image” to provide the base of the data needed to boot the system.</p>

          <p>here’s the updated version. i took a number of the points into consideration.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the initial long commands to populate the variables were not something i was able to shorten unfortunately. however, i broke them up so that they are easier to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sudo has been removed. sudo was there because, before this blew up into a fairly long script, it was intended to work as a function in .bashrc, similar to the more simplistic way virtual disk shrinking can be done with virtualbox. unfortunately, that’s not currently a reality with kvm. the script will check if it is being run with root privileges and, if it isn’t, will prompt a user to use sudo to execute the script and exit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comments are now at nearly every step to explain what the script is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the text is all visible in nano from a standard sized terminal window. however, it still may be a little annoying to view it with the scrolls bars in this forum. so, while i’m going to paste it here, it may be easier to review from the pastebin link i created at <a href="../../../external.html?link=https://pastebin.com/tNz06ETB" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pastebin.com/tNz06ETB</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>one of the more annoying lack of user friendly features with kvm at the moment is creating snapshots. unfortunately, if one uses the default method of internal snapshots with virt-manager, which is supposedly deprecated, the creation of a new slimmer disk image will not include the snapshots. thus, any snapshots become ghost entries that don’t work. while this was not intended to be a “backup” script, i could probably play with it further to create unique “snapshot” folders for the temporary external thin provisioned images. it would probably be easy enough to create a filename structure based on disk image name, date and time. but, i have not tried that yet.</p>

<p>That I find a leap. Take a simpler use case. Someone using only Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. The runs the shrink script. Nothing happens and the user doesn’t even know why. Maybe this would be a useful optional feature but a non-configurable default feature seems surprising, confusing.</p>

<h3><a href="../../../external.html?link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" target="_blank">Principle of least astonishment</a></h3>

<p>The principle of least astonishment (POLA), also called the principle of least surprise (alternatively a "law" or "rule") applies to user interface and software design. A typical formulation of the principle, from 1984, is: "If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature."
 More generally, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; the behavior should not astonish or surprise...</p>

<p>What if the backing image exists but is broken? Such as when the machine crashed, was powered off, rebooted or the process interrupted last time the script was run?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>since the backing image is read only, this should not matter. virtual machine crashes won’t affect the state of the backing image. absent disk corruption, the backing image should be rock solid. additionally, since the disk images, per instructions, should be in a read only state in order to get the full advantages of “live mode,” a new image created from a disk image that would be problematic from such crashes would have to involve a crash where someone was executing the zerofree run after an upgrade procedure or the installation of new software in a persistent mode setting, since the vm should always be run in “live mode” with the “readonly” flag set to “true” on the virtual disk otherwise. for this reason, after new images are created, the user is prompted to run the vm to make sure it boots and the data is readable before removing the temp file. if it is not bootable, or data is not readable, the user is given the option to restore the temp file, which will return the vm to its state before such a problem occurred. if such a problematic crash occurred before the zerofree run and the running of the script, it wouldn’t be script related and i’m not sure how this script could address it. instead, this would require instructions informing the user to backup their image before they put it in persistent mode to either do a dist-upgrade or install new software. but, that would be a whonix qemu/kvm use problem that exists outside of this script.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>If backing image exists:</p>
<pre><code>qemu-img convert -B "$f".backing.image -O qcow2 -p "$f".temp "$f"
</code></pre>
<p>I don’t understand why these are two different procedures / commands.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>the first part of the above creates a backing image and creates a new thin provisioned image that refers to the backing image. the second part, which executes only if a backing image exists, the script converts a previously existing thin provisioned image to a new thin provisioned image that copies the data from the old thin provisioned image, which exists as the main disk that kvm boots. based on how the existing kvm config works, it refers to one unique specific file name for booting whonix. the script is written to work seamlessly with that in mind.</p>
<p>if the former executed every time, it would treat the thin provisioned image as the main disk, and then make it the backing image from which a new thin provisioned image would be created. this would result in data loss, since the majority of the data that makes up whonix would be erased, as a thin provisioned image does not include all the data of a backing image.</p>
<p>the commands involved are different. when no backing image is detected, a routine is run to remove the zero written space from the existing image and making it a backing image. then a command is executed to create a new thin provisioned image from there. the part that runs when a backing image already exists copies the existing thin provisioned image to a temp file and creates a new thin provisioned from there, which includes all the data in the old thin provisioned image, and refers to the backing image as the base.</p>
<p>to simplify the above, when a backing image does not exist, a backing image is created and a thin provisioned disk is CREATED that refers to the the backing image.</p>
<p>when a backing image and thin provisioned image does exist, the thin provisioned image is CONVERTED into a new image that refers to the backing image.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t that be…?</p>
<pre><code>if no backing image exists:
    create backing image

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>no. because, when the backing image doesn’t exist, the backing image is created and a new thin provisioned image is created that uses it. when the backing image already exists with a corresponding thin provisioned image, the script converts the old thin provisioned image into a new one, which preserves the data from the old thin provisioned image. if it created a thin provisioned image from the exsting backing image every time, rather than the existing thin provisioned image, all the data in the existing thin provisioned image would be lost, since the backing image would be used is as the base, and thus upgrades contained in the existing thin provisioned image that were implemented at times would be lost. perhaps i’m overlooking something here (my sleep and work has been off lately). but, the way it is scripted does not pose the risk of data loss, which would require more downloads to make whonix current with the latest upgrades and require more disk writes.</p>
<p>these are separate and distinct commands. when no backing image exists, a thinner backing image is created and a brand new thin provisioned image that refers to it is created. when the backing image already exists, the existing thin provision image is used to create a new thin provisioned image that refers to the backing image.</p>

<p>first and foremost, i am not taking any of this personally. critique as much as possible. i am working on this in my free time which is limited. thus, there is room for much perfection here that i will miss. also, i wrote this script with instructions that i will be providing to users that reference my guide in mind. so, that will color this script. if i am making problematic errors in that regard, they absolutely need to be adressed. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>on this section, the goal is to prevent someone from executing unneeded disk writes. while i could leave as an option involved, perhaps it would make more sense if i simply explained in output to the user from the script that images not modified in the past 24 hours will not be touched? i could tweak the script to give a message that “this image has not been modified in the past 24 hours and likely does not need to be processed.” or, i could provide a prompt that states something like "if you did not run zerofree in recovery mode on this image since you last ran this script, you can choose “no.”  with those, i could remove the time restriction if you think it is more beneficial.  but, especially for an ssd drive, if someone simply ignores it and runs the process, it will result in additional disk writes that will result in no benefit.</p>
<p>since the script will only run on an image where someone has set it in persistent mode in the past 24 hours, they will arguably run it within that time frame after they have manually done a zerofree run. again, this is something i could explain in the script.  but, it makes more sense to explain in the instructions on how to put the vm into a state where the script will be useful.  if they don’t run the script within 24 hours of a manual zerofree run in persistent mode, the next time they run a zerofree run in persistent mode, the same beneficial results will occur if they run the script within 24 hours. so, the only downside here is an extra length of time for a larger disk i believe.</p>
<p>this is arguably a scenario where virt-sparisfy work as a better tool, since it would take all user guessing out of it, doesn’t require a manual zerofree run, and could be set to simply run on every image located. but, based on my tests, it involves mcuh greater writing of data that is not required, and may pose problems for people using smaller disks, particularly for people using a msall usb thumb drive that is not affected in the same way based on how the script is currently written.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why distinguish between non-persistent and persistent disks?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is also a very personalized conclusion. Many users probably are not using secondary disk images. Only the defaults and have everything there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>if they do not have a secondary disk, this part of the script will not appear. for people who use a secondary disk to store persistent data, such as emails, gpg keys, ssh keys, etc, it will. it’s personalized in the sense that i’ve taken into consideration that users may have followed the instructions i’ve written to preserve email, keepassxc, ssh, gpg, etc, related files on a persistent hd, which would otherwise get forgotten in a straight “all files on one virtual hd” live mode config with kvm. thus, it offers the ability to have live mode forget any changes to the core / files on reboot, while preserving others that may be changed, and need to be persistent, in common use.</p>
<p>this may warrant another discussion. unless i’ve missed something, the only other method i’ve seen discussed to store persistent data is to open the host hd to saving files in a shared folder. aside from opening the host hd to potential malware writes, i believe there are also issues involving snapshotting or other things if users remove files from a shared directory from inside the vm. so, using a secondary persistent virtual disk seemed cleaner. but, i could be mistaken there. the persistent virtual disk is also obviously susceptible to malware writes. but, it made more sense to me to confine such a threat to a virtual disk rather than the host disk.</p>

</aside>
<p>true. however, perhaps it is a false assumption on my part. i’m envisioning a scenario where someone had an issue with the base whonix os image, and wanted to reinstall a new version. in that regard, they are unlikely to copy the primary disk over. rather, they will create a new vm from a fresh whonix install. for the secondary disks, which contain custom personalized data, it’s simply easier to add that as an addtional disk, and mount it from the /etc/fstab in the new whonix image. if the secondary disks used the backing image method, they’d first need to commit the thin provisioned disk image to the backing image if they make a copy, which is an extra step that people might forget, and might result in data loss. ideally, everything on the primary disk should be relatively default, which makes a reinstall in that regard less of an issue compared to a secondary persistent disk which contains custom data that will be very problematic to lose.</p>

<p>check the end of the if statement that creates the backing image. it is set to “y” at that point. if the for loop catches other disks where a backing image is not created, but a backing image exists, if the user chooses to remove the “temp” file due to a boot issue, it will also remove the backing image without this flag set, unless i am mistaken. the point of this variable is to deal with a situation where a new backing image is created, the user attempts to boot per the instructions after the backing image is created, something goes wrong, and they choose to restore the temp file to it’s original state. with the flag set, it will copy the temp file back to the original file name, thus restoring the original data, and delete the backing file. in a situation without this flag set, if the issue is with a newly created thin image from a previous thin provisioned image, the backing file will be deleted and result in  extreme data loss, which will require a fresh install since the backing image is gone. without the flag, the option is left to either result in the script potentially removing the backing image, or requiring the user to remove an uneeded multi-gigabyte backing image manually.</p>

<p>Generally, I might not be getting the full context of this. I wasn’t<br>
considering live mode or the context in which this might appear in the<br>
guide. I was looking at it from a very generalized perspective. Such as<br>
for inclusion into the usability-misc package. For users who don’t read<br>
your guide, don’t use live mode and just use the default images for<br>
everything. For these an /easy/tool/to/compact-vm would be cool. One<br>
tool could be /path/to/compact-this-disk-image. Or<br>
/path/to/compact-disk-images-of-vm-by-vm-name. Also also compact-all-vms.</p>
<p>As per murphy’s law, anything can go wrong, will go wrong. At some<br>
point, someone will cancel/out of memory killed/power loss within an<br>
operation (such as running qemu-img) and then lead to unexpected<br>
results. At some point such users are going to ask about it in the forums.</p>
<p>Therefore I am trying to foresee such situations and prevent these if<br>
possible. Scripts should be idempotent.</p>

<p>Ideally, no matter where a previous run of the script might have been<br>
interrupted, a re-run of the script shouldn’t make assumptions about<br>
previous runs. Otherwise murphy’s law is going to hit in future.</p>
<p>Sometimes a script can make assumptions about previous runs. For<br>
example, if an action (such as qemu-img something) succeeded, a success<br>
file can be created. Next time the script is run, use of that success<br>
file would be reliable. (Well, it wouldn’t cover cases in which data<br>
corruption damaged the file. (<code>echo "" &gt; /path/to/file</code>) Ideally there<br>
would be a sanity test but I doubt that exists. md5sum might be<br>
sufficient here since fast and not a security relevant test?</p>

<p>Generally, I might not be getting the full context of this. I wasn’t<br>
considering live mode or the context in which this might appear in the<br>
guide. I was looking at it from a very generalized perspective. Such as<br>
for inclusion into the usability-misc package. For users who don’t read<br>
your guide, don’t use live mode and just use the default images for<br>
everything. For these an /easy/tool/to/compact-vm would be cool.</p>

</aside>
<p>the script should work as intended for someone who is using a default kvm whonix package in persistent mode.  in fact, to get it to work for someone using the “live mode” function generally with the flag in virt-manager set to “readonly” on the disk, additional steps outside of the script need to be taken. however, i will remove the time restriction and explore having the script inform the user that a file has not been recently modified. that may make more sense.</p>

<p>As per murphy’s law, anything can go wrong, will go wrong. At some<br>
point, someone will cancel/out of memory killed/power loss within an<br>
operation (such as running qemu-img) and then lead to unexpected<br>
results. At some point such users are going to ask about it in the forums.</p>
<p>Therefore I am trying to foresee such situations and prevent these if<br>
possible. Scripts should be idempotent.</p>

<p>Ideally, no matter where a previous run of the script might have been<br>
interrupted, a re-run of the script shouldn’t make assumptions about<br>
previous runs. Otherwise murphy’s law is going to hit in future.</p>
<p>Sometimes a script can make assumptions about previous runs. For<br>
example, if an action (such as qemu-img something) succeeded, a success<br>
file can be created. Next time the script is run, use of that success<br>
file would be reliable. (Well, it wouldn’t cover cases in which data<br>
corruption damaged the file. (<code>echo "" &gt; /path/to/file</code>) Ideally there<br>
would be a sanity test but I doubt that exists. md5sum might be<br>
sufficient here since fast and not a security relevant test?</p>

<p>true. the first step of the script that physically alters a file is when the image is moved to the “.temp” file. the final run of the routine, assuming a user decides that the process was successful, removes the the “.temp” file.  so, a simplistic means of addressing such crash scenarios could be to have the script check if a “.temp” file exists before proceeding and, if it does, inform the user about it while mentioning the above referenced crash scenarios, and ask if they want to restore from it.  i can play with this to attempt to be more cautious about such scenarios.</p>

</aside>
<p>based on the options that are currently presented to a user, there is the potential for a user to choose not to delete the .temp file, even if everything is working.  so, the presence of a .temp file may not be evidence of a crash or something else going wrong. for example, it may involve a user who wanted to play with the recently changed vm that wants to keep the .temp file as a backup in case they want to roll back the vm to a previous state.  or, it simply could involve a scenario where the user pressed “enter” to quickly when asked if they want to remove the .temp file and, since the script defaults to treat the choice as “no,” the .temp file is simply a useless extra file.</p>
<p>i could set the script to automatically run from the conversion steps if a .temp file is located.  however, if a user had recently made changes to the current disk image that they intend to keep, automatically converting from the old .temp image would erase those changes.</p>
<p>so, i think presenting the user with a prompt about the presence of the .temp images, and then offering options that may include “restore the temp file,” “create a new shrunken image from the temp file,” or “delete the temp file” is probably the safer option.</p>

<p>it would not be sane if the user is keeping it as a rollback file.  it’s unlikely, yes. however, i could better address this if i made the storing of the .temp file as a snapshot image and then create another user script to manage them.  i just haven’t moved that far into the project yet.</p>
<p>with the current script, a temp “copy” is not made. rather, the original image to be shrunken is renamed to $f.temp. this was done to minimize the amount of disk writes and disk space needed. in that regard, the “$f.temp” file could be treated as the lock file as well. i could rewrite the script to automatically remove $f.temp if a user decides that they don’t want to restore from $f.temp after they boot the virtual machine.</p>

          <p>i’m debugging a new “alpha” version right now. it’s a little more of a complex process than i expected.</p>
<p>so far, it will create the thin images. if a user chooses to create a snapshot of the primary disk images, it will check for a “deballoon-snapshots” directory in the same directory where the disk image is located, create a unique subdirectory named after the disk image in the “deballoon-snapshots” directory, and create a snapshot file in the subdirectory that includes the date and time in the file name. if the snapshot directories do not exist, the script will create them.  i named the main snapshot directory “deballoon-snapshots” so that nobody will confuse it with a snapshot directory created by virt-manager.</p>
<p>also, various lock files are created at different steps in the script to determine where a crash occurred or where a user hit ctrl-c. the checking for the lock files throughout the script is where it has gotten a little complex.</p>
