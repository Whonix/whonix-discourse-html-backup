    <description>@nrgaway

I&#39;m a bit confused on the install/update objectives here...


Is the &quot;qubes-whonix&quot; package meant to *only* be installed with the build script?

Or is it *also* meant to be updated via the Whonix APT repository using apt-get (i thought yes)?


Also, when installed with the build script, is it meant to be called via the Qubes qubes-builder script or the Whonix build script (i thought via whonix)?</description>

            <p>[quote=“nrgaway, post:6, topic:866”]I’m not too sure how this is going to work.  The 9.6 branch is ready to go so you could look at the code and add it to the Whonix repo; so if that’s enabled so will be qubes-whonix.</p>
<p>The Debian package is also complete.  You will see a Makefile.builder.  That needs to remain untouched since currently qubes-builder builds the package and that Makefile has all the code required to tar up an .orig file; install the packages to debian/qubes-builder, etc.  Your Makefiles remain for when it is built with Whonix in the future but currently they are automatically removed during the qubes build process.</p>
<p>The plan is to release the Whonix 9.6 version very soon.  If we can’t get a repo going quick enough on your end; I’m sure qubes can host it for now.</p>

<p>Awesome that things are ready for 9.6! Great work!</p>
<p>Unless there is an emergency reason to release right away, then it is probably better for the project to establish a lasting convention and process of using the Whonix repo for the “qubes-whonix” package.</p>
<p>That way, there doesn’t unnecessarily have to be split versions regarding the “qubes-whonix” update infrastructure in the future, which would further complexify user support issues, etc.</p>
<p>There’s already an issue of uncertainty right now between users on the old Dual-HVM platform and the new ProxyVM + AppVM platform.</p>
<p>As far as getting the Whonix repo setup for this…</p>
<p>I will look through the “qubes-whonix” package today.</p>
<p>Hopefully Patrick can do the same soon and publish to the Whonix repo.</p>
<p>And then we can have ITL build and release new RPMs.</p>
<p>Does this sound okay?</p>

<p>Good question to nrgaway.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it makes sense to use the Whonix repo, since Qubes represents the more static OS infrastructure beneath Whonix and Whonix is more like the dynamic application on top of Qubes that is changing more often.</p>
<p>There is probably more flexibility for dynamic development by basing such things here in the Whonix community.</p>
<p>Qubes Git repos are seemingly often not in a consistent updated or stable state, which could also further interfere with plans to support build instructions, if we published “qubes-whonix” through ITL infrastructure.</p>
<p>We could certainly also ping the Qubes team and community for additional vetting when readying a new “qubes-whonix” package version.</p>

<p>Sounds good. Yes, checking for non-maliciousness would be the only default expectation upon final merging/release into Whonix.</p>

<p>Yeah, thanks. I think keeping releases tied into existing Whonix project repository is the way to go still at this point.</p>
<p>People already trust the infrastructure of the repo and team member(s) who filter what code gets into it (Patrick).</p>

<p>There is a Qubes update repository in the Whonix templates now for updating the Qubes integration tools.</p>
<p>However, this Qubes update repository is not related to the Whonix templates.</p>
<p>The original ITL release of the Whonix templates is solely contained within the Qubes build scripts and requires manually building a new set of templates to update right now (which hasn’t been re-done by ITL as of yet).</p>
<p>The “qubes-whonix” package is now a new entity since the original ITL release. I suspect the “qubes-whonix” package will be incorporated into his next upcoming version, but maybe not with APT update capability yet, until prepared and processed through the Whonix repo.</p>
