    <description>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s wanted but the default style (xfce-dusk if I remember right) doesn&#39;t recognize the colors of the cells in openoffice and in general doesn&#39;t guarantee a good readability (for example the menus are gray and very strong green), ofc the problem is easily solved by changing the style but I would like to understand if it&#39;s a desired effect, because it&#39;s quite strange as a default choice</description>
