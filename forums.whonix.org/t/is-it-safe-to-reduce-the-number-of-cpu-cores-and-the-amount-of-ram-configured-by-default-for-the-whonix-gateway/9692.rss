    <description>Hello guys

**Is it safe to reduce the number of CPU cores and the amount of RAM configured by default for the Whonix Gateway?**

I have an XPS 15 I bought last year with an i5 8th generation and 8GB of RAM on a solid state drive and onboard GPU.

My operating system is Windows 10 (fresh instal / zero problems).
I am using the latest version of Wonix Gateway + Workstation for Virtual Box (fresh instal / zero problems).

However, since I installed the newest version of Whonix I have been experiencing freezes and overload in CPU usage.

I had never experienced these problems with previous versions so I decided to check what was going on.

At that point I discovered that the new Whonix Gateway is configured by default to use 3 colors of my CPU and 1920MB of memory.

But I only use Whonix Gateway to disguise my ip. It even stay most of his time minimized. That way I don&#39;t understand why it requires such high specifications by default.

So my main question is:
**It is SAFE to go to the virtual machine settings in the Virtual Box interface and change the settings to 1 core CPU and 256 RAM.**

Can this type of change cause some internal &#39;break&#39; in Whonix Gatewat and decrease its effectiveness in camouflaging my IP?

Thank you!</description>

<p>Won’t break routing traffic over Tor. Worst case in theory would be to not route any traffic at all. Zero connectivity. Or slow speed.</p>

<p>Safe. During upgrades (as in <code>apt dist-upgrade</code>) more RAM may be required. (512 MB)</p>
