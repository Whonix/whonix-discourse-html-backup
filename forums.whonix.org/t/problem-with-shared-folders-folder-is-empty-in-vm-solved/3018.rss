    <title>Problem with shared folders (Folder is empty in VM) (SOLVED)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/problem-with-shared-folders-folder-is-empty-in-vm-solved/3018</link>
    <description>Hello.

I have tried to use the shared folders option by following
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Shared_Folders

But it does not seem to be working. I did everything the guide said, and the /mnt/shared directory appeared in Whonix Workstation. Then I transfered my files from my host to /mnt/shared/ on my host. Then I entered the folder on my Whonix Workstation, but it is empty. I tried rebooting the Workstation, but it is still empty. 

The guide did not say if I should use 
chown -R yourusername /mnt/shared
on my host or my Workstation, so I first tried the Workstation, but the shared folder was still empty, so I also tried running it on my host, and that did not work either.

Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance :)

EDIT: I dont know why the link I inserted has added &quot;Using Whonix with KVM instead of VirtualBox&quot;... I just linked to the KVM shared folders section on the wiki.</description>
