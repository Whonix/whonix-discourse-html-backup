            <p>Confirmed. Saw this on myself before. apt-get is somehow sandboxed since Debian stretch. iptables rules can no longer be changed during apt-get upgrades. In result, if Whonix firewall iptables rules were to change, which they did not, reboot would be required.</p>
<p>So for now it can be safely ignored.</p>
