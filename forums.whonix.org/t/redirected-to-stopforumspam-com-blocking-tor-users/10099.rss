    <description>Continuing the discussion from [ISP is based on web login and I cant access website on gateway](https://forums.whonix.org/t/isp-is-based-on-web-login-and-i-cant-access-website-on-gateway/1900/11):

HI, 

I&#39;ve come across another issue while trying to fix a different issue and I was directed to this site to cross=check the IP I was using with Whonix.  I&#39;ve tried accessing the site under different IPs randomly generated by whonix but the result was always the same.   Here is the site I was directed to

https://www.stopforumspam.com

What I would I like to know is how to circumvent this issue while keep my privacy.  

Thanks,</description>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying.  I wasn’t aware sites could block tor specifically.  Sorry, I posted the link to the filter.</p>

            <p>Not much you can do. Any workaround will be non-ideal. If websites decide to block Tor users you can only try to friendly advocate to not block Tor.</p>
<p>It’s a Tor issue. Would happen with Tor Browser too. Not an issue introduced by Whonix. -&gt; <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a> applies.</p>
