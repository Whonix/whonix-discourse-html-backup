    <description>Hi.

I followed the Whonix I2P guide. TOR&gt;I2P. It went well. But what do I do after the install? How do I configure the router settings? Are we supposed to disable IP6 in there? Just not sure on what settings I should be running on the router.

Is there an I2P browser I can install in Whonix so that it is separate from the normal browser?

Thanks</description>
