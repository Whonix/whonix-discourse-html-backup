    <title>enable wiki talk pages?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/enable-wiki-talk-pages/1734</link>
    <description>Is there a (whonix) wiki talk page facility as I see on wikipedia?

Making a minor change, grammar, spelling, I&#39;m comfortable with going in and editing it.

Not so much on less trivial changes - but went looking for an article&#39;s talk page to make mention of what occurred to me.

I do see user/profile talk pages, but no ability to add/edit/start such (on a page&#39;s current author).

If talk has deliberately been turned off by conscious decision, say, in favour of a forum post, could that be noted in an edit page somehow? (Perhaps surrounding the &quot;Your changes will be displayed to readers once an authorized user accepts them. (help)&quot; text?)

Bonus points if clicking a link automatically puts one in compose mode on a post in the appropriate forum, subject titled with page / section / whatever notations.

Don&#39;t want to edit with &quot;I have heard such and so&quot; to be moderated ... then the author / moderator must put out effort to remove the descriptive commentary surrounding such conditional contributions - even more work.

A talk page instead lets the such and so be noted, and the author, moderator, or other page subscribers, confirm, correct, deny, accept, as community deemed appropriate.</description>

there is actually too much activity to justify the split.</p>

            <p>Yes, I know, however I suspect you / the reader would want to separate non-wiki website issues from wiki talk.</p>
<p>e.g. website down / page not working is a different order of message than ‘wiki page on x misses concept y within section z’.</p>
<p>Many readers would be interested in a page or some other website aspect not working heads up, while only documentation readers / authors / moderators would be interested in such.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Maybe dev/documentation makes more sense than website/wiki.</p>

            <p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, a separate website/wiki subforum is appropriate?</p>
<p>(And if so, perhaps a top sticky post with recommendations about subject / content / format? I guess wiki talk pages are essentially design and/or code review. Makes me wonder if git brings anything to such a party.)</p>

            <p>Wiki talk pages require the new page creation right, which we disabled, because those have shown to be a great source of spam. Also wiki talk pages generally have shown to be a great source of spam. And actual discussion on wiki talk pages is cumbersome. <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-as-a-replacement-for-mediawiki-talk-pages/2217/9">Unfortunately, there is no mediawiki extension ‘discourse forum integration’, that would use the discourse forum as mediawiki talk pages.</a></p>
<p>If you want to make any bigger changes, you can create a new forum discussion thread if there isn’t already one for that page. It’s fine to have a forum thread linked that links to a forum thread. (Just did that with the i2p page - <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P.)">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P.)</a></p>
<p>We can also create temporary wiki pages on request. I.e. if <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P</a> is the normal page, then <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P_temp">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P_temp</a> can be created for big proposals you are unsure about. Once agreement has been found, it can be copied back to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P</a>.</p>
