    <title>How can you run/start dpkg to install a .deb file on Whonix?</title>

    <description>Hi. Whonix is based on Debian, right?

I am trying to install a .deb file and I have been googling for hours but I can&#39;t find an answer to this. 

It all says I have to use dpkg and type &quot;dpkg -i filename.deb&quot; 

But it doesn&#39;t say how I can start dpkg and WHERE I have to type &quot;dpkg -i filename.deb&quot; 

Can somebody tell me where I have to type in these command lines?

Which button/icon do I need to click to use dpkg?</description>

            <p>Whonix isn’t different from Debian in this regard.</p>
<p>You can start dpkg by running “dpkg” in a terminal (Konsole). (You find Konsole in the start menu and in Whonix also on the desktop as a shortcut.) Then “dpkg -i /path/to/filename.deb”.</p>
<p>Note, dpkg is just a vehicle to get .debs installed. The better way to install packages is using apt-get (which internally uses dpkg), because apt-get will also keep the package updated. To do this, you need an apt repository. I don’t know if Opera is still providing one. In past they did. See also <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Opera">https://wiki.debian.org/Opera</a> or Opera’s own Debian [stable, currently: wheezy] specific instructions. Those can be used 1 to 1 in Whonix.</p>
<p>When a .desktop file gets installed, you won’t find a .desktop file in start menu. Most likely, if Opera provides a .desktop file [I explained above how you can check if the package contains a .desktop file], then you most likely will find Opera under start menu -&gt; applications -&gt; internet -&gt; Opera.</p>
<p>As a side note, in case you don’t know already, in context of anonymity, Tor Browser is recommended, other browsers are recommended against. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser</a>)</p>

            <p>[quote=“Patrick, post:2, topic:128”]Usually the .deb’s documentation on its website or man page explains how to use that tool. But if it doesn’t, see below…</p>
<p>Whonix is based on Debian. Installing debs with “dpkg -i” is correct. .debs can not be started in that sense. They are supposed to be installed, what you already did. The question you’re currently having is how to use the package.</p>
<p>Graphical applications usually install a .desktop file, which you can find in start menu. You can check, if the package you installed contains a .desktop file.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hi. Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I haven’t installed the deb file yet because I don’t know how to start dpkg.</p>
<p>What I want to is to install the Debian version of Opera Browser on Whonix. I downloaded the the .deb file from Opera’s website and I want to install it using dpkg but I don’t know how I can start dpkg.</p>
<p>Where can I find .desktop file on Whonix? I clicked the start button and searched .desktop but nothing showed up.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I don’t know much about Linux.</p>

<p>Whonix is based on Debian. Installing debs with “dpkg -i” is correct. .debs can not be started in that sense. They are supposed to be installed, what you already did. The question you’re currently having is how to use the package.</p>
<p>Graphical applications usually install a .desktop file, which you can find in start menu. You can check, if the package you installed contains a .desktop file.</p>
<p>Taken from <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/32507/how-do-i-get-a-list-of-installed-files-from-a-package" data-bbcode="true">source</a>.</p>
<p>To see all the files the package installed onto your system, do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>To see the files a .deb file will install</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>If so, you should be able to start it in start menu.</p>
<p>When it doesn’t provide a .desktop file, and if it is a package that provides startable files**, it will most likely have installed that tool into a directory which is included in the $PATH variable.</p>
<p>To see the contents of $PATH, you can use this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p><code>sudo su
echo $PATH</code></p>
<p>For example, if you had installed a packages called faketime… You’d see by using…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>That it installed /usr/bin/faketime. So from now you can use.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Or just.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>(**There are packages that doesn’t provide startable files, but other stuff, such as files used by other packages (extensions), programming libraries, fonts, pictures, etc.)</p>
