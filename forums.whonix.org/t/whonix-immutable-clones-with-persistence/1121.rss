    <description>This setup is based from tempest&#39;s great guide (most current version still in beta): http://yuxv6qujajqvmypv.onion/betadownload.html &gt; p379-433 which is listed in topic: https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,156.0.html and whonix wiki content based on .vdi creation which I cannot find the link to.

I cloned my Gateway and Workstation using Virtual Box then set them as &quot;immutable&quot; drives. Next a &quot;storage&quot; folder was created in the Workstation and set as &quot;writethrough&quot; so it persists through each new use.
With this setup, every time I start the cloned Gateway and Workstation (called Gateway [Mitigated] and Workstation [Mitigated] in tempest&#39;s guide) it loads the most current snapshot of the cloned/[Mitigated] drives and the only thing that saves data through each restart is the storage folder created. Everything else is reverted to the most recent snapshot. I am trying to understand the potential dangers of doing this.

-By using these cloned drives which load the current snapshot, will it be easier to de-anonymize me?
-Will I be assigned the same Tor exit nodes/circuits every time until I create a new snapshot?
-Does Whonix normally keep the same Tor nodes/circuits every start up or does it establish new ones each start?
-Would it be advised to restart/reload Tor on each bootup of the cloned Gateway, or would that serve no purpose?
-Any other potential risks anyone can think of to this kind of setup?

Sorry if I am misunderstanding how something operates, this stuff is tricky for me.</description>

            <p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Most of your questions still apply, I think. As far of as Tor is concerned certainly.</p>
<p>Appreciated also if you left a link here once posted and/or share relevant results.</p>

            <p>Yes, I think it makes sense. The links you posted explains well.</p>
<p>I think I had the idea Whonix configured the Tor scripts a certain way each boot. I’m trying to think of how my question may still apply. I can’t really see how a VM cloned debian + tbb which reloads to the same snapshot each boot would be any more dangerous than a persistent volume of debian + tbb with a timesync implemented. I’ll try to think on it some more and pose it to tor help list if I can come up with something worthwhile.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Multifaceted questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a> applies.</p>
<p>Therefore I advice to wipe the “Whonix” specificness part from your questions and to rephrase these questions as system Tor and/or TBB in a VM questions. Then you can ask about this on the tor-talk mailing list. Does that make sense?</p>
<blockquote>-Does Whonix normally keep the same Tor nodes/circuits every start up or does it establish new ones each start?</blockquote>
Default mode.

<blockquote>-Would it be advised to restart/reload Tor on each bootup of the cloned Gateway, or would that serve no purpose?</blockquote>
Probably no purpose.
