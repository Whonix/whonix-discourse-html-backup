    <title>Baremetal Kicksecure installation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/baremetal-kicksecure-installation/9269</link>
    <description>To get right to it, I distro-morphed a bare metal Debian Buster, using XFCE. It is an Intel computer. I purged libreoffice, Firefox, and their leftover dependencies. No other packages were removed.

Installed kicksecure packages and metapackages (not hardened kernel or standalone additions like tirdad)
Networking broke after installing kicksecure-packages-dependencies-pre and kicksecure-network-conf. Was met with &quot;no route&quot; errors and NetworkManager could not recognize a connection. Recovered easily after rollback and restart.

apparmor-profile-everything broke lightdm.service and I could not boot into XFCE. The problem is caused by apparmor profile user.lib.xorg.Xorg. I had to remove it from the apparmor.d directory, beacause aa-disable and aa-complain gave errors when I tried to use them. Those errors mentioned init-systemd in /etc/apparmor.d/

Another issue was when I tried to remove the apparmor-profile-everything package, I found that it needs a file it just deleted to finish uninstalling. &quot;problem executing scripts dpkg::Post-Invoke &#39;/usr/lib/apparmor-profile-everything/grub-cfg: not found Sub-process returned an error code&quot; 

Otherwise, everything seems good. I&#39;m not done yet and I can probably follow up later as I make more progress.

Thank you for this project! Very good work!</description>

<p>Good idea. I changed some things before adding the repository on a previous attempt, and it led to conflicts.</p>
<p>Thanks for tip, but I installed this knowing Kicksecure isn’t ready for production. That’s why I reported my experience.</p>

            <p>distro-morphing might become <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Unsupported">unsupported</a> after a <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a> ISO gets available. There’s too much state on a user system that can lead to issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything">https://github.com/Whonix/apparmor-profile-everything</a> readme indeed doesn’t make it clear that it’s not stable yet. <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stay_Tuned">stay tuned</a></p>
<p>Until that improves, here’s the general rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Packages that are installed by default are considered to cause as little trouble as possible.</li>
<li>Packages that require manual installation are more likely to cause issues.</li>
<li>The more ready a package gets, the more documentation will be added to the wiki and we’ll be posting a <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/tag/testers-wanted">testers-wanted</a> blog post.</li>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. It’s hard for me to know the status of different packages. Information is not very centralized here.</p>

<p>Those aren’t meant to be allowed. If the attacker can just unload the MAC policy, it’d be useless.</p>
<p>There are boot parameters you can use to disable it properly.</p>
