    <title>https exit node SSL stripping?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/https-exit-node-ssl-stripping/15900</link>
    <description>When I set Tor Browser to Safest mode and go to websites that I know for a fact have https SSL certificates, very often (like 40% of the time) it will tell me that it&#39;s HTTP only, so I hit proceed.

Then once the site loads, it has a lock and appears to be a legit cert.

Is this SSL stripping of malicious exit nodes?  Why is it saying no HTTPS?</description>
