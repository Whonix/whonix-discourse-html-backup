    <description>IDK if this can provide marginal security until full reproducible builds are possible:

&gt; 
&gt; [GitBOM](https://gitbom.dev/) is relatively new project to enable build tools trace every source file that is incorporated into build artifacts. As an experiment and/or proof-of-concept, the GitBOM developers are rebuilding Debian to generate side-channel build metadata for versions of Debian that have already been released. This only works because Debian is (partial) reproducible, so one can be sure that that, if the case where build artifacts are identical, any metadata generated during these instrumented builds applies to the binaries that were built and released in the past. More information on their approach is available in [`README` file in the *bomsh* repository](https://github.com/git-bom/bomsh#Reproducible-Build-and-Bomsh).</description>
