            <p>Compartmentalization by using everything inside virtual machines is good a good level of defense to prevent hardware being compromised. However, it’s not a 100% protection. If the malware can break out of the VM, it can still permanently infect the hardware.</p>
<p>And once the hardware is infected, conceptually VMs can’t help anymore.</p>
<p>This is indeed a very undesirable state of affairs.</p>
<p>Joanna - if I got her right - is proposing to make the hardware stateless, which means everything, BIOS, keyboard firmware, and so forth should be read-only. I think ideally hardware write protection switches would be ideal. Then we could get rid of malware by formatting the disk after booting from trusted read-only boot medium (dvd or so).</p>
<p>Some more information here:<br>

<p>It doesn’t exist yet. It’s up to hardware vendors to follow this very reasonable advice or to support Open Hardware (hardware that is Libre Software). The former is probably very unlikely.</p>

            <p>thank you ego.<br>
As seen that  the malware  today are  becaming always more and more  sofisticated,  using a  separate virtual machines not  internet connected to the OS, will be sufficient in  order to avoid  to get a BIOS malware?<br>
Basically: Is  it the virtual machine a good way to download from internet without  to be compromized  by  malware  or  bios malware?</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>absolutely not. There is no software in the world (accessible to the public) that could do something like this successfully. In very rare cases, flashing a new BIOS from a secure source MIGHT help, though often this is not the case, because if the BIOS is compromised, often even the small 2mb flash in notebook keyboards and other rather unknown “memory’s” on the mainboard get compromised.</p>
<p>So, if you even suspect that your BIOS is/has been compromised, your best course of action would be throwing the PC away.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
