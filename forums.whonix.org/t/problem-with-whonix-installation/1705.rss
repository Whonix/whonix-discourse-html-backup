    <description>Sorry for the newbee question, maybe it has been already posted but i can&#39;t understand something about Whonix. 
I have downloaded the .ova images, then  i have imported them in virtual box.   When i try to start both Whonix workstation and whonix gatwey i arrive at some  point when it says to me : &#39;&#39;user:  user... password: changeme&#39;&#39;
I log  in as user,  and  i use the password &#39;&#39;changeme&#39;&#39;, then ok, i am logged in but nothing happens.  It says to me &#39;&#39;type &#39;&#39;whonix  help&#39;&#39;...  if you want to be promped to the back  feel  free  to press enter&#39;&#39;
I can&#39;t not load sistem and nothing  happens.</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>if you lower the RAM this much, you’ll enter the “non-gui” mode, which is soley based on the terminal. So that you are not seeing a GUI is actually supposed to happen. Furthermore, 800mb really is too low, since this memory would be shared over two VMs and the host and seeing how long there have been no PCs with this little RAM, I have to presume the rest of your hardware won’t be capable enough as well.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick, no, i have changed anything in the virtualbox, except  for the basic memory o the virtual box. I changed it to 128 MGB according to the Whonix agreement.</p>
<p>Whonix  agreement says:  ‘‘if you have less than 2Gb of RAM in your host pc,  set  the memory of 128MGB  into the  virtual machine settings’’.</p>
<p>I have  a pc with  800 MGB  of RAM.   Can i still  run whonix?<br>
I don’t  think so, because actually i am not able to virtualize  whonix  with my 800 MGB ram pc.<br>
So i am asking to you,  an host  with 800 Mb of RAM, is too less to run Whonix?</p>

            <p>Did you change any VirtualBox settings during or after import? Don’t reduce RAM settings too much. Otherwise no desktop environment will start.</p>
