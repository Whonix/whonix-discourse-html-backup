    <title>Recent News About Spectre - Google Researchers Assessments</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/recent-news-about-spectre-google-researchers-assessments/6873</link>
    <description>I came across an article at Ars Technica [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/google-software-is-never-going-to-be-able-to-fix-spectre-type-bugs/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/google-software-is-never-going-to-be-able-to-fix-spectre-type-bugs/) detailing a paper by Google researchers mentioning that the Spectre vulnerability that affects all modern processors seem to have no software defenses in some cases. 

From the article:

&gt; And whatever the cost, the researchers continue, the software will be inadequate—**some Spectre flaws don&#39;t appear to have any effective software-based defense**.

I recommend checking out the article. Definitely a security related issue.</description>

            <p>You are better off reading the official code commits on the kernel list and the research papers yourself rather than some vague sentence in a tech tabloid.</p>
