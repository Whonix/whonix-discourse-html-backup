    <title>Workstation turned off in the middle of a Tor Browser session</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/workstation-turned-off-in-the-middle-of-a-tor-browser-session/2040</link>
    <description>I was using Tor Browser within a Whonix Workstation, but then the program and the VM itself froze in the middle of what I was doing, so I had to turn off the machine. Does turning off the machine in the middle of a Tor Browsing session cause problems suck as IP Address leaks? 

(Also, The host machine was never turned off and the Whonix Gateway was never turned off).

By the way, I&#39;m actually the user Dgjhpbn2, but whenever I entered my password it said &quot;incorrect password&quot; -- I reset the password using my email, but after 5 attempts the email never arrived, thus meaning I am currently locked out of that account with no way to get back into it.</description>
