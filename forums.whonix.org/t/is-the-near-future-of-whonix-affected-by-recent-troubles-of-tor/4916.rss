    <title>Is the near future of Whonix affected by recent troubles of tor?</title>

    <description>It seems like tor stopped playing nice with certain Linux kernels. Transparent proxying, which seems to be a very important feature, have stopped working. For example see these bug reports:

https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25380
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/25401

Does this have any impact on Whonix?</description>

            <p>The bug on Tor bug tracker was marked as won’t fix, since it looks like Tor devs preferred to shift the trouble to the Linux kernel.</p>

            <p>Debian stable doesn’t include either kernel version so it should be fixed long before it could affect us.</p>
