    <title>ADD_ONION via Control Port (onion-grater)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/add-onion-via-control-port-onion-grater/9393</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to use the ADD_ONION command on Whonix-Workstation. Can someone please write the onion-grater configuration rule that would allow that? Thanks in advance!

Are there any security concerns for the ADD_ONION? I&#39;m only interested in adding an ephemeral service that would last for only a couple of days.

I saw in the Docs that there&#39;s a 128 character limitation for commands. As ADD_ONION requires the whole private key to be submitted, 128 chars would not be sufficient. It says it&#39;s configurable, but I can&#39;t see that. Thanks!</description>

</blockquote>
<p>There are many examples using <code>ADD_ONION</code> here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/onion-grater/tree/master/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/Whonix/onion-grater/tree/master/usr/share/doc/onion-grater-merger/examples</a></p>
<p>Tails might have other onion-grater profiles which could be useful for<br>
inspiration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there any security concerns for the ADD_ONION?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a write-up about onion-grater security, see:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Onion-grater-warning" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Onion-grater-warning</a></p>
<p>And on onion services security, this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I saw in the Docs that there’s a 128 character limitation for commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is likely outdated since ADD_ONION is fully functional.</p>
