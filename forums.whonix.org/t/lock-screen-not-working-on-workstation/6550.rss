            <p>Locking your VM screen will have negligible security benefits. If someone had access to the host without screen lock it would it would be simple matter to gain access to the VM. However, it can’t hurt to lock both VM and host if that is what you want to do.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>Dulc3Maria</code></p>
<p>No problem, keep in mind that FDE is only a benefit when the Host is shutdown. So it is recommended that the host be shutdown if you intend to leave it unattended.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>Dulc3Maria</code></p>
<p>This is not a bug. The sreen lock for Whonix VMs are not configured because there would be no security benefit.  Anyone that has access to a running host (i.e. a machine on which a virtual machine runs) without its screen lock, would have full access to the Virtual machines whether or not the Whonix VM screenlock in enabled.  Since Whonix is not a multi-user OS you should use Full Disk Encryption on the host.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Full_Disk_Encryption_on_the_Host">https://whonix.org/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Full_Disk_Encryption_on_the_Host</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Encrypted guest images (Whonix VMs)  is experimental and <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Unsupported">Unsupported</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Encrypted_Guest_Images">https://whonix.org/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption_and_Encrypted_Images#Encrypted_Guest_Images</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If you still would like to configure screen the answer can likely be found as per: <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle">https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle</a></p>
<p>Since Whonix is based on Debian, you might want to search how to enable screen  lock in Debian. You might also have to disable auto-login. It will require editing this file.</p>
<p>In Whonix-Workstation konsole, run.</p>
<p><code>cat /etc/login.defs</code></p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>To lock screen on the host:</p>
