    <title>Unable to update Whonix VirtualBox 15.0.0.4.9</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/unable-to-update-whonix-virtualbox-15-0-0-4-9/8093</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, firstly thanks so much for everything you do. I&#39;m having trouble updating the virtualbox version of whonix (I&#39;ve had this trouble with previous version also.)

Whonixcheck always fails to download updates. I&#39;ve tried, no kidding, probably 10-15 times, including with many times with fresh imports of the .ova. This happens in both gateway and workstation.

If I try to update &quot;manually&quot; using the terminal, there are many errors there also.

Here is the most common error I encounter:

    E: Failed to fetch tor+https://cdn-aws.deb.debian.org/debian/dists/buster/main/by-hash/SHA256/b406b8eca3f17b15ba9c54801cc85fa4773c560a0703ef1963d787f53054fdd3  Hash Sum mismatch

Other errors may have occurred but these are the only one I can reproduce at the time.

I&#39;ve tried cleaning apt packages with

    apt-get clean
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

And no luck.

I&#39;ve tried updating with new tor nodes (via &quot;n&quot; key in nyx) and this doesn&#39;t seem to help. (tried many times)

I&#39;ve even tried &quot;onionizing&quot; the debian and whonix repositories with the instructions from the wiki.

What am I doing wrong??

Any help is very very very appreciated. I want to run Whonix, but I believe for the most secure experience it should be updated.</description>

            <p>Can’t see any mistake on your side.</p>
<p>I don’t have an explanation.</p>
<p>Normally I would think, this isn’t a compromise indicator since attackers who could cause such bugs would usually want to stay undetected (and can avoid detection through such means easily) as per:</p>

<p>I hope it’s not that and has some simple technical reason which I don’t know. Sorry that I don’t have any better answer.</p>
