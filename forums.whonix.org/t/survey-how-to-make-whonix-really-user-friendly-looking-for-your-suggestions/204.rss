    <description>[html]&lt;h4&gt;Future Directions – Where Whonix wants to be in 2 or 5 years?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we want Whonix to be for average users or just for those with unix knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whonix is a useful tool for some already, got many fans. How can we make Whonix really user friendly to allow mass adaption by regular people who need anonymity most?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, Whonix limits itself by its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/w/images/9/90/Whonix.jpg&quot;&gt;two machines design&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not exactly simple and user friendly to say “you first need to get VirtualBox, then import these two VMs, then start Whonix-Gateway, then start Whonix-Workstation or use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation&quot;&gt;physical isolation&lt;/a&gt;“. How could that be improved while keeping Whonix’s design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last days many had great ideas. One was to create a hardware appliance. Whonix running as physically isolated gateway running on devices such as Raspberry PI or OpenWRT or creating a Tor WiFi Hotspot (a WiFi hotspot once using it, torifying the whole connection). The issue is, having a “route everything through Tor” approach alone doesn’t make it anymore nowadays. If someone would run their usual applications, such as their Firefox or Internet Explorer browser they used for non-anonymous stuff beforehand over Tor, they wouldn’t be anonymous at all due to (flash) cookies, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/&quot;&gt;browser fingerpriting&lt;/a&gt; and so forth. Saying “plug this hardware appliance between your router and your computer AND install this client package” also doesn’t sound exactly simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another idea was to create a Whonix Live DVD. But even if we managed to create one, it would still be clumsy to say “you have to burn this iso to DVD, then boot it, then start Whonix-Gateway, then start Whonix-Workstation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Ayala suggested to create an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,205.0.html&quot;&gt;Whonix USB installer&lt;/a&gt;. It would still be clumsy (as above), but installing Whonix would get simpler and more encouraging to use a non-Windows, separate operating system. We then would have to support lots of different hardware, but additional support by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,201.0.html&quot;&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; this would be possible. Users still would have to figure out how to boot from USB, which is not entirely trivial due to different BIOS implementations. Also “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Secure_boot_criticism&quot;&gt;secure boot&lt;/a&gt;” won’t make this simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerberus raised the idea to make Whonix fully managed. Perhaps he meant to enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Automatic_Updates&quot;&gt;automatic updates&lt;/a&gt; for the host, Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. Whonix-Gateway could then be fully managed and hidden from non-advanced users. However, there are some settings that need to be set up on Whonix-Gateway, such as settings for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Bridges&quot;&gt;Tor bridges&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe a Whonix-Host operating system could ssh into Whonix-Gateway to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe while we’re at discussing a Whonix-Host operating system, we should revive the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OneVM&quot;&gt;OneVM&lt;/a&gt; concept? In essence, we’re shipping Whonix-Gateway as VM package, because it is a simpler and more robust implementation to support a variety of different host operating systems and configurations. As long as Whonix doesn’t provide a host operating system, the two VM solution is more robust. But if Whonix is enters the next stage of evolution, i.e. by shipping a host operating system, the OneVM concept may work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea to add Whonix to the usual app stores, such as Windows / Mac app store as well as “sudo apt-get install whonix” has been raised as well. This wouldn’t make Whonix less clumsy (still two VMs), but it would make installation simpler and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, we’re not sure yet where the journey should go to. We’d appreciate the input of the community. Please share ideas on how Whonix could become really usable while not sacrificing security.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Yes, I saw the convo about disabling JS.</p>
<p>Maybe on the whonix landing page in ToprBrowser, there could be a note or link to quickly and easily add Whonix Forum Search to list of browser search providers. I find it very useful for quickly finding solutions to Whonix problems.</p>

<p>Too long list , not used by all users.</p>
<p>i think the vision of Whonix goals should be the simplest best programs for anonymity.</p>
<p>e.g for not useful choices:-</p>
<p>signal-desktop = very bad app for anonymity , not even customized for it. kinda good with seucrity.</p>
<p>e.g for Debatable choices (ofcourse not recommended to add all of them)</p>
<p>Riot or Tox or Ring ?</p>
<p>e.g for not useful for all users</p>
<p>all cryptocurrencies services</p>
<p>e.g for not ready yet to use apps for anonymity</p>
<p>TorMessenger -&gt; Still Beta</p>
<p>BitMessage -&gt; Still Beta , not active sine 2 years</p>
<p>…etc</p>
<p>these choices r not recommended to be install as default applications, but sure any user can use them inside whonix by his choice.</p>
<p>Whonix vision for the applications:-</p>
<p>1- must be installed through debian package</p>
<p>2- active and stable development</p>
<p>3- meant to be for anonymous communications</p>
<p>4- no fishy company/developers behind it</p>
<p>5- for sure it must be fully opened source with source code availability</p>

<p>A small recommendation: Add ‘Whonix Forums Search’ (v3) to TorBrowser’s search providers.</p>
<p>(For a user, it is as easy as navigating to forum, clicking search icon, and then clicking the green plus sign in the Tor Browser search bar, to add it as a provider.)</p>
<p>This has the obvious advantage of making it that much easier to find support (I know the landing page for torbrowser has a link to forum).</p>
<p>Also, this adds a layer of security, searching the v3 onion directly. Rather than possibly using google, or duckduckgo’s clearnet search.</p>
<p>As far as recommendations for 2019 (5 years from OP). . .</p>
<p>personally, I would like a lighter install, without KDE, and something more along the lines of a net install, with the ability to add packages at install time.</p>
<p>You could have your bare metal base version, and then your fully loaded user friendly version with all the defaults installed.</p>
<p>For the fully loaded version, here are a list of some of my installed packages:</p>
<p>localepurge<br>
debfoster<br>
deborphan<br>
bleachbit<br>
MAT</p>
<p>geany<br>

BitWarden</p>
<p>Signal-Desktop<br>

OpenBazaar 2.1</p>
<p>Electrum Bitcoin Wallet<br>
Electrum Litecoin Wallet<br>
Electrum Cash Wallet (BCH)<br>
Monero (GUI)<br>
ZCashd</p>
<p>I would also like to see Namecoin integration wherever possible.</p>
<p>I know zuluCrypt has been discussed, which I have installed but haven’t used. But I really like Tomb, and would love to see it packaged with Whonix.</p>
<p>Also, Cryptomator + Nextcloud is really useful for keeping folders sync’d across multiple Workstations.</p>

            <p>User friendliness should not be the goal, rather thorough documentation should be the goal.  Whatever technology has the best documentation thrives.  Example: Arch Linux is so well documented its becoming its own standard amongst the Linux community, Debian is another example, packing great documentation, its probably running most of the worlds servers, as well as being the foundation of almost every major linux distro!  Projects that do not provide excellent documentation are the ones that fall off the map.  Dont cater to user friendliness, rather make the user knowledgable of the technology with excellent documentation, then the technology is friendly to them.</p>

            <p>when i first heared i thought that the whonix workstation runs inside the whonix gateway. its maybe not as flexible as other setups but its a simple one and it allows to ship as 1 file. nested vms can also have a security advantage if 2 different virtualization tools are bing used.</p>

<p>(I’m learning! probably sudo is not even needed for dist-upgrade but hey it’s improving.)</p>
<p>It means grandpa only has to double-click on it, be prompted for password by the nice friendly kde window, watch the terminal text zoom past and learn something, and just let it do its thing until it automatically closes off – but of course, you’d be able to make an even nicer GUI progress bar tool for updating that doesn’t even show the terminal!</p>

            <p>How are you posting as Guest? Its cool and I wanna do the same.</p>
<p>Whonix resolution is standard for all versions so it shouldn’t leak the host screen size. The resolution info leak should be fixed by TorProject devs by now.</p>
<p>Anonymous bug reporting is an interesting idea. Tails has it under a feature called WhisperBack. Maybe porting it over to Whonix won’t be hard.</p>

            <p>[html]</p><p>Oh, me again, with another small friendly suggestion! You can also double click on titlebar to maximize too, not good for accidental use by a ‘mainstream’ non-technical user and they don’t realise they have a highly unique fingerprint for the rest of that browsing session! (which since this is a persistent vm, could be for a very long time, weeks even – longer, if they ‘save state’ when closing and whonix never needs to be restarted!) I think TBB resets window size when starting up (and probably with ‘New Identity’) but still…it can happen, and it’s an anonymity liability!</p>
<p>So: System Settings, Windows Behavior, Window Behavior, Titlebar Actions, Titlebar double-click: set it to nothing by default!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>[html]</p><p>I’ve got one small idea to help usability – as I’m setting up Whonix for my folks (where I don’t live) so I can then communicate with them anonymously and they can browse freely on sensitive subjects also!</p>
<p>This is it:</p>
<p>The update steps (apt-get) in konsole are a bit much for a windows-usually, 60-something technoklutz! How about including a one-click shortcut with a big nice ‘Update Whonix’ and icon on the Desktop, and instead of (only) giving scary unintelligible instructions to do those commands like WhonixCheck currently instructs, instead say: ‘Updates found! Click on ‘Download Updates’ on the Desktop to stay secure! (Advanced users: do .)’?</p>
<p>I’ve set a simple shortcut to a sh script just doing:</p>
<p>kdesudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; kdesudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y</p>
<p>And all it does it gui-prompt for password after clicking on it once! Ease of use indeed will increase security for the mainstream, and anonymity for us ALL – the more people can use Tor and Whonix and encryption and all these tools, the better for all of us and the harder for those who want to take our rights away!</p>
<p>(Btw I’m new to linux too so probably aren’t using state-of-the-art syntax back there :P)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for everything you do with Whonix Patrick – it is a just amazing and essential tool for anonymous Internetting!</p>
<p>Btw, is there some ‘whonix suggestion box’ that one can submit simple but useful (anonymous) suggestions for improving the security/privacy/usability of Whonix for dev consideration?</p>
<p>I know thre’s the forum, the wiki and github, but I mean something that doesn’t require an account – just a ‘dropbox’ for sharing helpful suggestions with a simple text submit form and begrudging captcha if need be.</p>
<p>Cos I’ve got another one, and I’m sure I’d have more in the future as I get used to whonix! and that is, removing the maximize button in kde settings, so the user (e.g. your technoklutz folks), can’t accidentally maximize TBB and suddenly make their fingerprint INSANELY unique (cos ofc, it’s too hard to expect not to use JS when they browse! I will, but not having a maximize button by default will help retain anonymity – and power users can always manually resize a window anyway, or add the button back of course!)</p>
<p>Yours,
</p><p>Anonymous</p><br>

            <p>[html]</p><p>In my opinion, the most user friendly way of doing something like this would be hardware only.</p>
<p>I imagine something like a hdmi minipc (or USBstick) plugged into a pc and making the gateway work.</p>
<p>Then the user would have to make all coms (cable our wifi) go through that gateway that would install (and look) as a usb network card.</p>
<p>The only device the I know may resemble my suggestion is this one:  <a href="http://info-android.com/upload/posts/41/97/2358/11e853fcb195286a95eb0c078bffc11a62e2a894.jpg">http://info-android.com/upload/posts/41/97/2358/11e853fcb195286a95eb0c078bffc11a62e2a894.jpg</a></p>
<p>but the HDMI plug should be a USB witch is not just an hardware issue.</p>
<p>This way the two-machines-design is kept only they no longer are virtual.</p>
<p>You may guess I am not an expert, and I am not, this is just a suggestion.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Many interesting opinions until now. To give the future of whonix a direction, I think  you have to take a look from all perspectives: the users, the people offering whonix based services, the providers of other tor based solutions and maybe even the authorities.</p>
<p>The users might be the biggest group, people who want to profit from privacy in their more or less honest or legal interest. So greater their need, so bigger the effort they are willing to take. So for the masses the simple tbb or tails are first choice, as you can quickly use them when needed and then change back to normal life - until somebody uses whonix there has to a really professional or ideological need.<br>
None of these examples from above finally represents a desktop os for daily use (that could convince users for that reason), only Qubes takes a very interesting approach in that direction. Finally the user is the weakest point in the equation, most people simply don’t care about or are not aware of privacy, or consider any effort to protect their privacy as useless anyway.<br>
In order to change this whonix has to be or a quick and easy to use solution, or an integrated part of a desktop os (here I talk again about Qubes, forgive me). Even if one of these two ways can be done, there is still missing a corresponding public appearance of whonix as a solution (product).</p>
<p>Second I mentioned the people offering services. The usability of whonix for hosting is practically very low, though technically advanced. It seems to me like building an armored pickup with Ferrari technology - but there are no highways to drive it and let’s pray that no part will ever break. Last but not least there is no clue if you ever drive it safely when it’s loaded… so the step using kvm is extremely important.<br>
Combining this with the user subject, there remains the missing infrastructure - and that would require management. There is missing everything that would make using tor/whonix attractive (besides the dark or legal reasons for privacy). To explain this furthermore would take to long here, still the main reason for that is the lack of opportunities for making profit because of the missing infrastructure. OK, now there is bitcoins and many others, but how about social networking, email, hosting and everything else that makes the web so attractive?<br>
Finally the technology that could be used over the TN already exists: additional protocols, encrypted clouds and I even succeeded to use multipath tcp over tor - the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>As a conclusion I would draw the following image of whonix for a bright future: simplify it dramatically or integrate it with other projects (bundle resources), design and implement the technology for an extended user experience (whonix network;) and offer a commercial solution package (this alone is a highly delicate and complex subject, I will no go further into it now).<br>
Maybe it sounds like SF to you - desn’t to me <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Providing multiple versions, each for particular users and applications, would be best, I believe. The current OVA version is fine for users who use VMs, or are willing to learn. And the current “build it yourself version” is fine for those with middling Linux skills. But that leaves out potential users who find Tails, or even TBB, too complicated.</p>
<p>I don’t like TBB, because I think that it puts clueless Windows and OS X users at risk. It’s not at all configured for other apps, but it doesn’t prevent them from running, or (as far as I know) even warn users. Tails is also somewhat problematic, because there’s no Tor-userland barrier, and it’s all too easy to save insecurely on USB flash drives.</p>
<p>As I’ve written in &lt; <a href="https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,65.msg1719.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,65.msg1719.html</a> &gt;, I would love to see a LiveDVD version of Whonix. I believe that it’s doable, and with luck I’ll have a crude hack working within a week or so.</p>

<p>What is the idea behind using d-i installer for Whonix? Installing Debian &amp; VB and then loading the images?</p>

</aside>
<p>There is a link on the documentation page labeled “Manually Create Whonix VM Settings, in case you want to restore a backup of .vdi hard disk image files” and linking to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Manually_Create_Whonix_VM_Settings">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Manually_Create_Whonix_VM_Settings</a>. Similar instructions would be required when installing using d-i (debian-like installer iso). I don’t think saying “install that iso”, then open a terminal and do ‘VBoxManage setextradata “yourvmname” “VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/GetHostTimeDisabled” “1”’ etc. would be simpler than using the ova import method.</p>

            <p>Hi everybody.</p>
<p>Alternative to the best possible solution.</p>
<p>Best ‘plug and play’ solution ‘on offer’ without having to change habits in a serious way.</p>
<p>I’m a newbie and knowledge of security is rather low, I’m overwhelmed by all the possibilities where things could go wrong in terms of perfect privacy. Ideal for me and probably the other 99% of us, being non-techies, would be the above mentioned appliance-route. I already have an appliance which is an mailserver with auto-encryption therefore no gpg related stuff on my desktop, works like a charm.<br>
Leave my desktop ‘as is’, eventually advice what pre-configured browser to use to enhance matters. It wouldn’t be perfect, but it would be an great enhancement over the current no-privacy at all situation, I think.<br>
How bad is this idea, love to get some feedback.</p>

            <p>A couple of remarks.</p>
<p>Whatever the success of Whonix (or Tails, or Liberte Linux) as an anonymisation system, unless Tor becomes so widely used that the majority of the sites could not afford to ban it, we will still need an easy access to the clearnet for everyday tasks like banking, social relationships (relatives, girlfriends/boyfriends, local community, sports if you are interested…). I do not include Facebook that I don’t use because I don’t believe the birth of my nth kid is a global issue, amongst other things.</p>
<p>In this light, for the “average” user, until Whonix-KVM is up and running, the current Whonix implementation seems the best one. Of course, if you can provide an installer that would take care of Debian, VirtualBox and the virtual machines, it might help enlarging the user base. If achievable, that is probably a lot of work.</p>
<p>As you mentioned somewhere, Patrick, Tails is more aimed at the mobile market. You visit North Korea, take your Tails USB key in the pocket, it is totally amnesic, there is no evidence against you (well, perhaps North Korea is not the perfect scenario… :-).</p>
<p>Qubes OS is definitely security oriented, with the applications running in their own isolated domains. As for anonymity, I am wondering. First of all, I do not know how some of the developers see their own future, but I suspect there are spotlights in the picture. Not a criticism, but… Secondly, if the domains are security isolated, as far as I understand, there is no stream isolation. Running the TorVM domain along with the Thunderbird and/or XChat domains comes to the same as running Tor and Icedove-XChat together in Debian.</p>
<p>As for usability, try to install an HVM and connect it to the network. It is far from being an easy step. Installing a virtual image is a whole different story, I gave up, too quickly may be (it’s  personal, but I do not feel at ease in this environment, and it’s a good enough reason).</p>
<p>There is another alternative, booting Xen in Debian. The installation is easy, and It seems they have made some good progress with the network issues in xend, by implementing xl, as a user choice in the current version 4.1, and as the default toolstack from the upcoming one, Xen 4.2. I am looking into it.</p>

            <p>Here is my opinion. It may be biased of course as a KVM helper, but nonetheless hear me out.</p>
<p>Whonix IMO serves a dual role. For the first one, it is in our best interest to cater to the casual user - within limits as they really need some basic understanding of how virtualization works. The reason is strategic. A large and diverse userbase provides a large anonymity set for vulnerable people to hide in, so that downloading Whonix does not automatically become a redflag. With time the fan base may itself evangelize and bring in some knowledgeable hackers to help or they themselves can try to self-educate so they can be able to contribute something.</p>
<p>If the Linux community decided to give up on the desktop initiative and abandon GUIs and DEs, people like you and me wouldn’t be using it today. So it is essential to keep them in mind. However I don’t think virtualization could get any easier than VirtualBox.</p>
<p>The OneVM is not safe I think, because the direct baremetal becomes a variable. If someone’s host becomes infected by an adversary smart enough or with enough resources, this is guaranteed to be a permanent breach of anonymity. With access to the underlying hardware, disinfecting a machine or hiding from its webcam or microphone becomes essentially impossible. Of course software like VirtualBox finds it necessary to expose your webcam in a vm anyway which makes it useless in high-sec situations.</p>
<p>The second role is one mentioned in the front page and I believe is more important. Setting up Tor hidden services. Anyone knowledgeable enough to setup a hidden service is most likely using a free software base and is therefore a Linux user who will want to use KVM for best security and flexibility. Normal Linux desktop users who appreciate security and software freedom will take this as the obvious choice.</p>

            <p>With unlimited resources, we could provide all these great options. But with no funding and Patrick working his day job as part of the German version of Chippendales (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippendales">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippendales</a>), we need to make decisions.</p>
<p>I believe we should prioritize based on:<br>
Lower difficulty of use<br>
Lower difficulty of implementation<br>
Higher security</p>
<p>These are conflicting needs, of course. And I haven’t even prioritized these priorities!</p>
<p>And so, the option/form/implementation (we need a name) of Whonix that we work on should, ideally, be in a “sweet spot” of good usability, not to burdensome difficulty for us, but at least low to medium security.</p>
<p>I’m going to propose something: We don’t focus first on the use case where Tails is already quite strong. That would be the low skill, medium security, “low needs” (my term; not much more than a web browser) group.</p>
<p>But to argue against myself: It’s interesting to note that a Mac/Windows installer could make us easier to use than Tails, and that could be huge.</p>
