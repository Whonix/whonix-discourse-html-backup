    <description>I have a few Debian Jessie vm&#39;s connected to the Whonix gateway, but after having cloned one of the vms the network connections from all the Debian Jessie machines to the whonix gateway broke. I can remember I checked `reinitialize the mac address of all network cards`, maybe this does have something to do with it.

This is my `/etc/network/interfaces` in my Debian machines, network manager is uninstalled, used to work perfectly:

&gt; auto lo
&gt; iface lo inet loopback
&gt; 
&gt; auto eth0
&gt; iface eth0 inet static
&gt;       address 10.152.152.15
&gt;       netmask 255.255.192.0
&gt;       gateway 10.152.152.10

The Debian Jessie VM has 1 adapter: `PCnet-FAST ||| (Internal Network, &#39;Whonix&#39;)`


This is my `/etc/network/interfaces` (without comments) in the Whonix Gateway:

&gt; auto lo
&gt; iface lo inet loopback
&gt; 
&gt; auto eth0
&gt; iface eth0 inet dhcp
&gt; 
&gt; auto eth1
&gt; iface eth1 inet static
&gt;       address 10.152.152.10
&gt;       netmask 255.255.192.0

Whonix gateway has 2 adapters:
- `PCnet-FAST ||| (NAT)`
- `PCnet-FAST ||| (Internal Network, &#39;Whonix&#39;)`

Strange thing is, the Whonix workstation that is also connected to the same gateway continues to work, while several linux machines that used to work in the past don&#39;t anymore. 

What else is the Whonix Gateway doing to make internal network connections possible? What options do I have left to troubleshoot this problem? Or have I maybe uncovered a bug in Virtualbox?</description>

            <p>My case was caused by allocating too less memory (128M), which cuased gateway killing Tor process.<br>
Looks like when more workstations use gateway it need more memory.<br>
256M solved the issue.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I was asking about whether running one CUSTOM workstation alone works. Would you mind trying?</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

<p>Is /etc/network/interfaces identical in all of your Debian VMs?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They are not identical, the mac addresses are also all different. However, upon checking this, one of the vm’s network is still functioning. I think I hit a bug which probably takes too much time to figure out. I’m going to recreate the other ones with the one that’s still working.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help guys!</p>

            <p>Strange enough no. Workstation keeps working. That’s why I’m posting maybe there’s something Whonix does that is different then the jessie vm’s.</p>
