    <description>As you may have noticed, the spammers have gotten more and more clever, so we have had to make some adjustments.

For the time being, new page creation is disabled for anonymous and regular registered users. However, translation requires the ability to create new pages. To quell the spam, we are going to grant the &quot;translator&quot; group to individuals who request it.

I know it&#39;s a little bit of a hassle, but it should be a one-time obstacle.

Thanks to all current translators, and thanks to all future ones!</description>
