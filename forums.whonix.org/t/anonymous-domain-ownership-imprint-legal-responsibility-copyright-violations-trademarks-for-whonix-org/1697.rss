    <description>Continuing the discussion from [using logos for Whonix discourse forum categories](https://forums.whonix.org/t/using-logos-for-whonix-discourse-forum-categories/1686/20) where legal, licensing, trademark issues with images came up.

shift the domain ownership to anonymous person that u know or someone like my case (his country doesnt care for copyrights another examples like africa or india ..etc). or shift it to anonymous fake member (doesnt even exist). :innocent:

I think it would be ideal to go for a multi layered defense. As the first thing complying with all legal requirements. This is good as one line and defense. And prevents other types of conflicts. Violating other peoples virtual rights. Not making them angry. Not generating hate and badmouthing.

As a second line of defense however, such - to be researched - legally allowed by possibilities within the law to shift legal responsibility to people where less draconian laws apply is attractive.

&gt; shift the domain ownership to anonymous person that u know or someone like my case (his country doesnt care for copyrights another examples like africa or india ..etc).

Domain ownership is crucial. The one who owns the domain could get innocently hacked and lose domain ownership. Or bribe the real users of the domain (the Whonix team) to sell it to the most bidding seller.

&gt; or shift it to anonymous fake member (doesnt even exist).

This is problematic, because then in cases such as unlawful domain shut down, there would be no one to represent the case in the legal system.

The following website has an interesting imprint:
http://www.freiwilligfrei.info/impressum

They are using the http://www.deuru.com imprint service.

* http://www.deuru.com/unser-angebot
* http://www.deuru.com/wie-funktioniert-unser-service
* http://www.deuru.com/faq

The page is German only, and this whole topic is very specific to German laws.

I would trust them with the imprint service, but it is an incomplete solution.

Quote http://www.deuru.com/faq

&gt; Ich bin bei der Denic als Seiteninhaber eingetragen. kann ich dadurch abgemahnt werden?

&gt; Ja! Obwohl Sie ja Ihre Verantwortung vertraglich ausgelagert haben bleiben Sie der Domain Inhaber. Der kann laut Landgericht Hamburg abgemahnt werden. Allerdings erst nachdem er von dem Abmahnungsgrund Kenntnis hat.&gt; Dagegen hilft unser Angebot auch die Domain ins Ausland auszulagern. Sie bleiben trotzdem der Besitzer der Domain.

In summary, freely translated: &quot;Even if you are using the imprint service, the owner of the domain can still be sued for violations of third parties.&quot;

Quote http://www.deuru.com/rechtsverletzung-dritter

&gt; Deswegen bietet DEURU auch gegen eine geringe Gebühr die Übernahme 
Ihrerer Domain an eine ausländische Adresse an. Die Domaine bleibt vertraglich
 Ihre Domain als Admin C. Der Besitzer wird ausgelagert und fällt dann 
nicht mehr unter das deutsche Gesetz. Dies kann auch sehr kurzfristig 
geschehen. Auch dann wenn gerade wie im vorgenannten Fall eine Abmahnung
 droht.

In summary, freely translated: &quot;Against a small fee, we would host your domain under a foreign postal address. You would stay the Domain Admin C. Then German laws would no longer apply.&quot;

However, http://www.internetrecht-rostock.de/admin-c-kostenhaftung.htm disagrees, and says that also the Admin C is responsible.

Also the Admin C is not the owner of the domain. The owner of the domain could again, either be hacked and [temporarily] loose the domain or maliciously sell it to the most bidding buyer. Perhaps a contract could forbid that. But the value of a contract with someone in a country the take responsibility for the domain in the first place is worth zero once broken, because it cannot be legally enforced.

The only way out of this legal mess seems to me to transfer domain ownership to a trustworthy organization that offers such services [to Libre Software projects such as Whonix].</description>

<p>I’m not sure I can follow you on that. Transferring a domain to a person or organisation, that doesn’t exist is both highly illegal (the ICANN enforces this worldwide in every country, were they are responsible for TLDs) and serves no purpose, as, to put it quite simply, if the person representing the site doesn’t answer legal question and the person who claims their copyright was infringed goes to court, the first thing they’d be able to do, was get the hoster to take down the site. In case the site is hosted directly at Patricks home, it could even lead to a raid.</p>

<p>tho, if there is a guaranteed procedure; well this might be sound good.</p>

<p>Domain ownership is crucial. The one who owns the domain could get innocently hacked and lose domain ownership. Or bribe the real users of the domain (the Whonix team) to sell it to the most bidding seller.</p>

<p>hacking could happen in both cases, not a critical point. and i meant someone u know = which mean trust worthy person. not an advertiser.or even company like “freedom protecting rights” or even support “copy wrong” if any exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is problematic, because then in cases such as unlawful domain shut down, there would be no one to represent the case in the legal system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what would legal system do ? re-open the website if the FBI closed it ? fighting with us again the copy rights stuff ?</p>
<p>i think we should put to an end to one of them since it is impossible to deal with separated sides at the same time.</p>
<p>copy rights mean legal mean laws = direct fees , problems , jail , if u r going to break any of them. and if u r going to live under these rules = wont be much different from the life in jail; i wonder how would anyone want succeedness from that.</p>

<p>didnt cached this , transfer whonix domain ownership to whonix? <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<hr>
<p>i think the fastest good and guaranteed way to do this is to transfer the domain ownership to fake anonymous account.<br>
and also we can make an website inside the hidden services (just rubbish fixedl one no need activity inside it) , and we made it look like the main one and the clearnet stuff (forum , wiki …etc) r just a fork of the hidden one. so anyone having problems witha clearnet website he should contact the hidden one and the ownership = which both of them r unknown by any. so there will be no harmness nor laws. unless if they can break the hidden one. which is in our case kinda impossible. because we r the hidden services lovers <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I think it would be ideal to go for a multi layered defense. As the first thing complying with all legal requirements. This is good as one line and defense. And prevents other types of conflicts. Violating other peoples virtual rights. Not making them angry. Not generating hate and badmouthing.</p>
<p>As a second line of defense however, such - to be researched - legally allowed by possibilities within the law to shift legal responsibility to people where less draconian laws apply is attractive.</p>

<p>The following website has an interesting imprint:<br>
<a href="http://www.freiwilligfrei.info/impressum" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.freiwilligfrei.info/impressum</a></p>
<p>They are using the <a href="http://www.deuru.com">http://www.deuru.com</a> imprint service.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.deuru.com/unser-angebot">http://www.deuru.com/unser-angebot</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.deuru.com/wie-funktioniert-unser-service">http://www.deuru.com/wie-funktioniert-unser-service</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.deuru.com/faq">http://www.deuru.com/faq</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The page is German only, and this whole topic is very specific to German laws.</p>
<p>I would trust them with the imprint service, but it is an incomplete solution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ich bin bei der Denic als Seiteninhaber eingetragen. kann ich dadurch abgemahnt werden?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ja! Obwohl Sie ja Ihre Verantwortung vertraglich ausgelagert haben bleiben Sie der Domain Inhaber. Der kann laut Landgericht Hamburg abgemahnt werden. Allerdings erst nachdem er von dem Abmahnungsgrund Kenntnis hat.&gt; Dagegen hilft unser Angebot auch die Domain ins Ausland auszulagern. Sie bleiben trotzdem der Besitzer der Domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, freely translated: “Even if you are using the imprint service, the owner of the domain can still be sued for violations of third parties.”</p>
<p>Quote <a href="http://www.deuru.com/rechtsverletzung-dritter">http://www.deuru.com/rechtsverletzung-dritter</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deswegen bietet DEURU auch gegen eine geringe Gebühr die Übernahme<br>
Ihrerer Domain an eine ausländische Adresse an. Die Domaine bleibt vertraglich<br>
Ihre Domain als Admin C. Der Besitzer wird ausgelagert und fällt dann<br>
nicht mehr unter das deutsche Gesetz. Dies kann auch sehr kurzfristig<br>
geschehen. Auch dann wenn gerade wie im vorgenannten Fall eine Abmahnung<br>
droht.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, freely translated: “Against a small fee, we would host your domain under a foreign postal address. You would stay the Domain Admin C. Then German laws would no longer apply.”</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://www.internetrecht-rostock.de/admin-c-kostenhaftung.htm">http://www.internetrecht-rostock.de/admin-c-kostenhaftung.htm</a> disagrees, and says that also the Admin C is responsible.</p>
<p>Also the Admin C is not the owner of the domain. The owner of the domain could again, either be hacked and [temporarily] loose the domain or maliciously sell it to the most bidding buyer. Perhaps a contract could forbid that. But the value of a contract with someone in a country the take responsibility for the domain in the first place is worth zero once broken, because it cannot be legally enforced.</p>
<hr>
<p>The only way out of this legal mess seems to me to transfer domain ownership to a trustworthy organization that offers such services [to Libre Software projects such as Whonix].</p>
