    <title>Outbound mail issue on Forums (resolved)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/outbound-mail-issue-on-forums-resolved/5498</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Whilst doing some work hardening the server&#39;s firewall, I inadvertently caused a firewall issue which prevented the forum from sending (and possibly receiving) e-mail, such as notifications, password resets, etc, for about the last 20 hours.

The docker container that runs the Discourse app couldn&#39;t make certain outbound connections.

This has been resolved. ~~Unfortunately I don&#39;t think there was any &#39;backlog&#39; or queue of pending emails, they simply failed to send.~~ Actually, looks like delayed mail is starting to send after all.

Sorry about the disruption; for context, we&#39;re going through a bit of a busy period of making lots of improvements to the server, and, in what is a classic for a security-focused project, sometimes we make things a little &#39;too&#39; secure :sweat_smile:</description>
