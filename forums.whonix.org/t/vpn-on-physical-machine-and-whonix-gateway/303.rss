    <title>VPN on physical machine and Whonix-Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/vpn-on-physical-machine-and-whonix-gateway/303</link>
    <description>Hi all,
i&#39;ve 2 questions concerning Whonix Gateway, VPN and Windows-Workstation.
Sorry in advance for my english as it isn&#39;t my first language.

1) My first doubt is about my internet connection :
my physical machine (on Windows 8) uses a VPN ; then i start my &quot;Virtual System&quot; composed of &quot;Whonix Gateway AND Windows-Workstation&quot;.

If i understand well, my &quot;physical&quot; network works like this :
user (windows 8) -&gt; ISP -&gt; VPN -&gt; INTERNET. (case 1)

Then, if i use my &quot;virtual&quot; network, it should work like that :
user (windows 8) -&gt; ISP -&gt; VPN -&gt; [WHONIX Gway -&gt; TOR -&gt; Windows-Workstation] -&gt; INTERNET (case 2)

In case number 2, if my VPN isn&#39;t sufficiently safer and i lost connection ; [u]does it mean that i will lost Tor connection too[/u] ? 

2) Following the statement above, and after reading this very useful page (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN) ; do you think that, finally, the better choice is to install a VPN on my virtual Windows-Workstation. If VPN connection is lost, all trafic go to Tor via Whonix-Gateway ?

            <p>No idea.</p>
<p>Since you’re using TCP, seems like not an Whonix issue. In theory, there could be VPN providers blocking connections from the Tor network. Consider researching this or asking the support.</p>
<p>Contacting VPN provider support and/or the OpenVPN support channels might help.</p>

            <p>Thanks again Patrick.<br>
Finally i decide to install a VPN on windows-workstation.</p>
<ol>
<li>First i directly installed Mullvad Client but had some connection pb. Connection works (with TCP checked) but then failed after 10-20 seconds.</li>
<li>So i decided to install OpenVpn and download Mullvad configuration files. Same problem. :-\</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my config file :</p>

</aside>
<p>So you want to hide Tor from websites (not from your ISP). Use a proxy, vpn or ssh inside the Workstation then. There are no other options.</p>

Possible when you install the VPN in the Workstation.
<blockquote>- in Whonix Gateway (but i think that my windows-workstation would not accept any connection different of Tor )</blockquote>
Not possible. VPN installed on Whonix-Gateway might hide Tor from your ISP (drawback: you need fail closed mechanism as per documentation). But connection schema would be user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination. Therefore, websites would know you're using Tor.
<blockquote>or
- directly in Windows-workstation : in this case, i would like to avoid to start my VPN each time i open my windows-workstation.</blockquote>
Up to the configuration of the VPN software.
<blockquote>The best thing would be to install/configure VPN once, and then it starts automatically when i use internet. I don't like VPN's client, i prefer to configure OpenVpn with configuration files.</blockquote>
I also prefer just using command line tools and text config files.
<p>Torproject writes about the same scheme :</p>
<blockquote>[u]you -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN/SSH[/u]
<p>You can also route VPN/SSH services through Tor. That hides and secures your Internet activity from Tor exit nodes. Although you are exposed to VPN/SSH exit nodes, you at least get to choose them. If you’re using VPN/SSHs in this way, you’ll want to pay for them anonymously (cash in the mail [beware of your fingerprint and printer fingerprint], Liberty Reserve, well-laundered Bitcoin, etc).</p>
<p>However, you can’t readily do this without using virtual machines. And you’ll need to use TCP mode for the VPNs (to route through Tor). In our experience, establishing VPN connections through Tor is chancy, and requires much tweaking.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Even if you pay for them anonymously, you’re making a bottleneck where all your traffic goes – the VPN/SSH can build a profile of everything you do, and over time that will probably be really dangerous</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The underlined statement is correct. You can’t have it both ways here. You can’t join the anonymity set of other Tor users + hide Tor from websites. You can’t use a VPN + profit from stream isolation (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation</a>). To combine best of both worlds, it would be best to only use the post-Tor proxy/VPN/ssh (user -&gt; Tor -&gt; proxy/VPN/ssh) when really needed and not for all use. Or somehow circle proxy/VPN/ssh, but that’s difficult.</p>

A correctly configured Whonix-(Windows or Default)-Workstation will always go through Tor. Internet connection on the host is irrelevant for this. When the VPN goes down, connection will be interrupted, and Tor will re-connect without VPN (because Whonix-Gateway does not "care" about the host internet connection, it uses what is provided).

<blockquote>do you think that, finally, the better choice is to install a VPN on my virtual Windows-Workstation.</blockquote>
Can't answer with yes/no. Depends on what you want to do. It changes the connection schema.
VPN on the host: user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination
VPN in Whonix-Workstation: user Tor -&gt; VPN -&gt; destination
<blockquote>If VPN connection is lost, all trafic go to Tor via Whonix-Gateway ?</blockquote>
Yes.

            <p>Hi all,<br>
i’ve 2 questions concerning Whonix Gateway, VPN and Windows-Workstation.<br>
Sorry in advance for my english as it isn’t my first language.</p>
<ol>
<li>My first doubt is about my internet connection :<br>
my physical machine (on Windows 8) uses a VPN ; then i start my “Virtual System” composed of “Whonix Gateway AND Windows-Workstation”.</li>
</ol>
<p>If i understand well, my “physical” network works like this :<br>
user (windows 8) -&gt; ISP -&gt; VPN -&gt; INTERNET. (case 1)</p>
<p>Then, if i use my “virtual” network, it should work like that :<br>
user (windows 8) -&gt; ISP -&gt; VPN -&gt; [WHONIX Gway -&gt; TOR -&gt; Windows-Workstation] -&gt; INTERNET (case 2)</p>
<p>In case number 2, if my VPN isn’t sufficiently safer and i lost connection ; <span class="bbcode-u">does it mean that i will lost Tor connection too</span> ?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Following the statement above, and after reading this very useful page (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN" rel="nofollow noopener">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN</a>) ; do you think that, finally, the better choice is to install a VPN on my virtual Windows-Workstation. If VPN connection is lost, all trafic go to Tor via Whonix-Gateway ?</li>
</ol>
<p>Regards,</p>
