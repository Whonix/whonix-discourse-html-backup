    <title>disable pulseadio in the workstation in addition to the gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-pulseadio-in-the-workstation-in-addition-to-the-gateway/8544</link>
    <description>I noticed that pulseaudio was removed from the gateway. Has there been a fix found for pulseaudio/apparmor, perhaps something in &quot;apparmor-profile-everything&quot;? For those of use who don&#39;t really play video and audio files, is there a way to disable/remove pulseaudio from the workstation? Thanks</description>

<p>Assuming you mean pulseaudio being used for sandbox escapes or other vulnerabilities, no.

<p>Run</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge non-qubes-vm-audio alsa-utils pulseaudio pavucontrol
</code></pre>
<p>and disable audio in the VM settings.</p>
<p>For Virtualbox go to Settings -&gt; Audio -&gt; Enable Audio and un-tick it.</p>
<p>For virt-manager, go to the “i” symbol -&gt; Sound device -&gt; Remove.</p>
