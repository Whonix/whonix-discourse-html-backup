    <title>No Route To Host, General Socks Failure when connecting to bridges</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/no-route-to-host-general-socks-failure-when-connecting-to-bridges/6588</link>
    <description>I have setup torrc to connect to bridges before connecting to tor, however, when I run &quot;arm&quot;, I can see that the error when connecting to the bridges is &quot;General Socks Failure&quot;. When I try to telnet to the bridge on the specified port, I get, &quot;no route to host&quot;. The interesting thing here is that when I remove the bridges, and connect to tor directly, tor is able to connect...

Any ideas whats going on here?</description>

            <p>Thank you for your reply…</p>
<p>I am not using any VPNs or proxies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since there is no connection to Tor this requires disabling stream isolation and running command under user  <code>clearnet</code> . But this might not be a benefit here since Tor is able to connect without bridges. Just a reminder user clearnet runs over clearnet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have verified the bridges are in fact valid, and capable of being connected to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u debian-tor tor --verify-config</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran the command, and it said Configuration was valid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you have  <code>seccomp</code>  configured. Meaning do you have  <code>Sandbox 1</code>  configured in your torrc? If so please remove that configm as  <code>seccomp</code>  and bridges are not compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not have this setting, and I checked all of the torrc and tor conf files on the machine</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Bridges#Connection_Issues" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Bridges#Connection_Issues</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have reviewed the issues on this page, and none apply to my situation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try using a (private) (obfuscated) bridge that uses port  <em>80</em>  or  <em>443</em>  , as these ports are mostly used for web browsing and therefore usually unblocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> but acknowledged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may also want to try new bridges even if you are already using port 80, 443 bridges. If the new bridges don’t work try connecting at a later time since Tor network congestion could also be causing this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to connect via clearnet, so I dont think this is the problem…</p>
<p>The error in arm is “general SOCKS server failure”, sorta vague, so im not sure what the issue is</p>
<p>Does the whonix-gateway work out of the box with tor bridges?</p>

<p>Edit: (Do this first) <s>Lastly</s>, try to simplify your setup. Remove everything that is not necessary. For example, any VPNs proxies etc. Then try bridges.</p>
