    <title>Kvm issue worksation drops to login screen</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kvm-issue-worksation-drops-to-login-screen/2503</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been using KVM for a few days now and I&#39;ve come across a really annoying problem, every so often mainly when I load Tor and connect to any onion website, my screen goes blank and goes to the generic kde login screen.

Lets say I use the default whonix login details user and changeme, it then logs me back into the workstation but everything I was working on or if I had the Tor browser open is now gone/closed.

Does anyone know why this is, I never got this issue in virtualbox.

I attached a photo of the screen I copied it from google images but this is the screen that pops up and I have to put in user/changeme.
