    <title>Slow scroll on a pointpad with two fingers</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/slow-scroll-on-a-pointpad-with-two-fingers/8189</link>
    <description>Scrolling with two fingers on the touchpad has become less sensitive than it was on the host, there were no problems on Whonix 14 ... Is this because of the kloak tool? There is no touchpad in the mouse settings ...
For scrolling, you have to put a lot of pressure on the touchpad
Thanks for help.</description>
