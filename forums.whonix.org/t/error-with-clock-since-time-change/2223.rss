    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/error-with-clock-since-time-change/2223</link>
    <description>Well, I know im probably going to be told that it something that I must have done in order for this issue to start.... But I can 100% assure that I have not changed any settings in quiet some time...

Since time changed last night my clocks in both gateway and workstation are off only now by 4 hours rather than the usual 5. More than the normal UTC -5 or whatever. Shoudln&#39;t time still display a 5 hour difference?

Also, now in gate way when I try to do the normal Sudo apt-get update etc... I get this &quot;cannot initiate the connection to mirroe.whonix.de:80&quot; etc

None of this was happening until time changed last night...

anyone know whats going on here?</description>

<p>I try not to post <strong>random</strong> links from the internet. If you had glanced at the article, you would’ve seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daylight saving time</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time). For example, local time on the east coast of the United States is five hours behind UTC during winter, but four hours behind while daylight saving is observed there.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>A few things:  First of all: Don’t change ANYTHING related to time. You are creating multiple problems by that, which are hard to resolve. Second: UTC doesn’t have day light saving. Just know read that that was your issue. The clock should thus not change.</p>

<p>Coordinated Universal Time (abbreviated to UTC) is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar time at 0° longitude; it does not observe daylight saving time. For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.

<p>Since time changed last night my clocks in both gateway and workstation are off only now by 4 hours rather than the usual 5. More than the normal UTC -5 or whatever. Shoudln’t time still display a 5 hour difference?</p>
<p>Also, now in gate way when I try to do the normal Sudo apt-get update etc… I get this “cannot initiate the connection to <a href="http://mirroe.whonix.de:80" rel="nofollow noopener">mirroe.whonix.de:80</a>” etc</p>
<p>None of this was happening until time changed last night…</p>
<p>anyone know whats going on here?</p>
