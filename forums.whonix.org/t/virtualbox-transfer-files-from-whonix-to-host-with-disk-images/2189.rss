    <title>[Virtualbox] Transfer files from whonix to host with disk images</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/virtualbox-transfer-files-from-whonix-to-host-with-disk-images/2189</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m a new user to Whonix and used Tails before (in a VM). Since it seems that getting files from the VM to the host is a difficult topic ( https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer ) I want to present you an easy way how I did it on Tails and how it works on Whonix.
As for security reasons I didn&#39;t want to have virtualbox guest additions installed (I uninstalled them with sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-guest-* ).

Basically we use a new hard disk that we mount in whonix, whose container we can also mount on the guest OS.
Problems with this solution: You (might) have to shutdown the Whonix Workstation to read the container.


**_Creating the Container_**
1) Shutdown the Workstation, go in the settings of it and add a new hard disk to the first (SAS) controller (if you add it to the second, it will not boot). Choose a fixed size vmdk Container.

2) Start the workstation and do the following:

To create a FAT device, we have to install the fat drivers:
    `sudo apt-get install dosfstools`

To have a partition and mount manager (this is superior to the KDE one since we can one-click mount volumes):
`sudo apt-get install gnome-disk-utility`

Start &quot;disks&quot; via GUI (if you start it via console it will not work):
`Applications - Utility - Disks`

3) Select device and format it with FAT32 (cogwheel symbol). You could use NTFS I guess (that would allow files &gt;4GB), but I never needed that and never tested it.

4) Mount it with the &quot;play&quot; button.


----------
**_Mounting the virtual disk on the host OS_**
_On Windows_ you can use ImDisk ( http://www.ltr-data.se/opencode.html/ ):
Shutdown the Workstation and then you can right-click the vmdk main file and select &quot;Mount as ImDisk Virtual Disk&quot;.
If the VM is still running it will give an error. There is a way to still mount them by using VMWare Workstation and mount it via &quot;File - Map Virtual Disks&quot; (As far as I know the free VMWare Player does not offer this feature). There are also other ways to mount vmdk files but I didn&#39;t test them if they work if the workstation VM is still running.

On Linux, google for &quot;linux mount vmdk&quot; - there are lots of ways.

Feel free to add this to your wiki.

greetings and thank you for creating Whonix!</description>

<p>Actually, mounting vmdk on linux with Libre Software is <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Virtualization_Platform#VirtualBox">not simple</a>. Because <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer#VMDK">virtualbox-fuse</a> is no longer available in jessie and QEMU based ways require QEMU version equal or bigger than 2.8.</p>
<p>Anyhow. I added a stub here:<br>

            <p>Interesting!</p>
<p>This is like</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer#Transfer_files_from_one_Whonix-Workstation_to_a_different_Whonix-Workstation_through_a_VDI_file">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer#Transfer_files_from_one_Whonix-Workstation_to_a_different_Whonix-Workstation_through_a_VDI_file</a></p>
<p>but for Windows rather than Linux?</p>
<p>What about installing an ext4 file system driver instead? That way one might be able to skip creating a second partition. Then you might theoretically be able to just access the vmdk / ext4 disk from a Windows host.</p>
