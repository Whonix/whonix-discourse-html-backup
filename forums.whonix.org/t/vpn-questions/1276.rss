    <description>current vm topology:

whonix, appvms -&gt; proxyvm: firewall -&gt; proxyvm: vpn -&gt; netvm -&gt; internet

1. I installed vpn in its own proxyvm so as not to break netvm. I&#39;m not sure that this is the best place for it. Watching netvm traffic with iftop and some connections are still being made (probably dom0, template updates). Will install vpn-firewall on vpn proxy vm and see if connections drop. Otherwise, may need to move vpn to netvm.

2. Would like to install your vpn-firewall to proxy vm. Just became slightly familiar with debian and now back to 0 knowledge with fedora. Do any modifications need to be made to /usr/bin/vpnfirewall? Plan is to place script in /rw/... and modify /rw/config/rc.local to run vpnfirewall. Any other advice?
edit:
Looks like vpn-firewall needs to be on netvm regardless of where vpn is installed since everything needs to be routed to 10.137.1.1 (netvm). I don&#39;t want to mess up any iptables in netvm though. Is there some way to change vpn-firewall so that it allows traffic to vpn.ip.00.00 via 10.137.1.1 ONLY?

3. With vpn-firewall in place, proxyvm: firewall probably becomes redundant? I have no idea so I&#39;ll leave it in place to be safe. Don&#39;t understand yet how the update proxies work.

#1 probably belongs upstream to Qubes mailing list but have come to trust and value your advice. Thanks.</description>

            <p>Seems like 2 ways to implement vpn-firewall:</p>
<p>A:</p>
<ol>
<li>cp ./usr/bin/vpnfirewall /rw/config</li>
<li>chmod +x /rw/config/vpnfirewall</li>
<li>append to /rw/config/rc.local : /rw/config/vpnfirewall</li>
<li>start openvpn</li>
</ol>
<p>B:</p>
<ol>
<li>cp ./etc/init.d/vpnfirewall /rw/config/init.d</li>
<li>edit paths in /rw/config/init.d/vpnfirewall</li>
<li>append to /rw/config/rc.local : chkconfig /rw/config/init.d/vpnfirewall start</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this correct? Which is preferable?</p>
