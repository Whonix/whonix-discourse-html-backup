    <title>No sound in guest [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/no-sound-in-guest-solved/3046</link>
    <description>My sound works 100% on my host. I have turned the volume all the way up on the guest, but there is still no audio. I&#39;ve tried both youtube videos and local media in VLC. I&#39;ve tried switching to ac97 with no luck.

EDIT: I followed the advice of HulaHoop and installed KDE instead of XFCE. The sound now works. Thanks! :blush:

EDIT again: I have found that sound also works in XFCE, but only if you install XFCE + Debian Desktop Environment in the installer. If you install initially without any GUI, and then manually install the xfce4 package afterwards, sound in KVM doesn&#39;t work for some reason, even after installing all the sound related packages.</description>

            <p>Can you check if there is a volume slider for “virt-manager” in the volume taskbar panel on the host? Make sure it exists and is not muted.</p>
<p>My next suggestion is to install another DE like KDE and see if sound works.</p>

            <p>I have tried downloading a clean whonix workstation and only using the stable repo. Still have no sound. The error message in VLC is the same: Connection refused.</p>

            <p>My host is Debian Stable with xfce, guest is standard Whonix Workstation with KDE and testing repo. I have tried disabling AppArmor and the sound still doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Where are these settings? I can’t find them.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found the settings in VLC. It’s set to default. And the no sound problem is not just in VLC, it’s the whole system.</p>
<p>When I launch a media file in VLC through the terminal I get the following message:</p>
<p>pulse audio output error: PulseAudio server connection failure: Connection refused</p>

            <p>What host and DE are you running?</p>
<p>Are sure the same happens without Apparmor profiles installed (in the guest)? Please check this first as they can block access to the sound device.</p>
<p>Don’t switch to ac97. Its a very old device that could have security problems.</p>
