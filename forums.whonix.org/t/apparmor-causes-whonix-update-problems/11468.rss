    <title>AppArmor causes Whonix-Update-Problems</title>

    <description>Hello there
I´m not sure whether this is the right category for the problem I´ve found.
I&#39;m a Qubes-OS user with whonix and I noticed a problem with whonix-workstation-15 that I want to report.

A few days ago I installed AppArmor on both whonix-gw-15 and whonix-ws-15 and set a number of profiles to Enforce mode.

Yesterday I was shown a new update in the torbrowser that I wanted to install over whonix-ws-15.

Thereby the known error message with apt-get-code 125 appeared, which was already reported here in the forum. 

I had tried to fix the error following this tip, which didn&#39;t succeed despite several attempts (I think the code is no longer compatible with the current Whonix version and would have to be adapted).

I got the idea that this might be related to the installation or some enabled profiles of AppArmor. I then put all profiles into complain mode in whonix-ws-15:

sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*.

Then I restarted whonix-ws-15 and the error was fixed. The system check was ok and the Tor browser update worked.

Then I put the profiles back into enforce mode and also restarted whonix-ws-15:

sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*.

The error was there again.

So there must be one or more profiles in AppArmor responsible for blocking the update function in whonix-ws-15.

I will try to find out which ones in the near future and report then. Or does anybody have an idea? Thanks for opinions.</description>
