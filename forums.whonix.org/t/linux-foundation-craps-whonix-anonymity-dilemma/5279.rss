    <title>Linux Foundation Craps , Whonix Anonymity Dilemma</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/linux-foundation-craps-whonix-anonymity-dilemma/5279</link>
    <description>As we all know that Linux Foundation dont mind having nonfree software into linux code which is called &quot;binary blobs&quot;. 

what does that mean is, any distro which is using normal linux kernel it will always contain a nonfree software. and what does that also mean: 

- Security bugs inside these nonfree codes (mostly firmwares) wont be discoverable (Zero day could take forever).
- Any intentional malicious action from these nonfree software is also hidden with no one knowledge. 
- It can be used as backdoors. 

Thats why we have ppl who came to rescue this situation by developing [GNU Linux-Libre](https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/index.en.html). 

Linux Foundation is a total bullshit organization in the way they contribute to the society and freedom of software. one of their laughable things [they accepted Microsoft company](https://news.microsoft.com/2016/11/16/microsoft-contributes-to-open-ecosystem-by-joining-linux-foundation-and-welcoming-google-to-the-net-community/) (the developers of windows malware) into their company ?! 

* if you have no idea why windows is bad , please read small sample here &quot;[Upgrade from Windows](https://www.fsf.org/windows)&quot;

Good news we have that Debian share the same thing by default with libre linux and they dont add any nonfree software into their distro by default unless the user going to add &quot;non-free&quot; packages into the distro repository. 

Whonix Problem:

- [adding non-free packages by default is it safe?](http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/adding-non-free-packages-by-default-is-it-safe/3300)

- Whonix as well doesnt use libre linux. 

so this is by default we are selling non-sense regarding security and anonymity regardless what [advantages](https://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default/700) could some gain from installing it by default. as we might installing backdoors into every whonix user who installed it without anyone knowledge and no body should trust any company (and oracle not very well user security interest) or any nonfree closed source product. 

solution: 

Remove all nonfree software/repo which is installed inside whonix as we dont need any support for any nonfree drivers (since whonix is installed inside virtualized platform, so this is done by host distro if the user want to install for e,g nonfree driver for his wireless or so..). 

Note: vbox Guest should be left to the user needs , we CANT give pre-shipped threat to justify user satisfaction while using full-screen,sharing clipboard ...etc. If the user wants these features then he either:

- install the gues additions by himself 
- complain to Oracle to make it free software in order to be installed by default from us. 
- user contribute or pay and rise a developer to reverse engineering the Guest Addition and make it compatible with current vbox features/version. 

for whonix organization and for taking care of their users we should stop doing it and we shouldnt doing it in the future. 

Also this add an advantage to [whonix-i2p](http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/i2p-integration/4981/1) , since its only for Qubes then we can remove these issues very easily. 


Conclusion:- 

- Whonix is NOT secure distro unless its only contains libre/free software. 

This should be added to the [comparison with others](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others) table as: 

contains nonfree software or purely free software</description>

<p>That’s the problem here. You’re using theoretical research, logic, deductions, arguments. So this sounds big.</p>
<p>But for practical considerations: In case of the VirtualBox non-freeness the complaint is about a single relatively small file that probably hasn’t been changed in years (just the virtual BIOS).</p>

<p>By that strictness, we would have to deprecate Whonix VirtualBox<br>

<p>Then Whonix should also become a GNU project, which is so strict and so<br>

<p>Has anything changed that would convince Whonix developers to reconsider?</p>

<p>My point is just having non-free packages in itself  does not make Whonix a non-secure distribution.</p>

<p>I would agree libre/free is safer and Whonix should use open-source if practical. Although just because its non-free doesn’t mean its back-doored.</p>
<p>There are reasons why VirtualBox has non-free. All of them legitimate. I don’t see that changing unless a reasonable alternative is found.</p>

<p>we change what is under our power and our responsible development. we must not install backdoors (nonfree software) by default due to whatever feature. because that go against what whonix concept of what is offering to the user which is anonymity. and that wont happen unless we have reasonable security, and reasonable security you wont have it unless your source code released and viewed by others or based totally on free software.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As we all know that Linux Foundation dont mind having nonfree software into linux code which is called “binary blobs”.</p>
<p>what does that mean is, any distro which is using normal linux kernel it will always contain a nonfree software. and what does that also mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security bugs inside these nonfree codes (mostly firmwares) wont be discoverable (Zero day could take forever).</li>
<li>Any intentional malicious action from these nonfree software is also hidden with no one knowledge.</li>
<li>It can be used as backdoors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats why we have ppl who came to rescue this situation by developing <a href="https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/index.en.html" rel="nofollow noopener">GNU Linux-Libre</a>.</p>
<p>Linux Foundation is a total bullshit organization in the way they contribute to the society and freedom of software. one of their laughable things <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2016/11/16/microsoft-contributes-to-open-ecosystem-by-joining-linux-foundation-and-welcoming-google-to-the-net-community/" rel="nofollow noopener">they accepted Microsoft company</a> (the developers of windows malware) into their company ?!</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have no idea why windows is bad , please read small sample here “<a href="https://www.fsf.org/windows" rel="nofollow noopener">Upgrade from Windows</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p>Good news we have that Debian share the same thing by default with libre linux and they dont add any nonfree software into their distro by default unless the user going to add “non-free” packages into the distro repository.</p>
<p>Whonix Problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/adding-non-free-packages-by-default-is-it-safe/3300" rel="nofollow noopener">adding non-free packages by default is it safe?</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whonix as well doesnt use libre linux.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so this is by default we are selling non-sense regarding security and anonymity regardless what <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-virtualbox-guest-addition-by-default/700">advantages</a> could some gain from installing it by default. as we might installing backdoors into every whonix user who installed it without anyone knowledge and no body should trust any company (and oracle not very well user security interest) or any nonfree closed source product.</p>
<p>solution:</p>
<p>Remove all nonfree software/repo which is installed inside whonix as we dont need any support for any nonfree drivers (since whonix is installed inside virtualized platform, so this is done by host distro if the user want to install for e,g nonfree driver for his wireless or so…).</p>
<p>Note: vbox Guest should be left to the user needs , we CANT give pre-shipped threat to justify user satisfaction while using full-screen,sharing clipboard …etc. If the user wants these features then he either:</p>
<ul>
<li>install the gues additions by himself</li>
<li>complain to Oracle to make it free software in order to be installed by default from us.</li>
<li>user contribute or pay and rise a developer to reverse engineering the Guest Addition and make it compatible with current vbox features/version.</li>
</ul>
<p>for whonix organization and for taking care of their users we should stop doing it and we shouldnt doing it in the future.</p>
<p>Also this add an advantage to <a href="http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/i2p-integration/4981/1" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix-i2p</a> , since its only for Qubes then we can remove these issues very easily.</p>
<p>Conclusion:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix is NOT secure distro unless its only contains libre/free software.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be added to the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others" rel="nofollow noopener">comparison with others</a> table as:</p>
<p>contains nonfree software or purely free software</p>
