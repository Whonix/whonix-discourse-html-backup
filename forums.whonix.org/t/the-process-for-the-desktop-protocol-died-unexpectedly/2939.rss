    <title>&quot;The process for the desktop protocol died unexpectedly&quot;</title>

    <description>Hello,

I have installed a portable version of VirtualBox on my flash and I am able to run both Whonix gateway &amp; the workstation.

However as soon as I try open any application it crashes and tells me

&quot;The process for the desktop protocol died unexpectedly&quot;

I found a similar question on VirtualBox website but no one had an answer for them.

It is quite frustrating

Thanks

<p>On the host or within the VM?</p>
<p>On the host -&gt; not a Whonix question. That would be independent of Whonix and a general VirtualBox / Windows question as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a>.</p>
