    <description>Okay, I will try and be as thorough as possible. I&#39;m currently running a Xubuntu host OS. Upon uploading Whonix Gateway and Workstation to Oracle VirtualBox I boot into both of them no problem. I begin the Whonixcheck and it says there is updates and upgrades for Debian, so I do &quot;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; on both Gateway and Workstation. However once I&#39;m done with the updates/upgrades I close out of Whonix and when I reopen it again the Workstation loads properly but the Gateway has a problem. The Gateway fails booting after it reaches &quot;Begin: Running /scripts/local-block...done&quot; it keeps repeating this line. Then it drops to initramfs. This ONLY seems to happen after the updating though. And it happens every time, I&#39;ve reinstalled numerous times.</description>

Important, one has to apt-get autoremove so swap-file-creator gets removed.

Please check if really removed.

After removal of swap-file-creator, I’ve run

            <p>Which version of Whonix?<br>
It sounds like a similar issue as described here <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-virtualbox-14-0-0-5-5-testers-wanted/4642/17?u=algernon">Whonix VirtualBox 14.0.0.5.5 Testers Wanted!</a><br>
though not 100% the same. In my case the boot was just delayed and it didn’t drop to an initramfs shell.<br>
You could try the following: On the gateway after the updates have been installed but before rebooting do:<br>
<code>echo "RESUME=none" &gt; /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume</code><br>
then do:<br>
<code>update-initramfs -u -k all</code><br>
Reboot.<br>
Also during the upgrade look for anything odd and/or initramfs related.</p>
