    <title>multiple ver of Torbrowser unstable?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-ver-of-torbrowser-unstable/4488</link>
    <description>in the past 2 weeks I have noticed that tb in whonix seems to be less stable. I now regularly get crashed tabs on pretty much every site I try to visit. 
So far I have tried to rm -r the ~/.tb dir and reinstall different versions of the browser but I still seem to be having the same problem.
#1 Is anyone else having issues?
#2 I assume there is a log being generated somewhere, can someone let know where so I can post it and perahsp get some more insite?
thx</description>

            <p>Thx.<br>
Ironically I removed tbb again, downloaded it again, and started it up. and it has stayed stable, didnâ€™t even have to do anything? But if it comes back I will try their suggestion!</p>

            <p>Hi <code>jbwihokkc</code></p>
<p>I know of at least one similar issue that is being tracked on TBB bugs. The user is experiencing crashes that affects multiple versions of TorBrowser.  It is <em>possible</em> that the issue you are having is related.</p>
<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24040">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24040</a></p>
<p>To view your log files:</p>
<p><code>cat /var/log/tor/log</code></p>
<p>To continually view new logs:</p>
<p><code>tail -f /var/log/tor/log</code></p>
