    <description>So i made a fresh new instalation of whonix, but when I run panopticlick it says:

Within our dataset of several hundred thousand visitors tested in the past 45 days, only **one in 80101.0 browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.**

Currently, we estimate that your browser has a fingerprint that conveys **16.29 bits of identifying information.**

I go to https://amiunique.org/fp and it says:
# **Yes! (You can be tracked!)**

41.77 % of observed browsers are **Firefox** , as yours.

4.76 % of observed browsers are **Firefox 60.0** , as yours.

55.96 % of observed browsers run **Windows** , as yours.

25.47 % of observed browsers run **Windows 7** , as yours.

63.85 % of observed browsers have set **&quot;en&quot;** as their primary language, as yours.

9.45 % of observed browsers have **UTC0** as their timezone, as yours.

However, your full fingerprint is unique among the 1045680 collected so far.


Why is that i havent install anything. Can you give me an advice.</description>
