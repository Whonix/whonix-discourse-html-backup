    <title>Difference between whonix gateway and workstation? What is needed for kali</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/difference-between-whonix-gateway-and-workstation-what-is-needed-for-kali/15971</link>
    <description>So was trying to set up Kali to run through whonix on virtualbox.  I downloaded whonix XFCE linux for VBOX and imported it into virtualbox.  Once that is done can i get rid of the workstation since i would just be using Kali for that or do i still need that?  All I need is gateway right.  If anyone can point me to up to date instructions on running Kali through virtualbox I would appreciate it.  Thank you.</description>

Like many tools, Tor / Whonix itself is a dual use tool. Due to Tor usage statistics (<a href="http://planete.inrialpes.fr/papers/TorTraffic-NSS10.pdf">http://planete.inrialpes.fr/papers/TorTraffic-NSS10.pdf</a>) and low rates of abuse, I believe that on average, Tor does more good than harm. 
Are there any statistics on pentesting tools, on their good/harm ratio? 
I am not sure the combination of anonymity and pentesting is a useful one. Which legitimate use cases come to your mind? 
At the moment I believe making anonymous pentestiâ€¦
