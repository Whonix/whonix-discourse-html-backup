        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>That’s where it’s getting really dubious from Joanna to fingerpoint ORWL specifically when all the other laptops approved have major security opening well known and documented such as ME attacks using USB. Design SHIFT paid Joanna to help architect ORWL and optimize the system to support Qubes out of the box and the architecture, firmware, schematics and source code were provided to Invisible lab. The Intel CPU version was recommended by Joanna and she has the first prototype of ORWL. These below are the minutes of the architecture selection.</p>
<p>Ok, so we have spent almost 7 hours in a restaurant yesterday discussing this…</p>
<p>As mentioned, nobody likes the Option <span class="hashtag">#1</span>.</p>
<p>Option <span class="hashtag">#3</span> turned out to be a no-go, because at the time of the main CPU wakes up<br>
from S3 we don’t have access to Qubes VMs, where we could delegate NFC<br>
processing to occur. And we can’t have this access till we authenticate the<br>
user. It’s a classic chicken-and-egg problem here.</p>
<p>Option <span class="hashtag">#4</span> alone (i.e. without <span class="hashtag">#3</span>) is, of course, not good enough because we want<br>
ORWL unlocking to also work with a default (cheap) token, whatever it would be.</p>
<p>So, the option <span class="hashtag">#2</span> is what’s left. After some discussions it seems like we should<br>
be able to utilize MPU on the Maxim to get the satisfactory security isolation<br>
in a similar way as we wanted from the MMU unit (i.e to isolate secure-boot and<br>
flash handling-related code from the auth/unlocking related, and from the dirty<br>
NFC stacks and drivers). Additionally it seems like this would not necessarily<br>
mean writing a new microkernel by us or Genode (something which would likely be<br>
prohibitively expensive), because Rafal just found this promisingly-looking<br>
project:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-MPU-memory-protection-unit.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-MPU-memory-protection-unit.html</a></p>
<p>…which looks like it might be very useful for our case. I wonder if any of<br>
you: Marc, or Gupta, or your team, has any experience with this FreeROTS?</p>
<p>So, that looks promising!</p>
<p>As for the details regarding the actual NFC token, and if it should also play<br>
the role of a smart card (so carry user secret(s) with it – I think these are<br>
quite secondary topics that could be left to be determined later. However, if<br>
you already had some specific NFC tokens/smart cards at your considerations,<br>
please send over their datasheets our way (or better: push them to the<br>
owl-resources repo).</p>
<p>Some other things we discussed included a method for the end user to verify the<br>
device he or she got has not been tampered during the shipment. This uses a<br>
secret in the uC and the trusted OLED. So, this would work well with this Maxim<br>
uC. This method does not, however, solve the problem of the user needing to<br>
trust the factory. This topic is more complex to solve and requires more<br>
thinking. As a temporary solution we could say: those who don’t trust the<br>
factory can just build the device themselves (as it’s gonna be Open Hardware<br>
project), but this option doesn’t sound quite satisfactory in practice.</p>
<p>Looking to your feedback. If everything looks ok, I will update the arch docs<br>
early next week.</p>
<p>joanna.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>archi2000</code></p>
<p>If you read through the blog post you will see that Joanna was expressing her frustration with vendors not pursuing trustworthy personal computers which would in fact be a major step forward.</p>

<p>I think the point of her blog was - you can add all security mechanisms you want but it will not be a trustful computer unless (at a minimum ):</p>
<pre><code>1. The data sheet for secure uC must be made public.

2. All the firmware sources must be made public.

3. Firmware process would have to be reproducible.

4. Tool chain for firmware builds need to be made public

5. The uC should expose a reliable way to dump whole firmware through some HW mechanism.
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>The main point of her blog was ORWL is not a trustful computer. However you have not shown anything to the contrary.  I think there is a reason for that.  No one could prove that unless (at a minimum ) points 1 - 5 <em>above</em> was met.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>a few HW items to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ME engine. ORWL is only computer to disconnect USB and HDMI ports until user is 2 factor authenticated and user is present (less than 10m from device). This is managed by secure controller before Intel is booted. So there is no ME engine attacks possible unless user is present and insert something rogue onto the ports…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All keys (users ID, SSD encryption keys…) are stored in secure controller. This prevent many attacks such as die opening, TPM recent fiasco and low level attacks on boot or Bios. (SGX for instance is not protected) Keys are released only when user are authenticated. See here for die attacks : <a href="http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Tarnovsky/Presentation/bh-dc-08-tarnovsky.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-08/Tarnovsky/Presentation/bh-dc-08-tarnovsky.pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temperature attacks and 32k fault injection is also prevented by secure controller. recent example includes Trezor.  <a href="https://medium.com/@Zero404Cool/frozen-trezor-data-remanence-attacks-de4d70c9ee8c" rel="nofollow noopener">https://medium.com/@Zero404Cool/frozen-trezor-data-remanence-attacks-de4d70c9ee8c</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System is protected under active mesh even when power is disconnected. This prevent memory fault injection, PCB modifications, interfaces snooping and other SPI, I2C, USB… attacks. This link show attack performed on ARM CPU but similar attacks are done on Intel. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/147.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/147.pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>secure controller and keyfob on ORWL have active die shield. see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sylvain_Guilley/publication/271472284_Cryptographically_secure_shields/links/550f497f0cf2752610a00cc9/Cryptographically-secure-shields.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sylvain_Guilley/publication/271472284_Cryptographically_secure_shields/links/550f497f0cf2752610a00cc9/Cryptographically-secure-shields.pdf</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>side channel is not protected on most system. ORWL Secure controller is preventing this. These attacks can be performed over the air as presented in this video or using SDA / DPA analysis if attacker can monitor power supply line. So any VPN, login key or encryption keys are exposed on PC without this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L8rnYhnLt8" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L8rnYhnLt8</a> and power analysis on Wikipedia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In term of logistic, ORWL ship with separate hash keys by PIN mailer. If really concerned, schematics and code is available and you can reprogram the device (fairly intensive work but possible).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>enjoy the reading…</p>

            <p>This blog post is a pile of rubbish. She does not know much on HW and most of the comments are not fair/irrelevant. There is nothing equivalent to this device. She was involved at the beginning of the project…</p>
