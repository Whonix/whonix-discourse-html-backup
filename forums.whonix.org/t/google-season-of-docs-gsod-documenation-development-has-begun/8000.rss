    <description>Hi everyone!

I&#39;m @0brand

Today marks the start of the [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) writing phase where I  will begin working on my project proposal with guidance from my mentor. @Patrick (Lead Whonix developer) will be my mentor for GSoD. The project chosen for this first ever Season of Docs is developing the core documentation for [Kicksecure OS](https://whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure) with a focus on teaching beginners about Linux, and best practice that will lay the foundation for future learning. Anyone that would like to contribute and / or follow along with the GSoD Kicksecure project can follow this thread which will detail the work completed on an daily basis.
