    <description>To escape exit nodes bans use VPNs from vpngate.net
If connection to a VPN fails, change Identity (exit node) for your transproxy stream.
If you try to connect to a VPN and you get &quot;reconnect in 5 seconds&quot; it means your transproxy stream exit node is OK and you have to try another VPN. If you get nothing during connection attempt, you need to change your transproxy exit node as described above.
Enjoy!</description>

            <p>Depending on the particular information you’re transmitting, I would be very careful while using public VPN, same goes for proxies - just saying! Thanks for sharing the public VPN list though.</p>
