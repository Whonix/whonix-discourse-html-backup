    <description>hi there , as usual i like to play with things (sometimes) , so i opened tor browser and disabled https everwhere &amp; noscript; and started browsing advertisements &amp; news websites , after that i closed tor browser then re-opened it again but it didnt open because it says that tor is already opened and it should be closed , so i went to system settings trying to open the processes monitory to disable/end tor browser process. the surprising thing is that: i have got over 100+ messages saying &quot;do you really want to move this item to trash?&quot; image:- (focus on the number of messages and tor icone)

and there is nothing i can press, except &quot;Trash&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; , i clicked cancels many times but useless because i should complete the whole messages so then i pressed on trash and thats what happened:-

so the question:- how do we know that , which one is the causative of this problem whonix or tor browser ?

according to the un-safe browsing method that i was using it, it looks Tor browser is the problem of that because of maybe a malicious software done?! but how can someone make sure of that? and not saying its might be a system crush? also how can we benefit from this error to know the root causative of it (like any logs or commands i should check/do or something like that)?  

thnx  :)</description>

We don't without failing to reproduce in Debian while being able to reproduce in Whonix.
<blockquote>maybe a malicious software done?!</blockquote>
Unlikely.
<blockquote>but how can someone make sure of that?</blockquote>
Economically impossible.
<blockquote>also how can we benefit from this error to know the root causative of it (like any logs or commands i should check/do or something like that)? </blockquote>
Without instructions to reliably reproduce this and/or without ~ 100 k USD and/or without a technically versed volunteer researching this, I don't think we can.
<p>At the moment I find a physically jammed key on the keyboard or user error more likely.</p>
