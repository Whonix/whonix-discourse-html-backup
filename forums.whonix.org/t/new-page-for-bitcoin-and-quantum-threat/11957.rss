    <description>With the rising quantum computers in the horizon, i think having a new page, about the threat quantum computers pose to Bitcoin, is worthwhile. I haven&#39;t seen a full read, just some bits and pieces on the internet, i think bringing it all together can be very nice. I would like to write about this, with references to academic research and other reliable sources. Covering various things. What do you think?</description>

            <p>Thank you for your offer!</p>
<p>After consideration, due to <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/focus-on-low-effort-maintainability/9067" class="inline-onebox">Focus on low-effort maintainability</a> at this time no review of any substantial PQCrypto documentation contributions will be accepted. This is because no trusted expert reviewer contributors knowledgeable on PQCrypto for crypto currencies is available. Seems like <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/hulahoop">@HulaHoop</a> is unavailable. Therefore Whonix cannot become a primary source for detailed cryptocurrency PQCrypto content.</p>
<p>We can and should however add a short mention that PQCrypto is a problem for Bitcoin / crypto currencies and leave it to the user to do their own research.</p>

  <blockquote>
    This request brings up an interesting point. 
Given there are 100s of cryptocurrencies, Whonix should probably make a point of only officially supporting the top players with specific documentation e.g. Bitcoin and other large players. 
Then, when users continue to come to the forums in the future with a support request for the latest fanboiscoin (#56/542 available at that time), it can be stated that it is not officially supported i.e. the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">Free Support Principle</a> applies.

            <p>A new page wouldn’t be needed if this issue was going to be mentioned. An appendix section on the Bitcoin page could reference quantum threats in general &amp; note the Whonix devs lack of trust in reported ‘solutions’ to date (and point to this forum). That would also address any future queries about this issue in the forums or elsewhere.</p>

            <p>I understand your concerns, the best way to explain would be to invite you to the discord server (most active) (fVrEKDS6bh)or Telegram (QRLedgerOfficial).</p>
<p>QRL was mentioned in a few articles, they will also release enQlave soon, which is a post quantum secure Ethereum smart contract. I’m not saying technically QRL is the only solution, there are more technical solutions, like you mentioned, creating a post quantum secure Bitcoin addresses, which users will have to move their funds to. However, this has cons too.</p>

<p>This is why I believe those things should be put clearly on a page.</p>

<p>I would like to know the requirements or expectations from you, what would qualify? QRL is not just an obscure altcoin. It is a post quantum secure cryptocurrency, they use XMSS, which is NIST approved, it also got double audited by red4sec. I do understand your doubts, however, i was trying to make a point. The topic was that Bitcoin might possibly get cracked in the future and that post quantum secure cryptocurrencies are the solution to that (social) problem. My edit was pretty short but i would like to write a page about Bitcoin and the quantum threat, with references to reliable sources to prove my point.</p>

<p>With the huge flood of altcoins out there with most turning out to be pump and dump scams or just bland clones, you could see why I am skeptical. Choosing a cipher is one thing, but it depends on who and how it is deployed because the implementation is the crux of security. I don’t know who the authors of QRL are or what other projects they worked on. What I do know is that I haven’t seen them as one of the more famous, well known  in the encryption or cryptocurrency spaces.</p>
<p>I am sure the Bitcoin devs do have the Quantum computing threat in mind and will take care of it in time because there are huge stakes.</p>
