    <description>While using the Tor Browser Bundle within the workstation (with Javascript enabled), a file within the workstation tried to open on its own -- a message appeared saying &quot;do you want to open [the file]&quot;? The file was a .xz file downloaded from the main Tor website. Is it normal to get a message like this, or is it a sign that the workstation is compromised?

If the workstation is compromised, is there a way to check whether it is compromised or not? (e.g. by running commands, anti-virus, etc.) 

Also, when the &quot;new identity&quot; button on the Tor Browser in the Workstation was clicked, an odd message appeared -- it said *&quot;Tor Browser cannot safely give you a new identity. It does not have access to the Tor Control Port. Are you running Tor Browser Bundle?&quot;*</description>

<p>Malicious: unlikely. As said earlier, malicious activity cannot be noticed in trivial ways. See:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Malware#Indicators_of_Compromise" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Malware#Indicators_of_Compromise</a></p>
<p>If you don’t believe that, look videos about Trojan horses etc. Malware is also “just another” commercial product or even open source. Therefore their usage, capabilities etc. are described like in advertising material for other products.</p>
<p>At no point the victim of a torjan horse will trivially notice it. There is zero reason for already memory resident malware to mess with fonts or to open links. Malware which allows to remotely control a victim machine is similar to an SSH / VNC session - just that the victim cannot easily know that an SSH / VNC session is running. Similar as for SSH there is no reason to mess with fonts, there is no reason to mess with fonts by malware.</p>
<p>Except. The attacker wants the victim to notice something. Zersetzung</p>

<p>Zersetzung (German for "decomposition") is a psychological warfare technique used by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) to repress political opponents in East Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. Zersetzung served to combat alleged and actual dissidents through covert means, using secret methods of abusive control and psychological manipulation to prevent anti-government activities.
 Zersetzung was informally used in East Germany since the 1950s with General Secretary Walter Ulbricht's use of...</p>

            <p>The mysterious package tried to open on its own again (in the workstation). A message appeared asking if I wanted to open a package, even though I never tried to open a package. The message disappeared before I had a chance to read it. A few minutes later, I got this message:</p>
<p><em>Tor Browser Starter (by Whonix developers)</em></p>
<p><em>ERROR: Tor Browser maybe_use_open_link_confirmation error.</em></p>
<p><em>Failed: /usr/lib/open_link_confirmation [URL to Whonix Live]</em></p>
<p>What does this error message mean? Also, is it suspicious that something keeps trying to open on its own?</p>
<p>Also, another thing I noticed is that when I shut down the workstation and turned it on again, the fonts had changed in some areas. For example, when the “properties” button is clicked on a file, the attributes (“name”, “kind”, “open with”, “location”, etc.) have a different font (compared to earlier today).</p>
<p>I can’t tell whether any of these things are bugs, or malicious activity.</p>

<p>This should be fixed.<br>
Means either Whonix-Gateway is not running?<br>
