**The Jury Is In: Monolithic OS Design Is Flawed**
**Microkernel-based Designs Improve Security**

&gt; We address this by a study of critical Linux CVEs, where we examine whether they would be prevented or mitigated by a microkernel-based design. We find that almost all exploits are at least mitigated to less than critical severity, and 40% completely eliminated by an OS design based on a verified microkernel, such as seL4.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; The Windows kernel, while not growing as quickly, is even bigger, with a recent version said to be 60-65 MSLOC (millions of source lines of code) [Ahmed 2016] compared to **26 MSLOC for Linux**.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; But even if we take the most optimistic estimate of 0.5/kSLOC, we can expect the **Linux kernel to have about 13,000 bugs** and the Windows kernel about 30,000.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; The results are a stark confirmation of the arguments in favor of a small TCB. We find that **96% of critical Linux compromises would no longer be critical with a microkernel-based design, 40% would be completely eliminated by an OS based on a verified microkernel, and 29% even with an unverified microkernel.**</description>

            <p>The word monolithic is mythical at this point. Linux is a hybrid where you can lockdown/disable modules unneeded by the system to run. There is a VM only kernel in Debian which we can install at some point to replace the standard one. There is also a module lockdown tool to disable modules.</p>
<p>Hypervisors are the modern microkernel. The Linux/hypervisor duo has become the most performant and secure evolution of both concepts.</p>
