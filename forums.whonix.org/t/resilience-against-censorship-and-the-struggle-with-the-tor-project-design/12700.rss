    <description>Tying in the [Georgetown U. hebtor Project](http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/tor-exit-bridges-bypassing-tor-exit-blocking/12681)
with what I think should be a Whonix mission to deploy [GNUnet](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/GNUnet) alongside the evolving Tor Project suite as bundled. 

I think everyone should see gnunet.org&#39;s [design principles](https://docs.gnunet.org/handbook/gnunet.html#Design-Principles) and [Reference Manual](https://docs.gnunet.org/handbook/gnunet.html) to gain an appreciation of the alignment of Whonix&#39;s mission with the hopeful future of the internet in GNUNet (an ambitious but competent team and vision).

These seem practical models: one the short-term practical-economical, and the second the long-term utopian-ambitious.

I for one would like to see these directions pursued and deployed in Whonix with certainty if not urgency.</description>

<p>Cant happen until GNUnet get its stuff stable which is not the case now.</p>
<p>I2P is way older than the current GNUnet development and still cant find good way to include it in whonix, So gnunet maybe after 5-10 years might find its way in whonix (unless something special gonna happen but generally not much special things happen).</p>

            <p>hebtor unlikely to be used in the real world and even less likely that users will pay for this when workarounds like VPNs work just as well.</p>
<p>As for GNUnet, I’ve tried it many times over the years and never succeeded to get it to connect with its respective network. Have you given it a try?</p>
