    <description>I&#39;ll post here because my problem is related, but feel free to extract this into a new topic.

Whonix-Workstation 10 won&#39;t start in VirtualBox 5.0.0. I know it&#39;s a new version of Virtual Box, but it&#39;s a stable major release, so I wonder if any work will be done to make sure Whonix 10 runs with this version. Whonix Gateway (albeit the no-GUI version) starts and runs properly. I am running the vanilla VirtualBox from Oracle, not the OSE version.

Attached is the error message I&#39;m getting

This happens right after importing the official Whonix Workstation .ova file and trying to run it.</description>

<p>Sounds like a VB issue fixed in 5.1.8. Recommendation is to upgrade version of VirtualBox. (Disabling audio also appears to have worked for some.)</p>
<p>You can download latest version here along with checksums:<br>
<a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.10/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.10/</a><br>
<strong>!!! However, these downloads are not signed !!!</strong> Checksums guarantee integrity of download - they don’t verify authenticity. I don’t know how OSX package management works. I believe Oracle only offers signed .debs &amp; .rpms.</p>

<p>I reimported the appliance file for the workstation and all seems good; sounds like a tricky bug on VB side.</p>
<p>Conclusion seems to be: not a Whonix issue, as far as I can see…</p>

            <p>Just an update:</p>
<p>Digging a bit more in the host logs, I found that in fact the VirtualBox process spawn at start crash and dump some logs in the Mac Console. I guess this is more a VirtualBox issue.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Sorry for resurecting this topic, but I could not find support elsewhere.</p>
<p>I installed Whonix Workstation and Gateway 13.0.0.1.1 on VirtualBox 5.0.20 hosted on OSX 10.11.6 laptop about 4 days ago.</p>
<p>It worked just fine for 2 days, and then the Workstation started to fail the same way described above by Greenwhonix.</p>
<p>I tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>starting with “Detachable start” works, but the window cannot be brought to life after boot is completed.</li>
<li>I upgraded to VirtualBox 5.1.10 r112026 but no improvement</li>
<li>I bumped up memory from the default 700 something MB to 2GB but no improvement</li>
<li>I bumped up from 1 to 2 processors; no luck</li>
</ol>
<p>I am running out of ideas.</p>
<p>Could someone confirm I am not the only one on the planet facing this issue ? <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>o/ Patrick,</p>
<p>I have tested the Workstation 11 on VBox 5 quite extensively.</p>
<ol>
<li>I cannot replicate the error initially reported on this thread.</li>
<li>From my POV, the title of the thread is 100% false.  A correct thread would be titled;  Whonix Workstation 11 IS KNOWN to work properly on VBox 5.</li>
<li>Any even slightly experienced user of VBox should be smart enough to realize if an error or corruption issue occurs within a running VBox Guest OS, the very first thing you should try is increasing the memory allocation and or the number of CPUs exposed to the VBox Guest.  That advice is certainly not just limited to Whonix Guests.</li>
<li>I refuse to spend even one additional second of my life on the non-issue, ‘issue’ raised by this ridiculous thread.</li>
<li>Even though the Workstation 11 runs perfectly, and (almost everything) works, there are several significant shortcomings which need to be addressed.  I will start a new thread pertinent to that topic.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should consider this case to be closed.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that VirtualBox is being stupid and displays a totally useless, user unfriendly error message, which, as Linux user, I’m not used to and I don’t care to get used, for some reason you link to an ancient forum post from 2010, why? I consider this necroposting useless, considering that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Previous VirtualBox version 4.3.x is MUCH NEWER than 2010</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whonix-Workstation worked fine in that version</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I mean exactly what it means: I run the virtualbox version installed from the virtualbox installer that’s offered by Oracle here <a href="https://virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads" rel="nofollow noopener">https://virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads</a> (see All Distributions at the bottom of the list), not the OSE version that’s usually offered through the repositories of particular Linux distros.</p>
<p>For now I have just reverted to using virtualbox 4.x</p>

            <p>cant view the image . i was using this website before but it has problem with viewing the image.</p>
<p>use this website (i use it in images reports):-</p>
<p><a href="http://freeimagehosting.net/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://freeimagehosting.net/</a></p>
<p>(after uploading any image , take the link of the image not the link of the website)<br>
if u r concerns about anonymity because the servers located in US , well use free image hosting in the darknet (u can find these in hidden services wikis or …etc)</p>
<p>regarding Vbox+whonix:- last day i have downloaded virtualbox in my friend pc with installing whonix 10 in it. but to be honest with u i dont remember which version of the virtualbox was (didnt take the intention to look at the version of the Vbox because i didnt face any problems with versions b4 so my brain cant remember it).but it was like this : windows 8 + vbox + whonix 10 = working good.</p>
<p>but what do u mean vanilla from oracle ?</p>

            <p>I’ll post here because my problem is related, but feel free to extract this into a new topic.</p>
<p>Whonix-Workstation 10 won’t start in VirtualBox 5.0.0. I know it’s a new version of Virtual Box, but it’s a stable major release, so I wonder if any work will be done to make sure Whonix 10 runs with this version. Whonix Gateway (albeit the no-GUI version) starts and runs properly. I am running the vanilla VirtualBox from Oracle, not the OSE version.</p>
<p>Attached is the error message I’m getting</p>
<p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/b26lw192h/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://postimg.org/image/b26lw192h/</a></p>
<p>This happens right after importing the official Whonix Workstation .ova file and trying to run it.</p>
