    <title>Grsecurity in conjunction with AppArmor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/grsecurity-in-conjunction-with-apparmor/404</link>
    <description>One question:  I have been thinking about installing linux-patch-grsecurity2 from Debian repos. However, I am afraid that it might break apparmor work, or even stop the OS from functioning. Does anyone know if that would be the case?
Also, would installing that patch be enough to improve somehow the security, or would it be necessary to go through a hard configuration process??

            <p>This is quite a security specific question that is not very specific to Whonix. As per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a> you may get best answers in some more specialized places, see also <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support</a> for some possible places.</p>
