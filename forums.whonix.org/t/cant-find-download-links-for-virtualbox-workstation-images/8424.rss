            <p>Sorry for having been a bit “rude”.

<p>Yes. If I don’t search for multiple OVAs, you can find what you are searching for…<br>
So keep up the good work on don’t let yourselfs be bothered by some angry guy who had too few hours of sleep. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

This release introduces unified ova downloads. Rather than a separate Whonix-Gateway ova and Whonix-Workstation ova download, from now, there is only a single Whonix ova which includes both Whonix virtual machines (VMs), Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation. 
This will reduce the steps users are required to apply (one download less / only one instead of two downloads), improve usability, make Whonix downloads more standardized compared to other software downloads, and …

<p>Forums: We could tweak some settings. That would require a better description what is wrong with it. However, options are limited. In short: we are users of popular webapps. We don’t have resources to fix issues in these.<br>

<p>Some usability issues in Whonix software are obvious but cannot be fixed due to lack of resources and coordination with third parties, see:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Linux_User_Experience_versus_Commercial_Operating_Systems</a></p>
<p>Otherwise nobody ever offered to volunteer helping with user experience (UX). And employing someone reviewing UX and sketching blueprints for improvement would cost around 3 K / USD month, I guess. Not including implementation of suggested changes.</p>
<p>Some Whonix website issues might be fixable if better described.</p>

            <p>Seems the ovs files are importing both machines at once. Did that change from older versions? I remember for v14 I had to download two separate ovas… So I’ll now import 4 machines and will delete 2 of them directly.</p>
<p>But still. Your webpage design is really messy. You can’t find what you are searching for. That goes for the forum too. I really support what you guys are doing and you’re doing great in terms of security but please get someone on your team with understanding of user-machine-interaction or UI design knowledge. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
