    <title>Tor Browser on Workstation Host (physically isolated)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-browser-on-workstation-host-physically-isolated/91</link>
    <description>hi,

I&#39;m running (actually still preparing) a physically isolated setup and I would like to install Tor Browser on the Workstation Host. Now, to avoid a Tor-over-Tor scenario, I was researching how to start Tor Browser standalone. Tor Project&#39;s documentation is a bit outdated here and I was wondering if I may use https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/whonix_workstation/usr/share/whonix/start-tor-browser as a drop-in replacement for the start-tor-browser script that ships with Tor Browser. Would that be a sufficient approach?

If I understand the script correct, I would start Tor Browser like &quot;./start-tor-browser -standalone&quot;. Is there anything else recommended to setup Tor Browser for that usage scenario? Stream Isolation anyone?

thanks!</description>
