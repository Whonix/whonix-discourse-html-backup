    <title>Bitpay payment protocol</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/bitpay-payment-protocol/5341</link>
    <description>Many sites that claim to provide anonymous payment option now force users that wish to pay by bitcoin to use &quot;BitPay&quot;. In this case one must use Bitpay&#39;s payment protocol and the payment address isn&#39;t available.

My gut feeling says security / privacy / anonymity must suffer when they force one to use their protocol instead of just providing a bitcoin address.

Am I right?

Edit: I just found that:

I don&#39;t need anyone to save me from &quot;delayed transactions&quot;. I can set the miner&#39;s fee I like and if I set it too low and that means a delayed transaction so be it. You know what? maybe I don&#39;t care about a fast transaction at all. And if I made a mistake because I&#39;m stupid then I&#39;m willing to suffer the consequences.</description>
