    <title>Whonix KVM Install - Unraid</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-kvm-install-unraid/14709</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. I am pretty good with Unraid OS however I have found out just now that I am a rookie on importing KVM images for VMs in unraid. Going through the building of Whonix vms in Unraid and am stuck. Does anyone have a good guide on how to spin up whonix using Unraid? Especially the xmls and networks? 

I am also trying to to make sure both the gateway+ws also are on my lab interface in unraid and not my main interface. Essentially I am not sure what to also do with the internal and external xmls and to also make sure they are running through a specific interface other than my main interface. Thanks!</description>
