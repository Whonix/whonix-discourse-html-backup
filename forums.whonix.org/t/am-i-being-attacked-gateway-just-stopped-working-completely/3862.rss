    <title>Am I being attacked? Gateway just stopped working completely</title>

    <description>Like title says. I used Whonix a little while ago and it was working fine. I just came back home, started my computer and now I cannot get gateway to work. It gets stuck on the booting screen and doesn&#39;t proceed any further. 

The thing that confuses me is, it was working completely fine earlier today. I did not make any changes at all and no one has been near my computer. Here is what the screen looks like when it doesn&#39;t move any further:

Can anyone help and explain what is happening?</description>

<p>Software is not perfect. Shit happens sometimes thats why you should have taken a snapshot of your VM in a working state.</p>
<p>If someone attacked you they would be smart enough to not leave traces.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. But that is my question, how do I just out of nowhere have disk corruption? I was using Whonix just fine this morning. I left for a little and came back and had this disk corruption. I did not shut down the computer and there was no power outage, I did not download any new files, I did not open the Whonix Konsole and make any changes.</p>

<p>Disk corruption. Can perhaps be sorted out as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a> or probably easier, start with a new gateway.</p>
