            <p>This was actually a downtime that our datacenter caused. It was outside our control, and as far as I know, unrelated to DDoS. It was just a configuration mistake.</p>

            <p>I’d assume Whonix is a semi-popular DDOS attack target for spooks paid by your tax dollars to frustrate people trying to uphold their inalienable right to privacy. See:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack</a></p>
<p>Note that onion services are not immune either, which is why when <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> is non-responsive, so is kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion usually. See:</p>
<p><a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24298">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24298</a></p>
<p>This seems to happen every few weeks. If it is a server-based issue, I’m sure <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/fortasse">@fortasse</a> would know about it.</p>
