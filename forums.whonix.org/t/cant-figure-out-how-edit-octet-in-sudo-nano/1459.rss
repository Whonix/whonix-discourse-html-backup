    <title>Can&#39;t figure out how edit octet in &quot;sudo nano&quot;</title>

    <description>When the command &quot;sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces&quot; is typed in Konsole in the VM Workstation (in VirtualBox) the following appears:

[QUOTE]##Loopback interface.
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

## When using Virtual Machines (not Physical Isolation),
## - eth0 is an internal, isolated, virtual network
## - provided and only visible inside Virtual Machines
## - solely used to communicate with the Gateway
## - it has no access to the host.

## - Thus, the following IP address can NOT cause conflicts
##   with your LAN network router.
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        ##increment last octet of address
        ##on optional additional workstations.
        address [IP address]
        netmask [IP address]
        gateway [IP address]

        ## out commented.
        ## For what do we require the network and broadcast
        ## instances anyway?
        #network [IP address]
        #broadcast [IP address][/QUOTE]

Is the [address [IP address]] the only one that should be modified? What about the netmask, gateway, network and broadcast IP addresses?

How do I [b]edit[/b] the IP addresses that it gives me, for example changing the last octet? I typed &quot;^G&quot; to &quot;get help&quot; but nothing happened. There also other options (such as &quot;^O&quot; to &quot;write out&quot; -- what does this mean?) which I don&#39;t understand.

I basically do not know how to modify any of the information (IP addresses) it gives me. I have been able to change some of the numbers, but I don&#39;t know how to save those changes.

Also, underneath the text I quoted above, when I type &quot;sudo service networking restart&quot; and press enter, nothing happens.</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I’m presuming  you want to create your own Custom-Workstation, since you want to edit: /etc/network/interfaces We have a guide on that topic here: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems</a> in which everything, which needs to be modified in /etc/network/interfaces is explained in detail.</p>
<p>In regards to how to use the nano text editor, simply type in what’s necessary and when finished, press Control and X simultaneously, then press Y and Enter to safe the file. It’s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
