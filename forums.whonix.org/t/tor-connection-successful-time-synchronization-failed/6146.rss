Recommendations:

A) Rerun whonixcheck:

C) Manually set the time.

As last resort...

1. Open a terminal. (dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; Terminal)
2. Use the manual clock setting tool. kdesudo clock-random-manual-gui

<p>This looks like impatience. Was “only 90 seconds”. Only sdwdate iteration 2.</p>
<p>If censors throttle (slow down) connections, I can’t help with that.</p>
<p>If Tor plugable transports are slow, I can’t help either.</p>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be any censorship circumvention method that is<br>
fast on the horizon which at the same time is free, easy to use and<br>
easily installable from Debian package sources.</p>

            <p>Hi TNT_BOM_BOM</p>
<p>You will receive Tor connection successful notice before time synce success notice.</p>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#Overview">https://whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#Overview</a></p>
<p>Since sdwdate has failures it could be the bridges that you are using? Does sdwdate reach max number of failures with default (builtin) bridges?</p>
<p>What happens when you follow the other recommendations ?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">A) Already completed


B) Restart sdwdate.
dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; sdwdate-gui -&gt; right click on sdwdate-gui systray -&gt; Restart sdwdate
or in Terminal: sudo service sdwdate restart

C) Manually set the time.

As last resort...

1. Open a terminal. (dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; Terminal)
2. Use the manual clock setting tool. kdesudo clock-random-manual-gui
3. Simulate sdwdate success. sudo touch /var/run/sdwdate/first_success
4. Rerun whonixcheck.

            <p>I get this too with obfs4 along with other things like I have to keep restarting tor on whonix-gw because all my whonix-ws base vms lose connection and I cant browse any more. Dont know if its the update to torbrowser 8.0 or a different update that makes the problem.</p>

[e[31me[1mERRORe(Be[m] [whonixcheck] Time Synchronization Result:
Whonixcheck gave up waiting.

Time synchronization status: pending
sdwdate reports: Initial time fetching in progress...
whonix_firewall status: first run after boot

Possible issues:
- sdwdate will need a few more moments for fetching the time.
- sdwdate time sources might be dysfunctional.

Recommendations:

A) Rerun whonixcheck:
dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; Whonix Check
or in Terminal: whonixcheck
or in Terminal with debugging: whonixcheck --debug --verbose --gui --cli

B) Restart sdwdate.
dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; sdwdate-gui -&gt; right click on sdwdate-gui systray -&gt; Restart sdwdate
or in Terminal: sudo service sdwdate restart

C) Manually set the time.

As last resort...

1. Open a terminal. (dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: anon-all -&gt; Terminal)
2. Use the manual clock setting tool. kdesudo clock-random-manual-gui
3. Simulate sdwdate success. sudo touch /var/run/sdwdate/first_success
4. Rerun whonixcheck.
