    <description>After performing a dist-upgrade, both workstation and gateway came up with the following errors,

W: Size of file /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor_3%3a2.4-1_all.deb is not what the server reported 22468 154

W: Size of file /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/tb-updater_3%3a3.7.10-1_all.deb is not what the server reported 153338 16008

W: Size of file /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/whonix-repository_3%3a2.2.2-1_all.deb is not what the server reported 47782 16010

Is this something to worry about? The upgrade was performed on 31 dec.
Is there anyway to fix this?</description>
