    <title>Whonix hardening and Fingerprint</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-hardening-and-fingerprint/16030</link>
    <description>Hi, I harden my whonix-ws-16 with all the recommendations from Whonix documentation such as LKRG, Tirdad, Hardened Malloc, Hidepid, Apparmor, Security-Misc, SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener and I also disable the root account.

*But I am wondering:*
1. Does it affect the Tor Browser fingerprint? 
2. If I install proprietary software will it be able to correlate between 2 different devices where both are hardened?

I would be very grateful if you could help me figure this out

I am also experimenting with a similar one on Kicksecure, but I posted the question related to Kicksecure and Whonix in the Kicksecure forum as it makes more sense for it</description>
