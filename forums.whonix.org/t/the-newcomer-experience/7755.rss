    <title>The newcomer experience</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/the-newcomer-experience/7755</link>
    <description>I have a few questions for anyone who may have used Whonix as their first distro (or at least gravitated to it early on when learning the ropes with Linux):

* How long ago was this and/or what build did you start on? 
* What was the experience like?
* Were there any particular resources that you found helpful (documentation/videos etc)?
* What sort of resources do you think might have assisted you better?

Thanks in advance for any responses :slightly_smiling_face:</description>

            <p>Hi 0brand,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response! I enjoyed the trip down rookie memory lane, which I can certainly relate to!</p>
<p>I’ll be sure to further familiarise myself with the Wiki and the search engine during the coming weeks <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>

            <p>Hi <code>PitchinPango</code></p>
<p>Welcome to the Whonix community!!</p>
<p>I started out with Whonix 11/12 (or so).</p>
<p>What was my experience like? It was awesome! I’m here on the forum, testing Whonix and/or editing the Whonix wiki almost every day now. Like I said Awesome!!</p>
<p>I recently wrote about my first experience with Whonix which was also my first time using Linux.</p>

<p>The Whonix <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation" rel="nofollow noopener">Wiki</a> is chalk full of great info. I would start from the beginning and read a little bit everyday . The forum search engine (upper right hand corner of your screen)  is a great information resource as well.</p>
<p>Google Season of Docs will be winding up to the writing phase which should add much needed beginner documentation. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
