    <title>Monero GUI and stream isolation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/monero-gui-and-stream-isolation/4345</link>
    <description>Not too sure where to post this or how this could be done but I was wondering if it was possible to use stream isolation with Monero GUI? https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation

I tried using some ports that were already prepared (ports 9153 through 9159) which is without IsolateDestAddr and IsolateDestPort but that didn&#39;t work by this I mean it just hangs on Syncing and nothing ever happens. I didn&#39;t test the others that were listed.</description>

            <p>Please turn this into a non-Whonix specific question as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a>.</p>
<p>That is something along the lines "how to configure Monero GUI to use a socks4a or better socks5 proxy? Or “how to configure Monero GUI to configure Tor?”</p>
<p>Once you figured that out, please post the answer/reference here for review for Whonix integration purposes. (Sometimes it leads to Tor over Tor but I haven’t looked into Monero GUI.)</p>
