    <description>I get this same error every time that i open both gateway and workstation:

No audio devices could be opened. Selecting the NULL audio backend with the consequence that no sound is audible.

Details: Host audio not reponding....

But I have audio on my host thats working just fine...also I went into the settings and set the default audio for my host as the default for the machines...yet I still get this error....?

Whats the problem here?</description>

            <p>You can try the other available audio settings. See if any of these works.</p>
<p>Otherwise… It’s a rare issue. Difficult to fix from my perspective. As per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a> I would recommend wiping Whonix-anything from your question to reduce complexity, installing Debian in a VM, try if you can get sound to work in a Debian VM. Try to find help and/or report a bug then at the related project(s).</p>
