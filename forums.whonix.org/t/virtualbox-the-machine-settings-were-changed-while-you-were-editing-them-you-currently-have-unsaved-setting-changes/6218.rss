    <description>When booting gateway or workstation if I open the settings of the guest OS that is booting, this message shows up by virtual box &quot;The machine settings were changed while you were editing them. You currently have unsaved setting changes....&quot; whereas I haven&#39;t changed anything. I noticed this issue when opening settings immediately after starting gateway (or workstation). Along with this message, sometimes even the screen of the guest OS gets black and freezes! I wonder what exactly opening the settings window has with what&#39;s going on inside a guest OS!
Host is Linux.</description>

            <p>Sure let’s discuss this via email. Can you temporarily post (I will remove as soon as I see it) your address in an obfuscated way for spam resistance purposes?</p>
<p>Since you know C there are a couple of tasks we would appreciate your input on too.</p>

            <p>I’ve worked with QEMU and KVM a lot. Both with and without GUI. We all have to confess Virtualbox is still more convenient and user friendly with more features.</p>

<p>I hope you mean KVM because plain QEMU is emulation and that is mighty slow. Also as <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/algernon">@Algernon</a> mentioned, the virt-manager GUI should be enough for your needs. The Whonix wiki should help you for any Whonix specific instructions.</p>

<p>You don’t have to do everything via the command line. There is also virt-manager which is a GUI similar to VirtualBox.</p>

            <p>This is a VBox problem and is better reported upstream. VBox is known to be buggy. You are better off using KVM since you are on Linux.</p>
