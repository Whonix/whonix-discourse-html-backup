    <title>Need a riseup.net invite</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/need-a-riseup-net-invite/1266</link>
    <description>hi,
i&#39;d like to try the legacy riseup.net vpn for a vpn-gateway-VM. 
But i need a riseup.net account for that and in order to get one of these i&#39;d need an invite from someone already having a riseup account. 
Is here anyone who has a riseup account and would be so kind to send me an invite? I would really appreciate it.

I tried already the new black.riseup.net vpn but that didnt work.

What tried already:
1. I created a VM with a Linux installation and the black.riseup (bitmask) VPN connection
2. I made this Linux-VPN-VM the internet gateway for the Whonix-Gateway VM
.... but that didnt work. the whonix-gateway wasnt able to connect to the internet/or tor through the debian-VM with the black.riseup vpn running.

so now i would like to try the legacy riseup vpn for that. thats why i need a riseup invite..

I cant use the new (black) riseup vpn on the host machine..because it is not yet supported (only linux is) and i can not install linux on the host.

Edit: 
- In case someone with a riseup account and willing to send an invite reads this ;) -&gt; needriseupinvite@keemail.me

- And if someone knows how to make it work that the new riseup vpn (black vpn) works with the whonix-gateway or as a vpn-vm-gateway for whonix - Id appreciate help with that as well...</description>

            <p>I have a risetup account, so can probably invite people if any others want.</p>
<p>You don’t need the email to use their VPN though, I’ve registered for it without using my email, but it doesn’t work on Osx yet.</p>
