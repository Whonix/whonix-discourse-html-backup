    <title>[SOLVED] I can&#39;t get into my workstation!</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-i-cant-get-into-my-workstation/4478</link>
    <description>First of all let me say, I&#39;m new to debian So I dont know much about it at all. 

VLC media player wasn&#39;t opening, so I uninstalled it with &quot;sudo apt-get remove vlc&quot;. It did get removed but I wanted to be sure ALL of it&#39;s files were gone before reinstalling it. So I did &quot;sudo apt-get remove --purge vlc&quot;

After that, for some reason the dolphin file manager stopped working. When ever I tried to open a folder from my desktop, it would say, &quot;open with...&quot; and file manager was not an option.

I clicked on the KDE button down in the bottom left and tried opening file manager from there but there was no response.

When I shut down the workstation and rebooted it, It brought me to this screen:

I never had to login when starting up the workstation before, it would always open right up!
I have no clue what the host login is. I don&#39;t remember ever setting that up. Is there a default login that I don&#39;t know about?
Everything I try is incorrect.
Is there any way around this? Thanks for the help.

*UPDATE*

One of the logins I tried finally worked! But the workstation didnt open as normal. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?

            <p>Hey, thanks for the response. Unfortunately when I tried reinstalling vlc like you suggested, it did work. It said it was already at its newest version.<br>

I mean look at all the packages that it says are no longer required! Even I can tell by looking at that something is wrong.<p></p>
<p>Is there another way to get lost packages back? Or a way to re-install all of whonix’s dependencies? Is it possible to get out of the virtual terminal and boot the workstation normally?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>GuyInTheSky</code></p>
<p>You probably removed dependencies that KDE needs to function properly when you <code>remove --purged vlc</code>  .  If you reinstall those packages the issue you are having should clear up.</p>
<p>You can use a virtual console to install VLC.  Just in case you didn’t already know you were logged into a virtual console ( <code>tty1</code> ) in the last screen shot.</p>
<p>After you open and log into the virtual console run this command:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install vlc</code></p>
<p>You may have to reboot Whonix for the changes to take affect.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you should never remove packages unless you know it is safe to do so.</p>
