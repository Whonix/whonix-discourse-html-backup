    <title>[development] Why disable network-manager in Qubes?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/development-why-disable-network-manager-in-qubes/1104</link>
    <description>I wanted to work on:
&#39;disable rads, whonix-initializer and swap-file-creator systemd unit files in qubes-whonix&#39;
(https://phabricator.whonix.org/T315)

Before I re-implement that... Got a question...

[code]disableSystemdUnits \
...
network-manager \[/code]

Why is that? It doesn&#39;t interfere with Whonix networking that is using ifupdown. Does it conflict with any Qubes networking?

You might wonder, why is network-manager installed in Whonix by default?

From Whonix 8.3 changelog:
[html]&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall&quot;&gt;VPN-Firewall&lt;/a&gt; features have been added to Whonix-Gateway’s firewall in Whonix 8.3. network-manager-kde and OpenVPN is now being installed by default to aid users who want to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP&quot;&gt;hide Tor and Whonix from their ISP&lt;/a&gt;.[/html]


(So they can use these interfaces, these guis to setup their VPN.)</description>

            <p>Network Manager is only enabled for netvm’s, not proxyvm’s.</p>
<p>A netvm is a network VM that is directly connect to the LAN/WAN.</p>
<p>A proxyvm is what they label a  firewallvm; it routes traffic to and from AppVM’s via the netvm.</p>
<p>Whonix gateway is setup to be a proxyvm to give it one more level of protection and as a proxyvm it is also able to act as an update proxy for other AppVMs.  Whonix can run as netvm I suppose, but it is not tested at this point.</p>
<p>I have no current plans on enabling Whonix as a netvm at this point as I do not see any benefits, only drawbacks.</p>
<p>Someone could just re-enable network-manager, and it may work, or Qubes may prevent it from opening since it also has logic to only run in a netvm.  User can configure their VPN from netvm maybe.</p>
