    <title>Install Guide Update: Deny Unnecessary Network Access</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/install-guide-update-deny-unnecessary-network-access/476</link>
    <description>As pointed out on the Qubes mailing list, I had not originally included firewall rules for filtering out clearnet internet access by a compromised Whonix-Workstation.

This was a simple oversight as I had set up such clearnet firewall filtering on my own Qubes + Whonix machine and had originally intended to include it in the install guide.

I&#39;ve updated the current wiki install guide to include this new step &quot;Deny Unnecessary Network Access&quot;.

The primary concern that this step mitigates is if a person&#39;s Whonix-Workstation were to be compromised by an attacker, then, without added firewalling from Qubes, it would be able to bypass Tor routing through the Whonix-Gateway and access the clearnet via the Qubes firewallvm.

This newly added step &quot;Deny Unnecessary Network Access&quot; cuts off such potential clearnet access off from the Whonix-Workstation, which was the original intention to be included in the install guide.

This is updated and included now...
