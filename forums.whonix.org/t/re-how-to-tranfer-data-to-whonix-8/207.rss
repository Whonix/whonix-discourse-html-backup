Very spontaneous idea here (untested): How about loop mounting the vmdk from within the host, using the host (or its usb interface) to rsync or tar the data/config.

Hm, the way back *head scratching* ... Is a loop mounted vmdk writeable? If so (most likely negative though) we could rsync or tar the backup into the new system, boot, done.

As I said: a very spontaneous (not deliberated) idea. Shooting from the hip.</description>

<p>This time the javascript may be legit. Next time the javascript may store a copy of the key and send it elsewhere. In-browser encryption can only be secure, if either the browser itself or an add-on encrypts it. Until browser encryption add-ons get available and mature, you’re much better off using better vetted encryption methods, such as luks or gpg.</p>

You should NEVER mount it, but instead follow this section in the wiki Patrick pointed to : <span class="bbcode-b">Transfer files from the Whonix Workstation into a different Whonix-Workstation through a VDI file</span></p>

Sure, just keeping support for them builds a bridge for them to the Linux world. (I personally got involved into Linux because I used it inside VMs for a long time.)

            <p>While these are a lot of “this is bad”, it’s also motivating from my perspective.</p>
<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>vmdk loop-mounting<br>
a) thanks for providing lots of insights, i.e. sharing your research. do you think research is exhausted here already?<br>
b) from my perspective, if we’d come up with a solution for Linux-only, that would be at least one step forward. From my very own perspective, we should anyways promote Linux-only as a host OS, considering the goals of the project. Windows/Mac hosts are not suitable for a serious Whonix setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>virtualization solutions<br>
I can’t stress enough that we should anyways focus on the lowest common denominator here. Think about (so called) “developing” countries. They don’t have Quad-Core processors and lots of Ram, Sata Drives, lots of Bling Bling. That’s the reason I’m such engaged in LowFat Whonix btw. They have Pentium 4 machines, 1 GB Ram, IDE drives. If we provide some reasonable performance on these &gt; awesome! And also: Such a LowFat Whonix shines on a “developed” world machine too. Afaik, KVM urgently needs hardware virtualization, same for Qubes OS(?). If we concentrate on these <em>exclusively</em>, we’re cutting off 2/3 of the world’s population. Just my 0.02 $.</p>

Possible in theory, but there is only a non-free implementation of write access to vmdk images. I aggregated my attempts on finding a solution for this on this page:<br>

<p>We can’t deploy vdi or raw by default in .ova’s. VirtualBox does not support that. This is bad.</p>
<p>You can get your data out of an existing vmdk. But you need VBoxManage to convert to vdi first. You could then manipulate your image, add files, remove files etc. Even boot it again, but then you’d need to dispatch detach the vmdk from the VM first and then attach the vdi. Perhaps it would be best if everyone did that before using Whonix. Cumbersome approach. This is bad.</p>
<p>Mouting vmdk isn’t possible using Free Software. (At least not in Debian Jessie. There might be a solution that works in Wheezy but will break in Jessie since support was terminated. (Named virtualbox-fuse.) This is bad.</p>
<p>Whatever I attempted to fix this, I hit a wall. Unfortunately, I am not skilled to create a Free Software vmdk read/write mount driver. This is bad.</p>
<p>Eventually, when Whonix KVM support has been finished, mounting images gets simpler. But only for Linux users. (KVM is Linux-only.) And installing Whonix in KVM is more difficult than importing an .ova into VirtualBox, because KVM does not have a VM import feature. This is bad.</p>
<p>Whonix based on QubesOS could make file transfer and backups really safe and simple. But it will take a long time until we get there. Not everyone will be willing or able (hardware issues) to install QubesOS. This is bad.</p>

<p>Very spontaneous idea here (untested): How about loop mounting the vmdk from within the host, using the host (or its usb interface) to rsync or tar the data/config.</p>
<p>Hm, the way back <em>head scratching</em> … Is a loop mounted vmdk writeable? If so (most likely negative though) we could rsync or tar the backup into the new system, boot, done.</p>
<p>As I said: a very spontaneous (not deliberated) idea. Shooting from the hip.</p>
