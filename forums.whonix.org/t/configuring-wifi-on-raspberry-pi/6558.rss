    <title>Configuring wifi on Raspberry Pi</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/configuring-wifi-on-raspberry-pi/6558</link>
    <description>Hi all, my first post in this forum. Thanks for all your hard work here!

I have got Whonix GW booting OK on a Raspberry Pi but my problem is that I have an ethernet and a wifi interface. The idea is to have ethernet running to my router, and a wifi interface acting as an AP for clients to connect to. 

The config files all expect two ethernet ports, and that fact seems be hardcoded into a lot of the config scripts. I could maybe edit the scripts but I’m wondering if that’s enough or if I need to rebuild the kernel to be aware of the wifi interface?

Another related problem is that I can’t do much to install wifi drivers etc, because the DNS is not working (by design). But Tor is also not working because one of the interfaces is missing so I’m in catch-22 that I need drivers to get the networking up, and I need networking to install the drivers.

I’ve spent a couple of days fighting this and have run out of ideas.

One obvious idea I had was to somehow temporarily configure the gateway to run DNS over clear networking while I fix everything. I’ve seen a lot of interesting-looking flags in  `30_whonix-gateway_default.conf`  but I’m not sure if it’s even possible?</description>

            <p>Hi <code>echelon</code></p>
<p>That is a good question. <s>I’m having issues with that as well.</s></p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p><code>sudo -su clearnet</code></p>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/+1.png?v=6" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:">   I’ll update the documentation.</p>
<p>Done!</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/0brand">@0brand</a>, thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>Probably a dumb question, but I’m having trouble logging in as the <code>clearnet</code> user. I set up a password and was able to apparently login using <code>su - clearnet</code> but strangely the bash prompt and <code>whoami</code> are still reporting the user as <code>user</code>, and the network behaviour is unchanged. Any ideas what I’m missing here?</p>

            <p>Hi <code>echelon</code></p>
<p>You have a couple options</p>
<ul>
<li>install driver(s) from media</li>
<li>temporarily configure eth0 for Whonix-Gateway, download drivers …</li>
<li>download dirvers using clearnet, <code>curl</code> in Whonix-Gatway. The first threa should be helpfull (related). Follow all posted links in thread.
<ul>
