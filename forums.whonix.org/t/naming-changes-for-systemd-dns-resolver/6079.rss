&gt; * The systemd-resolve tool has been renamed to resolvectl (it also remains available under the old name, for compatibility), and its interface is now verb-based, similar in style to the other &lt;xyz&gt;ctl tools, such as systemctl or loginctl.
&gt; 
&gt; * The resolvectl/systemd-resolve tool also provides &#39;resolvconf&#39; compatibility. It may be symlinked under the &#39;resolvconf&#39; name, in which case it will take arguments and input compatible with the Debian and FreeBSD resolvconf tool.</description>

<pre><code class="lang-">systemd System and Service Manager

CHANGES WITH 240 in spe:

        * A new service type has been added: Type=exec. It's very similar to
          Type=simple and ensures the service manager will wait for both fork()
          and execve() of the main service binary to complete before proceeding
          with follow-up units. This is primarily useful so that the manager
          propagates any errors in the preparation phase of service execution
          back to the job that requested the unit to be started. For example,
          consider a service that has ExecStart= set to a file system binary
          that doesn't exist. With Type=simple starting the unit would
          typically succeed instantly, as only fork() has to complete
          successfully and execve() is not waited for, and hence its failure is
          seen "too late". With the new Type=exec service type starting the
          unit will fail, as the execve() will be waited for and will fail,
          which is then propagated back to the start job.

          NOTE: with the next release 241 of systemd we intend to change the
          systemd-run tool to default to Type=exec for transient services
