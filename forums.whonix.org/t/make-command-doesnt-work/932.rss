    <title>Make command doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/make-command-doesnt-work/932</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to install a tar.gz package and it tells me to:

[code]./configure
make
make install[/code]

However when i do [code]make[/code] it gives an error saying something along the lines of make command doesn&#39;t exist, if you want it install it.

How do i fix this? I can&#39;t find anything called make under apt-get.</description>
