    <description>I did a fresh install Whonix 15.0.0.6.6 / Virtualbox. I can get everything working great BUT then after all the updates are installed, it breaks Virtualbox Guest Additions shared clipboard. I have now done three fresh installs and this issue happens every again. All features of Guest Additions work on the first couple boots on both the Workstation and Gateway. Everything looks normal but when you paste nothing happens. It does not work from host - guest or vice versa. Shared storage drag and drop both work fine. Also updated virtualbox and Guest Additions but that has not working either.

I have been battling with this off and on for two days and I&#39;m really hoping someone knows how to fix this. I have read every related article via whonix, virtualbox and maybe Google too! :grimacing:

            <p>This sounds like it relates directly with my issue.</p>
<p>“Please update Whonix vbox guest addition modules”. Unfortunately I can’t link to it.</p>
