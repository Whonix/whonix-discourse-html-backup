    <title>No authentication on latest update packages running Virtualbox on Ubuntu please help??</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/no-authentication-on-latest-update-packages-running-virtualbox-on-ubuntu-please-help/1921</link>
    <description>Ok I am still very new to whonix and I am running it on Virtualbox on Ubuntu.  I have have noticed several things over the past month and wanted to ask about them in order of importance:

1) The latest update of packages came with a warning of no authentication so I did not install.

2) I have noticed that the frequency of new updates on whonix check update requirements is close to daily is that normal?

3) When I was first running whonix when I would run whonixcheck the exclamation point notification would come up and say the actual number of packages that need to be updated I remember on one update it said there were over 100 then after that update it now says that &quot;there are just packages that need to be updated.&quot;  Why did you make this change of not notifying the number of packages to be updated?

4) Lastly, I know that Ubuntu is not the most effective way to run Whonix but this unauthenticated update puts me at a cross roads because I don&#39;t want to run it without being up to date as I rely on your service for security, yet if I can&#39;t get an authenticated update I was told to never install kindly advise.

Thanks for all your work and help.</description>
