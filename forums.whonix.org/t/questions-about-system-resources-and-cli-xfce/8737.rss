    <title>Questions about system resources and CLI + XFCE</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/questions-about-system-resources-and-cli-xfce/8737</link>
    <description>I noticed when using both XFCE VMs they eat up most of my system resources, so I checked exactly how much they were set to use and noticed both the gateway and workstation were using 4 cores of my quad core CPU. Could I reduce this further to say, 2 cores? Maybe 3?

Also, I&#39;ve considered running the CLI gateway with the XFCE workstation but couldn&#39;t find any guides for how to do so. Not to mention that I would find it pretty intimidating to have to function entirely within the CLI.

I&#39;d have no problem changing the passwords and updating the software, but what else would I have to routinely do within the gateway? Would I still have to perform the Whonix check? If so, how would I do it? And what else would I have to do to use and maintain the gateway?</description>

<p>If you maximize that window you can select/unselect which VMs to import.</p>
<p>Or you could delete any VMs perceived superfeous.</p>
<p>Also the name of the VM does not matter much. The VM settings matter. If you start Whonix-Gateway-CLI and Whonix-Workstation-XFCE you have completed the process. This is because both VMs have the correct VM settings. Both, Whonix-Gateway-CLI and Whonix-Workstation-XFCE  are configured to use VM setting internal network <code>Whonix</code>. Whonix-Gateway-CLI  has an external and internal virtual network card while Whonix-Workstation-XFCE has only an internal virtual network card.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clarification. In that case I will leave the CPU settings the same. As you suggested, I want to give the CLI gateway + XFCE workstation a go, but I’m not sure how to combine the two. As explained in the original post, if I import one or the other, they import the gateway and workstation for both CLI and XFCE, so I’m not really sure what to do from there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m still confused as to how I could use CLI gateway + XFCE workplace and how many cores they need to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t reduce cores. Any eventual high CPU use issues should be<br>
fixed. Probably would be a bad idea to have Tor or applications (Tor<br>
Browser) be resource (CPU) starved as this might be fingerprintable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And to clarify, does RADS basically just use CLI or XFCE based on how many resources are available?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, how would that really help me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to use safe resources and are OK with CLI, reduce RAM. If<br>
you need GUI, increase RAM. What else is needed?</p>
