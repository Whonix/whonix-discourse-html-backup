    <title>updated my password but now system does not recognize new sudo password</title>

    <description>Greetings and thank you for your time. I need help with this problem.

So I set up whonix on virtualbox and followed the steps to change passwords (from changeme to new one).
Yesterday I attempted to do a sudo command and my password was not recognized. 

I then tried to boot with init = /bin/bash and changed the password again. This time I wrote it down on a piece of paper, typed it one letter/number at a time and kept it easy.
Although the system told me my unix password was updated with success...the damn password is STILL not accepted?

I am at the end of my rope with this one.</description>

            <p>Figured out my problem</p>
<p>init=/bin/bash<br>
mount -rw -o remount /</p>
<p>passwd user (added user as that is the default name on whonix)</p>
<p>and the damn thing worked!</p>
