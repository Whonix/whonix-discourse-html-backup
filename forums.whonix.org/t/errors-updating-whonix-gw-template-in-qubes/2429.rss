    <title>Errors updating whonix-gw template in qubes</title>

    <description>With a newly downloaded and installed whonix-gw template in qubes, it shows updates available in qubes-manager. However, doing : 

&quot;sudo apt-get update&quot;

...from within whonix-gw terminal , produces some errors. Most repos are contacted fine, but one of them causes an error like:

&quot;Error, http code 403 received from proxy after CONNECT&quot;

I don&#39;t have my qubes/whonix machine here with me so can&#39;t copy-paste it exactly, but the affected repo is something related to &quot;amd64 packages&quot;.

And because of this, it ends up with:

&quot;E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.&quot;

This glitch means that trying &quot;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; fails entirely, because the error is considered fatal and not even other updates will complete. Manually forcing &quot;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade&quot; will get the other updates, but even so, doing &quot;whonixcheck&quot; reports that it was unable to check for package updates, due to apt error 100.

Normal non-qubes Whonix running under KVM on Linux Mint has no issue, and updates check and complete correctly. Only whonix template on qubes is affected.

Can anyone/Patrick confirm that the repo in question is just offline at the moment, and if so, advise how to proceed? This has been the case for at least 4 days straight now, so it is not a &quot;quickly-resolving&quot; temporary problem.

Thanks!</description>
