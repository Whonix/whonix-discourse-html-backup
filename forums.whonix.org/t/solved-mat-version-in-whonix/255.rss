    <title>[Solved] MAT version in Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-mat-version-in-whonix/255</link>
    <description>Due to using the Debian stable repository, the MAT version in Whonix is old and doesn&#39;t contain lots of improvements.

Do you feel this is better because it is somehow more secure (stable) or would you like to include latest version but can&#39;t because ... or didn&#39;t even consider?

Look at all the changelog since 0.3.2: https://mat.boum.org/changelog/</description>

<p>For technical reasons as in programming challenges, not security reasons. Mixing stable and testing is difficult. Would require apt pinning, which is a bad idea as a distro maintainer (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/APT_Pinning">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/APT_Pinning</a>) and an okay idea for individual users. A technically fine method, yet too time consuming method [Whonix has no manpower for this], would be to backport the package from testing and to upload it to Whonix’s repository.</p>
<blockquote>or didn't even consider?</blockquote>
We considered this in general, i.e. mixing packages from testing with packages from stable, because this is quite a common issue. However, we did not consider it for the mat package in particular.
