    <title>File transfer between multiple Workstations, how?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/file-transfer-between-multiple-workstations-how/12733</link>
    <description>Hi. What is the most secure and convenient way to transfer files between two or more Workstation VMs? Whonix wiki doesn&#39;t have any information about this. I am not interested in connections between Gateway and Workstation, just between multiple Workstations. Is setting up an SSH server on Workstations machine and then use Secure Copy will be a good choice? Any risks that an attacker can reach my Workstation machine through SSH?</description>

<p>But that is not secure approach I guess because shared folders rely on non-free VirtualBox guest additions. More secure is to set up an SSH server inside one of Workstations inside internal virtual interface and then secure copy files to them. I think so. So could you tell me what is more secure?</p>

<p>Use KVM and apply the same concept. No closed plugins of any type are ever needed.</p>
