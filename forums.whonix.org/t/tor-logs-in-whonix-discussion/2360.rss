    <title>Tor logs in Whonix discussion</title>

    <description>Debian Tor default:
```
Log notice file /var/log/tor/log
```

In Whonix 12 we are currently using:
```
Log notice file /var/log/tor/log
Log notice syslog
Log notice file /run/tor/log
```

Do we want to log to `syslog`?

Logging to `/var/run/tor/log` is useful for two reasons. It&#39;s a shorter Tor log. Only since last reboot. And therefore it&#39;s better for [anondate](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#anondate) to parse that one.

Currently all with loglevel `notice`. Example: [1] Currently there are unfortunately many very similar spammy messages. So it&#39;s difficult to extract something useful from the log for both users and developers (such as when users post a log or during development).

Quote from Tor manual:

&gt; Recognized severity levels are debug, info, notice, warn, and err. We advise using &quot;notice&quot; in most cases, since anything more verbose may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.

Perhaps it would be useful to have an extra log that only contains messages of severity warn and err? I.e.

```
Log warn file /var/log/tor/log.warn_err
```

-----

[1] This is a typical log in Whonix-Gateway with loglevel `notice`.

<p>Yes it would make the logs more useful and probably faster to parse.</p>

            <p>Debian Tor default:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Log notice file /var/log/tor/log
</code></pre>
<p>In Whonix 12 we are currently using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Log notice file /var/log/tor/log
Log notice syslog
Log notice file /run/tor/log
</code></pre>
<p>Do we want to log to <code>syslog</code>?</p>
<p>Logging to <code>/var/run/tor/log</code> is useful for two reasons. It’s a shorter Tor log. Only since last reboot. And therefore it’s better for <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#anondate">anondate</a> to parse that one.</p>
<p>Currently all with loglevel <code>notice</code>. Example: [1] Currently there are unfortunately many very similar spammy messages. So it’s difficult to extract something useful from the log for both users and developers (such as when users post a log or during development).</p>
<p>Quote from Tor manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognized severity levels are debug, info, notice, warn, and err. We advise using “notice” in most cases, since anything more verbose may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it would be useful to have an extra log that only contains messages of severity warn and err? I.e.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Log warn file /var/log/tor/log.warn_err
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>[1] This is a typical log in Whonix-Gateway with loglevel <code>notice</code>.</p>
