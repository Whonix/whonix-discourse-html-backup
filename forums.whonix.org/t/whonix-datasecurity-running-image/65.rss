    <description>Hello,

this question is near to my other question: [url=https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,45.0.html] Whonix Datasecurity (Image).[/url]

Nearly same situation, I am out of the house and an attacker get local access zu my pc. 
But this time my Whonix system is already booted and running on the pc (For example to download something).
Before I leave the house, I locked the Gateway and the Workstation with: sudo vlock -ans

Is there any way for the local attacker to steal my data inside the Whonix?
If yes, please explain me the workarount how this is possible, because I do not see any way.</description>

The door is wipe open here. I doubt though that it’s the datacenters that are most vulnerable here.

I guess this very much depends on the datacenter. There are Tor-friendly hosts out there (see Tor wiki: friendly ISP) and quite to the opposite. An automatic "alarm" isn't too much of voodoo-thinking here actually . If the datacenter wants, it certainly can flag you - automatically - as a "troublemaker".

Well, my answer is still the same. I don’t have great answers to this. Any online shop may ask “how can I protect my customer database from data center admins?” After all, stealing the whole customer database has value. A competitor could try to poach the shop owners customers. Without the shop owner even noticing what happened. Looks like IT industry doesn’t have great answers for that.[/quote]</p>
<p>So for sure a full encrypted dedicated root server is needed, for minimal security.<br>
But also this will not bring the owner of the server in a good protected situation.<br>
I think this is totaly crazy, a server can hold thousands of customers addresses, phone-numbers, e-mails, credit-cards, bank-accounts and all this together with passwords. Also a free-speech forum post can bring you, in some countries, in jail if it comes to a deanonymization of your person.</p>

I do not have an answer to your question on running Whonix (perfectly safe) in a datacenter. I even doubt there is a solution after all - adrelanos mentioned a lot already in that regard.
<p>As of your desire to use it at work/at a friend’s pc, i.e. a portable Whonix if you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Debian on USB with full-disk encryption, except /boot + Grub</li>
<li>put /boot and Grub on some second unencrypted USB</li>
<li>then just install Virtualbox and import the DL VMs (Gateway + Workstation)</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup should be pretty safe (at least as safe as it gets with current technology) as long as you store the two USB away from each other and do not leave the running Whonix unattended.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,8.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,8.0.html</a> may be interesting for you if using such a setup. basically it’s a kill-switch for the full-disk-encryption.</p>

            <p>I agree with you in all points, but we have to decide between “100% safety” and “I do my best, safety”.</p>
<p>100% safety works like that:</p>
<p>Can I 100% trust Intel? No<br>
Can I 100% trust security firms like PrivateCore? No<br>
Can I 100% trust encryption algorithmen? No<br>
Can I 100% trust the Tor Project? No<br>
Can I 100% trust Whonix? No<br>
Can I 100% trust Adrelanos? No</p>
<p>So take your pc, laptop, tablet and your phone, open your BBQ grill, make a big fire and burn all this things to hell.</p>
<p>Is the door of your house unbreakable? Is the door of your car unbreakable?<br>
I think not, so do you let it always open, because it is useless to close it?<br>
No, you close your door, because you take the best protection that you have and maybe you buy a alarm for your car and maybe you buy a garage for your car, all this makes it a bit better, but far away from a perfect protection.</p>
<p>I think we should take the best that we have and try to make it a bit better (And discuss the howtodo).<br>
This is a big problem in forums like this, a lot of people answer all questions with thinks like “Brute Force can Break this” or “Thats useless against cold boot attack” or “The NSA is able to locate you anyway” or “A Trojan/Keylogger can steal your password”.</p>
<p>So paranoid people talk about paranoid scenarios. But this is not the real world, not everybody is Osama Bin Laden.<br>
The fact that they can do something, did not mean that they will do it (Time and Money is here the keyword).</p>
<p>Do you ever think about a VM inside a VM?<br>
I tried this, but only very short, because at that time VM in VM dont work fine (Not sure how is the actual situation).</p>
<p>But if this will work now (or in future) it could be possible to make a very secure full encrypted host VM.<br>
This special host could run the Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation inside.<br>
(I think the PrivateCore software is based nearly on the same idea).</p>
<p>This setup could be used/copied/transported on USB sticks, servers and unencrypted computers of friends, work or family and in any other unsafe scenarios. It is possible and usefull, in your eyes,  to create something like this?</p>

<p>I expect Intel to honor national security letters (NSL).</p>
<blockquote>So to hide this backdoor, for the hole world, would be nearly impossible for the US Government.</blockquote>
There are very few people who really understand sophisticated CPU design. I've read, that even their own engineers having the blueprints don't understand it all. Are there really so many people out there qualified to find such backdoors and really looking? Please don't just assume it. That can go terribly wrong.
<blockquote>And last but not least, if there would be a backdoor in it, the USA would use it for the "highest level top secret spy" and not for citizens they try to protect her privacy.</blockquote>
Not long ago, people though NSA does respect US constitution. Won't spy on US citizen. Those who said otherwise were labeled as conspiracy theorists. From what we learned thanks to Snowden, it's easy to extrapolate what they're up to. Also they did worse things in the open, such as war crimes. They're neither bound by ethics nor intelligence (which is in my opinion related to ethics).
<p>Currently I would translate their attitude as “fuck you! we wiretap all of you! what you gonna do about it? attack us? ridiculous!”.</p>
<p>When some day we would find out that all major CPU’s are backdoored by default, their attitude could be “fuck you! yes, we backdoor all CPUs. what you gonna do about it? develop your own one? ha! you’re only 30 years of research behind us. ridiculous!”</p>
<p>I am afraid to say, I wouldn’t be surprised and find it quite possible.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, it is a payed service, starting with about 500USD/month, so it is designed for big companys.</blockquote>
Companies are not to be trusted. Read how NSA forced Google, Facebook etc. to grant them direct server access?
<p>The question is, is PrivateCore privacy by policy (“we know our sources, we promise we didn’t add a backdoor”) or privacy by design “(even if we got a NSL, we could not comply for technical reasons)”?</p>
<blockquote>Also they have a great Team:
"PrivateCore management has solid security DNA. Oded Horovitz spent 5 years at VMware, where he developed vShield and VMSafe security products. His co-founder Dr. Stephen Weis has a Ph.D. in cryptography from MIT and designed Google’s two-step verification system. Right now they are the extent of the company, with former VMware principal engineer Dr. Carl Waldspurger on as an advisor.</blockquote>
Sure. Sounds great. No offense against them. I don't know them. But I don't give a lot consideration on such things. A great CV doesn't say anything about their current motives. I am sure, there are country leaders, Ph.D. anything who started wars and managed to kill thousands of people. I'd be more convinced, if they provided deterministic/verifiable builds, and if they could for technical reasons not betray others.

<p>It is sofware based, so no hardware needet.</p>
<p>You are right, that a CPU have to be trustfull hardware.<br>
But do you think Intel will risk his Company by building a backdoor in it?<br>
Any Government on this planet uses CPU and the CPU production is in China, India and other Countrys.<br>
So to hide this backdoor, for the hole world, would be nearly impossible for the US Government.<br>
And last but not least, if there would be a backdoor in it, the USA would use it for the “highest level top secret spy” and not for citizens they try to protect her privacy.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a payed service, starting with about 500USD/month, so it is designed for big companys.<br>
But  there is a Ubuntu trial for max. 5 Servers and I do not see any time limit. So if I understand it right, maybe it is free for small “private” users with only 1-5 Servers.</p>
<p>Look at this, sounds good:<br>

"PrivateCore management has solid security DNA. Oded Horovitz spent 5 years at VMware, where he developed vShield and VMSafe security products.

Right now they are the extent of the company, with former VMware principal engineer Dr. Carl Waldspurger on as an advisor.</p>

<p>I had a look on PrivateCore project and it looks very well.</p>
<p>The future is Cloud/Server based computing.<br>
Tor is a great project and Whonix is “The next big thing”, but both are build to be managed at home.</p>

<p>But I think about the curiosity of a Datacenter (For example the curiosity can start because of the Tor traffic)!<br>
I stay on the point, that if they dont like the activity of a customer, they have to delete the contract and the server.<br>
But they should be not able to read all informations on this server, if the customer dont want this!</p>
<p>I will read now about the PrivateCore project<br>

<p>Thats the point I think about and I am shocked about this.<br>
Because there is only security with encryption, but to run a system it is allways needed to decrypt the data.<br>
But a shut down system is useless and also it is not always possible to have full hardware controll, for example a company pc on work, or a server that is located in a datacenter.</p>
<p>So let us talk about a scenario where I store my Whonix on a Server in a Datacenter (For example running a HS).<br>
Is there no way to secure my Whonix against the access of the Datacenter Admins?<br>
And how easy it is to have a look on the HS data running inside the Whonix?</p>

            <blockquote>Is there any way for the local attacker to steal my data inside the Whonix?</blockquote>
Yes. Too many. Physical access by a skilled adversary - while the machine is running - even when running full disk encryption - is always fatal. For example, but not limited to, the Cold Boot Attack. Also other attacks exploiting interfaces (USB etc.).
<blockquote>If yes, please explain me the workarount how this is possible, because I do not see any way.</blockquote>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>this question is near to my other question: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,45.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> Whonix Datasecurity (Image).</a></p>
<p>Nearly same situation, I am out of the house and an attacker get local access zu my pc.<br>
But this time my Whonix system is already booted and running on the pc (For example to download something).<br>
Before I leave the house, I locked the Gateway and the Workstation with: sudo vlock -ans</p>
<p>Is there any way for the local attacker to steal my data inside the Whonix?<br>
If yes, please explain me the workarount how this is possible, because I do not see any way.</p>
