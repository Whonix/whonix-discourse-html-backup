    <title>Issues with connecting to the Tor Network.</title>

    <description>After running whonixcheck, the Whonix-Gateway-CLI won&#39;t connect to the tor network. It was working just fine until Whonix 14.0.1.4.4 was released. In fact, the previous version,  stopped connecting to the network and that&#39;s what prompted me to download the latest version.

After the initial boot-up it goes through the whonixsetup process, and then at the end of that when it runs whonixcheck automatically, it starts the following process, where it loops without ever connecting to the Tor Network.

**When I run whonixcheck it does the following:**

&gt; _[INFO] [whonixcheck] Tor Connection Result:_
&gt; _- Connecting for 0 seconds. | 25 % done._
&gt; _- Tor Circuit: not established._

&gt;

&gt; _(tor_bootstrap_status: Unable to authenticate: socket connection failed([Errno 111] Connection refused))_
&gt; _(check_socks_port_open_test: 22)_
&gt; _(Tor Circuit: not established)_

**After a few minutes I tried to run whonixcheck again and I got:**

&gt; _[ERROR] [whonixcheck] TOR Pid Check Result:_
&gt; _Tor not running. (tor_pid_message: Pid file /var/run/tor/tor.pid does not exist.)_
&gt; 
&gt; _You have to fix this error, before you can use Tor._
&gt; 
&gt; _Please restart Tor after fixing this error._
&gt;_...._

I&#39;m not a professional at fixing whonix, but I have used it for quite some time now. It looks to me like it might be a connection issue between the VM and the host.

When I installed the VM, I simply imported the CLI Gateway and its workstation into Virtualbox. Which I plan to remove the CLI workstation and use XFCE, which has not been done yet.

 Also When I try and run _sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; upgrade_ it tells me that hosts cannot be resolved. If you need more detail on this, I can get the exact quote.

I&#39;ve tried removing and adding the VMs, uninstalling/purging all related items to virtualbox and reinstalling from scratch, I&#39;ve even gone to the extent of starting from scratch by uninstalling and reinstalling Linux Mint as OS of host computer as well as try other flavors.

I&#39;ve checked and updated the time and date to make sure those weren&#39;t causing the issue. I am completely open to trying anything that could help. Please feel free to reach out as necessary.

If you have any questions about my procedure, or the way I have anything set up in relation to this, please let me know.

Thank you in advance.</description>

            <p>Anyone who finds this in the future, the issue was the medium I had installed it on. The SSD I installed it on had some corrupt sectors. Repaired it, reinstalled whonix, and all seemed to connect properly.</p>
