The fact we disable TCP timestamps and remove TCP ISNs is readily apparent.
[/quote]

The negatives of having TCP timestamps disabled (and other default TCP kernel options), especially in Gateway, is fingerprinting of linux-hardened users.

This is mainly problematic in Gateway since it is able to tie IPs to Whonix users by time sources, guard node or apt mirrors, but is also able to fingerprint Workstation to a lesser degree

This should be re-enabled but I would love to be proven wrong</description>
