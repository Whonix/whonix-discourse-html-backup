    <description>Private messages [are disabled on this forum](https://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-private-message-other-users/923). But improving efficiency and volume of communication between members could be greatly beneficial to the community and its largest common space is right here. Is it possible to set up private messaging so that only users that participate in the same threads with legitimate posts can message each other? That would probably satisfy +90% of the need for private messaging and eliminate nearly all abuse. For using other messaging channels you need to find public contact information which is mostly impossible. Also the [contactee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactee) can never be sure it&#39;s really the same person as on the forum. If the most active users fear being overwhelmed by private messages, they can exempt themselves. Maybe there can also be a time limit, but I&#39;m not sure that would be so good. I&#39;m aware resources are limited, this is just an idea I wanted to share.

<p>Also nowadays: Your legal interpretation of the law may be the correct one. Yet, you have to spend years of uncertainty going through the court instances until you receive a ruling in your interest.</p>
<p>It’s quite likely that such a case could be won indeed. But until then, one could likely face a search warrant, resulting in the seizure of all electronic information devices, i.e. all computers, hard drives, mobile devices. This is standard procedure. Yes, you’ll get the devices back at some point. Perhaps in 5 to 10 years. Yes, you may also win a recompensation case, in perhaps 10-15 years. Investigative custody is also likely.</p>
<p>In such a slow and effectively broken judicial system I choose to reduce legal attack surface.</p>

<p>Efficiency is achieved by having a low volume of high-quality information that’s public - so it can be documented and easily accessed by everyone (using multiple search engines). If you want a private conversation with someone, just ask.</p>

            <p>As an aside how could Whonix be held responsible for private messages? No matter the content they are not public and not sent by Whonix. It’s like blaming your ISP for the spam you get. If message blocking was available users could avoid this problem easily. Is the concern related to the country where Whonix is based at the moment? Which country is it based in, where is the legal stuff declared?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Private messages <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-private-message-other-users/923">are disabled on this forum</a>. But improving efficiency and volume of communication between members could be greatly beneficial to the community and its largest common space is right here. Is it possible to set up private messaging so that only users that participate in the same threads with legitimate posts can message each other? That would probably satisfy +90% of the need for private messaging and eliminate nearly all abuse. For using other messaging channels you need to find public contact information which is mostly impossible. Also the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactee" rel="nofollow noopener">contactee</a> can never be sure it’s really the same person as on the forum. If the most active users fear being overwhelmed by private messages, they can exempt themselves. Maybe there can also be a time limit, but I’m not sure that would be so good. I’m aware resources are limited, this is just an idea I wanted to share.</p>
