    <description>will be good for performance , for example is the only way to see fullscreen streaming in whonix with fps like in physicaly pc. But i thing can&#39;t use the gpu at the same time in host and guest , must &#39;&#39;mount&#39;&#39; it on guest, 
then maximize guest , in the midle if need to use host , must unmount gpu from guest and minimize guest for using host , but that may can do , imagine here all that we do for the &#39;&#39;sacrifice&#39;&#39; for the anonymity , so litle bit more clicks , but at the end , it will security risk?
*If is not need just to unmount the gpu but shut down the guest , that will be problem but how then we can use vga passthrough?</description>

            <p>FYI:<br>
Qubes by design does not expose real hardware to AppVMs for security<br>
reasons. And I think they are right in doing so. For example, network<br>
hardware is only exposed to NetVM. So any network hardware compromise<br>
would always be contained in NetVM only. Graphic cards should for the<br>
same security reason not be exposed to anything other than the host. [Or<br>
in future, a GuiVM.]</p>
<p>Some more development / theoretic speculation:<br>
If you have have multiple graphic cards, then theoretically you could<br>
connect the trusted/important[/slow] one to the host or GuiVM only. And<br>
a less trusted one you could assign to specific AppVMs as you need more<br>
performance there. Should that AppVM and graphic card [firmware] be<br>
[permanently] compromised, then other VMs and the host could not be<br>
compromised also by that compromised graphic card. But this is difficult<br>
to implement and to always enforce. Since such a maybe-compromised<br>
graphic card should never be reconnected to the host or GuiVM.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>first of all, GPU passtrough in general is only to be used on a system with more then one GPU. This could be two PCIe-GPUs or an IGPU and a PCIe-GPU. For the reasons you already mentioned, it is in general not possible to use GPU passthrough on a system with only one GPU. This however, is both not a Whonix problem and in general not a real problem, as it is the only way to use a GPU in a virtualized machine.</p>
<p>Regarding security implications, there isn’t really much I can say here, as this isn’t really a Whonix, but more a KVM specific question. There really isn’t any documentation (at least I didn’t find any) which focuses on the security of GPU passthrough or PCIe in general…</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
