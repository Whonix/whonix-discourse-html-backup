    <title>What is special in Whonix WS which gives one more privacy and which is lacking in simply connecting any distro to Whonix GW?</title>

    <description>As most of us know its possible to connect any Linux or Windows OS in a VB VM and point its proxy settings to the Whonix GW and that OS will be effectively torified as all traffic will go through Whonix GW, so I am wondering if I am building my own instance of some OS in a VB VM, say Arch Linux, how can I add the Whonix code to it to make it as robust from a Tor viewpoint as Whonix WS ?  I would imagine that Whonix WS gives the benefit of streams isolation, but what else?  How less secure am I using a Linux or Windows OS simply pointed to my Whonix GW?</description>
