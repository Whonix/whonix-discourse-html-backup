    <title>Irc bouncers and irccloud</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/irc-bouncers-and-irccloud/1546</link>
    <description>hello all,

I&#39;ve recently started using irc in whonix but have found it rather limiting because of all the irc networks that block TOR. I have found darkscience to be one of the exceptions but it does not a particularly large user base. I have been trying to find a secure and anonymous way to connect to freenode and came across irccloud which is a webbased irc client that also acts as a bouncer. I was wondering if anyone knows how secure this service is assuming i connect to the site with TOR. If it is not a service i can trust are there any similar products that are recommended?

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>since, thanks to Whonix, IP-Leaks are impossible, your IP can’t be leaked in any way, shape or form to this web page. I really don’t think, that there is more, which could be said here, since IP-Leaks should be the only thing, you would have to be worried about when connection to such a site.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
