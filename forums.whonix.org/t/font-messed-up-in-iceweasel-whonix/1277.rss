    <description>Hi guys,

I have an ASUS Zenbook UX301 with QuadHD 3200 x 1800 resolution. After launching Whonix in Virtualbox the font in the OS become messed up and I have to resize the OS font. The OS font is all good after I resized it, but on Iceweasel it&#39;s still messed up like in this pic:

On Tor browser it also messed up and not displaying web pages in the correct style. Does anyone have a solution for this problem? Will be much appreciated, I really love Whonix.

Thank you</description>
