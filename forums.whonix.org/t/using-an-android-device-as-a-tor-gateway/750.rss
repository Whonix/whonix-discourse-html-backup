    <title>Using an Android device as a TOR gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-an-android-device-as-a-tor-gateway/750</link>
    <description>Hi, it&#39;s my first post here,
I&#39;ve discovered Whonix a few months ago, and since then I&#39;m tinkering and thinking about different ways to achieve a good level of anonymity online. Whonix seems like an excellent place to start !

So, I was thinking about setting up a device for physical isolation of the gateway, like a x86 single-board computer, and, while it&#39;s not in the scope of what the Whonix team is trying to achieve, I also thought about using second hand android smartphones as small, cheap and customizable TOR gateways. 

It had to be rooted, and to run [url=http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/Replicant Status#Replicant-42]Replicant [/url]instead of the stock android rom. With this setup, 3g prepaid cards and the Orbot application, could this transform an android phone into a good TOR gateway, through USB tethering ? It also going to require some tweaking to disable the microphone, the camera(s) and the GPS, but it sounds like a good idea. What do you think ?</description>

<p>In theory, many things are possible. Availability of instructions and support to do so is another story.</p>
