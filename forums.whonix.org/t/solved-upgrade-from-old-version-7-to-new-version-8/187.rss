    <title>[Solved] Upgrade from old version (7) to new version (8)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-upgrade-from-old-version-7-to-new-version-8/187</link>
    <description>All

Am somewhat new to Whonix. I thought I read somewhere that the only way to upgrade from version 7 to 8 is by downloading the latest &#39;n greatest ~.OVA files and starting new virtual machines from scratch. Is this true?

Is there no way to [auto] upgrade versions of virtual machines without (pardon the PUn) virtually starting from scratch. I know how to migrate files from VM to VM but I&#39;d like to avoid reinstalling standard tools each time I upgrade.

When I execute &quot;sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrad&quot; I get the following error:...

W: GPG error: http://sourceforge.net stable Release: The following signatures couldn&#39;t be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY CB8D50BB77BB3C48
W: Failed to fetch http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/tor-0.2.4.x-jessie/main/binary-i386/Packages  404  Not Found

Suggestions/Comments/Help

Thx in advance.

PS: My thx and appreciation to Whonix developers - to date this is the best solution I&#39;ve found so far for hardened &#39;anonymous&#39; environment.</description>

I highly recommend against using it. Especially with Whonix. It's a RAT after all.
<blockquote>browser plugins</blockquote>
Also recommend against doing this, i.e. do not modify Torbrowser fingerprint.

            <p>Thanks, Occq, for clarifying the need for fresh start. Frankly I haven’t kept up with Debian releases over the years. But I can ‘appreciate’ differences between major releases.</p>
<p>As a [former] developer and Linux end=user typically I like a ‘standard’ set of tools: emacs, screen, compilers, etc… other development related tools.</p>
<p>However since Whonix’ mission is security and anonymity, typical tools I keep in my toolbox are: wipe, teamviewer, truecrypt, keepass, browser plugins, etc. I’ll need to make a script file to load these up every time Whonix makes major releases.</p>
<p>I assume then the error(s) I was getting during my attempt to ‘update/upgrade’ is because Jessie isn’t accessible any longer.</p>
<p>Thx again!</p>

            <p>Whonix 8 is based on Debian Stable Wheezy (7) and Whonix 7 is/was based on Debian Testing Jessie.</p>
<p>From Whonix 8 release notes:</p>
<blockquote>Sorry, upgrading from existing Whonix version (0.5.6, 7, etc.) to Whonix 8 is not possible.</blockquote>

<p>You need to download Whonix 8 .ova files to use Whonix 8.</p>
<p>Which tools do you find the need to install in Whonix? Software suggestions and preferences are helpful in planning which software to add to Whonix in the future.</p>
