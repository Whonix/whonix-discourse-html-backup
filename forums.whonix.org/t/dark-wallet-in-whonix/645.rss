    <title>Dark Wallet in Whonix?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/dark-wallet-in-whonix/645</link>
    <description>Hi,

I tried to run the Bitcoin Darkwallet v0.6.0 in Whonix, but got some problems.

Darkwallet by UnSystem: https://www.darkwallet.is/


I am able to receive and send Bitcoins and also stealth address works fine.
But CoinJoin never works and also the chat in the lobby never works.
This happens only in Whonix, but I didnt see any reason for this  :-\

So anybody get Darkwallet running in Whonix or know a solution for my problems?

Thanks!


@ Whonix Developers, you can have a look on Stealth Address function, it is a nice feature to make anonymous donations possible!</description>
