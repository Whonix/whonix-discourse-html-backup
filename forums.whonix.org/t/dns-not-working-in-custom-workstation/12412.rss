    <title>DNS not working in custom workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/dns-not-working-in-custom-workstation/12412</link>
    <description>So, i&#39;ve setup whonix gateway in KVM and then installed custom workstation (vanilla debian 10).
Now from workstation i can connect to hosts from workstation using their ip address 
(wget 1.1.1.1 connects, but shows error after attempting to set domain to some domain name)
But i can&#39;t use domain names (wget google(dot)com fails with  &quot;Name or service not known&quot;)
whonixcheck reports no errors on gateway and debian workstation is configured to use 10.152.152.10 DNS in /etc/resolv.conf

Edit: Also DNS work fine on gateway, but not on workstation</description>

<p>Installing external DNS resolvers risk creating privacy leaks. Search the wiki for how to use libvirt’s version safely to accomplish this instead.</p>
