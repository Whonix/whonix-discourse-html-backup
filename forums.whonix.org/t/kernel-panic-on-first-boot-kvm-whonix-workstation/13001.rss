    <title>Kernel panic on first boot - KVM Whonix Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-panic-on-first-boot-kvm-whonix-workstation/13001</link>
    <description>I installed the files according to the instructions from the website, the only thing that I did differently is that I edited the xml in order to keep the VM files somewhere other than the default location. Whonix-Gateway seems to work fine. 

I wanted to include a link to the picture hosted in imgur that shows the error message, but since I&#39;m not allowed to post links I&#39;ll just leave the code to the image hosted on imgur: 4YlTPoZ.png</description>
