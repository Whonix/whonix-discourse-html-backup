    <title>Freenet in Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/freenet-in-whonix/1022</link>
    <description>I was thinking on implementing the Freenet protocol and since Whonix is much more that just a Tor gateway due to its security hardening I thought maybe it would be a good idea to use Whonix as a base.  At the time of implementing freenet,  I would take into consideration other protocols that could also be added in the future. (So, make sure any changes required to allow Freenet to operate would be flexible enough to also be able to plug in others).

I imagine that a user would not want to use the same gateway to run both Tor and Freenet at the same time.  Am I correct in this assumption?  If so, then the user can run an additional gateway for Freenet, where Tor will be disabled.  This really would not be an issue in Qubes, since we can just set property on the virtual machine so that bot Tor and Freenet can share the same base template without modification.

The Workstation can then be modified to handle either type of traffic, specifically the browser and possible addition of disk encryption.

Does anyone see any issues with this approach, and if so, any possible solutions.</description>

            <blockquote>Nice!  Seems like someone created a Debian package a few years ago an abandoned it.  May be a good starting point for creating a new package that would also build freenet</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>You are so skeptical about everything :)</blockquote>
Yes, but not because I am evil, because breakage easily happens. ;)
<p>For qubes-9.x for example we now have the “stable rather than wheezy” upgrade issue as well as the “/etc/hosts immutable” issue. Once users run into these, those are difficult to resolve. Those can most times be resolved, aka “edit this postinst script, add ‘exit 0’ below ‘#!/bin/bash’” or such instructions, but that’s cumbersome for users to do and for us to support.</p>
<p>Maybe we have different assumptions, goals. My goal is to maintain a super simple linux distribution that is easily upgradeable, ideally without need for special commands other than the usual upgrade commands. Any package manger issues generates lots of, partly concerned, support requests. The more users, the more support requests.</p>
<p>We could very well end up in a situation where we need to say “no, you cannot [easily] upgrade qubes-whonix 9 to qubes-whonix-10 [unsupported]”. This is not the end of days, but bad. Then users wonder why that is and how to migrate and run into migration issues and so forth. And other users who stick with old versions and then create invalid bug reports. Otherwise we need to maintain special instructions for upgrading and then helping lots of users with special cases. Or just write the instructions and then give a damn about it. Let users figure out themselves and ignore the questions. All non-ideal.</p>
<p>I think non-clean solutions, packaging issues lead to a lot bugs that generate a lot extra work. Therefore it’s my strategy to try getting up real solutions [upstream] rather than distribution specific hacks and workarounds. Because those hacks and workarounds pile up. I fear they pile up to a state where complexity gets unmanageable. Each special case needs explanation, gets questioned every now and then, is prone to interaction bugs with other packages and still needs to be understood in two years from now. Therefore it’s my strategy to use existing tools rather than reinventions if sane, using standard tools, policy conform, lintian clean packages, again with the goal of having very few bugs, simplicity and no package manager upgrade issues.</p>
<blockquote>For the most part when dealing with packages and repos, etc salt uses the functionality of the distribution it is installed on.  Therefore it would be considered standard compared to non-standard I would think.</blockquote>
Doesn't sounds too bad.
<blockquote>and would also depend on the PITA factor of maintaining the Debian package for freenet.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I think it may be worthwhile to find out why it was abandoned in the first place.</blockquote>
Yes.
<p>By the way, there is this team that might be interested:<br>

<p>Once you created a Debian policy conform, lintian clean Debian package, they might takeover the regular maintenance upgrades.</p>

Currently I have 2 packages.   One that installs the latest 'supported (as in supported by my implementation)' version of salt
[url=https://github.com/nrgaway/qubes-app-salt]https://github.com/nrgaway/qubes-app-salt[/url]
<p>and the configuration files (which included installing them in proper locations)<br>

<p>Note the configuration files are still work-in-progress and are not finalized as this is considered a proof-of-concept at this stage, but they are mostly functional for Fedora, Wheezy and Jessie and are designed for Qubes dom0 and AppVMs at the moment.</p>
<p>The AppVM modules should also work on bare metal or other VMs such as Virtualbox.</p>

This also interests me as well.

<p>That is a good question <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I think so.  I downloaded it yesterday to check it out and seemed like a difficult task to secure and configure it so thought it may be a good fit to sit within Whonix since most all the functionality is already within Whonix such as firewall, etc and would be easier to implement a Qubes proxyvm using Whonix.</p>
<p>Not sure if its even worth while to do, so that prompted the topic question.  I would need to create a Debian package for it and provide some type of default configuration as well as a configuration scripts to enable / disable it which I was planning to use salt for that as I have already written a Debian and Fedora package for it as well (Hehe, was really thinking where else can I use this new salt package I put together to configure stuff <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>[quote]Freenet on the Whonix-Gateway (FreenetBOX)</p>
<p>Can be also potentially only be used parallel to Tor. It’s impossible to tunnel Freenet through Tor (see above). Also replacing Tor with Freenet is impossible, as freenet is a separated network, not designed to exit the network. Apt-get couldn’t work.</p>
<p>Not written yet. [/quote]<br>
The “see above” is apparently broken. I guess it was because freenet is UDP-only and Tor is TCP-only? You’ll soon find out, I guess.</p>

<p>The build script now supports --flavor whonix-gateway and so forth. Would be interesting to have a --flavor free-gateway or so that installs a different package selection. Or better separate flavors can be avoided and which mode could be configured in whonix-setup-wizard or a special boot parameter / hardware info (virtualbox setextradata alike) or so.</p>

<p>I will take a look at the links you provided, thanks.</p>
<p>I do believe you are correct in stating it uses UDP packets, I think i2p also has that limitation; too bad.  Maybe there are other networks it can be routed over other than Tor as most people would not have access to using a VPN to tunnel UDP traffic though Tor?</p>

<p>I imagine that a user would not want to use the same gateway to run both Tor and Freenet at the same time.  Am I correct in this assumption?  If so, then the user can run an additional gateway for Freenet, where Tor will be disabled.  This really would not be an issue in Qubes, since we can just set property on the virtual machine so that bot Tor and Freenet can share the same base template without modification.</p>
<p>The Workstation can then be modified to handle either type of traffic, specifically the browser and possible addition of disk encryption.</p>
<p>Does anyone see any issues with this approach, and if so, any possible solutions.</p>
