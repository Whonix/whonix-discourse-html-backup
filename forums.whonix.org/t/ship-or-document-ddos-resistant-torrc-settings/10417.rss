            <p>Hosting a high availability (“99,99%” online), let alone a high traffic one, load balanced (with onionshare) Tor onion service, certainly is non-trivial. Not something Whonix has researched and documented at this time.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ll research and document this anytime soon. Added a short mention here just now:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Onion_Services&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=60425&amp;oldid=59358">https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Onion_Services&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=60425&amp;oldid=59358</a></p>
<p>Documentation contributions for this would be very welcome. Would be the first step before considering enabling this by default.</p>

<p>Reported on Tor issue tracker yet? If not, this would be useful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Should also be suggested upstream to change these defaults to get input on potential consequences of that. If upstream changes this, Whonix does not have to.</p>
