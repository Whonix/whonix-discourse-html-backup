Looks like that feature is disabled in this forum.
<p>Options:<br>
a) upload to some free image hosting site and then share the link here, or<br>
b) register, create a ticket, upload here: <a href="https://phabricator.whonix.org/">https://phabricator.whonix.org/</a></p>

Please post a separate thread.
