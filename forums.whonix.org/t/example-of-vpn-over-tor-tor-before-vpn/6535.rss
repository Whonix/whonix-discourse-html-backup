    <title>Example of vpn over tor (tor before vpn)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/example-of-vpn-over-tor-tor-before-vpn/6535</link>
    <description>It is too difficult for me to set up. Is there any example or guide for a vpn over tor ( also known as tor before vpn) with any vpn provider? The cheaper the better but whatever...The problem is that the riseup vpn that appears on the whonix guide doesnt work anymore. It is driving me crazy and because it is a bit different for different providers I dont know how to do it. Is there any vpn provider where i can follow the same instructions as in the guide? https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN 


Thanks to anyone!!!

PS: Considering all the TOR Bans I think this is very important for Whonix and TOR.</description>

            <p>Hi <code>vpn-over-tor</code></p>
<p>The only tunnel setup example is <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Examples">https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Examples</a>. Other than that you may want to use the forum search engine (top right hand corner of your screen) to see examples of users that have successfully configured their VPN. It should not make a difference what provider you use as long as OpenVPN is used. Meaning as far as VPN setup.</p>
