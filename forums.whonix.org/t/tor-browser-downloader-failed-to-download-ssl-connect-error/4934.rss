    <title>Tor Browser Downloader - Failed to download [SSL connect error]</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-browser-downloader-failed-to-download-ssl-connect-error/4934</link>
    <description>I am aware of the topic posted recently with the same issue, but nothing I tried from there worked!

I did a fresh reinstall of Virtual box + Whonix today. Once set up, I ran the whonix check and did all the Konsole updates that it required.

The problem i&#39;m having is with tor browser.
When I open it, it tells me it is not installed, so I ran the Tor Browser Downloader.
The dowloader gave me a &quot;Failed to download: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/RecommencedTBBVersions&quot; error.

At the bottom of the error window it says,
&quot;(Debugging information: curl_status_message: [35] - [SSL connect error. The SSL handshaking failed.])&quot;


The only solution I have yet to try, is downloading manually... In order to do that, I need to access the &quot;Mannually Downloading Tor Browser&quot; wiki page. I obviously can&#39;t do that because tor browser is not installed. So the only option is to use the Firefox ESR browser that&#39;s built into the workstation.

Unfortunately I cant even proceed past the first step in manually downloading Tor Browser, which is:
&quot;Navigate to http://rqef5a5mebgq46y5.onion and dowload the Tor Browser for Linux.&quot;
How am I supposed to open that onion link without tor browser? When I click the link using Firefox ESR, I get &quot;Server not found.&quot;
 I&#39;m guessing because onion links cant be opened with Firefox... So i&#39;m stuck!

I&#39;m still new to this stuff so thanks in advance for the help!</description>

            <p>Firefox can connect to onions in Whonix.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>Set</p>
<pre><code>network.dns.blockDotOnion
</code></pre>
<p>To</p>
<pre><code>false
</code></pre>
<p>This could use a documentation enhancement (Whonix 14 requires the user<br>
to apt-get install firefox-esr to do that).</p>
