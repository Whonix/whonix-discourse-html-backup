    <title>Question installing Multiple Whonix-Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/question-installing-multiple-whonix-workstation/9141</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am new to Whonix and still new to linux and have been reading many parts of the WIKI about what Whonix is for/can be used.
Whonix is working well as setup by default description, so there is not problem.
I setup Whonix (non qubes), cloned the workstation, started the workstation, closed it and set up a new MAC address as described in the WIKI, started again the workstation.
Now trying to follow the WIKI &quot;Multiple Whonix-Workstation&quot;

Going into the terminal
I do have a problem in opening, changing and saving the file:
 
&quot;**3.** Edit the network interfaces file in Whonix-Workstation.
Open file /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix in an editor with root rights.&quot;
or alternatively (if I uderstood this correctly)
sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix

When typing in:
user@host:   sudoedit /etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix
I get several error messages like:
(mousepad:2125) dbind-warning**:10:39:23 517 error retrieving accessibility bus address: org.freedesktop.DBuS.error.Service unknown. The service name org.ally.Bus was not provided by any .service file.
And many more error messages.
The last line reads:
8 The style property GTkWidget:focus-padding is deprecated and should not be used anymore.........
But I could open the file at least.
What am I doing wrong?

Also, in the WIKI it is said:
&quot;Change the last octet. For example, change 10.152.152.11 to 10.152.152.12&quot;

Inside the 30_non-qubes-whonix file, there are 3 lines:

iface eth0 inet static
address
netmask
gateway

Does this means that ALL of those 3 should be changed at the end? Or ONLY the gateway?

It would be super nice, if anyone could give me a helping hand with the setup of an extra workstation, like giving me the excat line on what I have to type in.
Please be easy on me! I am learning and just starting with Whonix and english is not my native toung..
Thanks in advance for any help!

            <p>Hello, welcome to Whonix forums and thank you for your question!</p>
<p>This was clarified just now in the wiki.</p>
<p>Look for line <code>address 10.152.152.11</code> . Change the last octet. For example, change <code>10.152.152.11</code> to <code>10.152.152.12</code></p>

<p>Non-issue. There are a lot nonsense messages in Linux distributions unfortunately. See specifically <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Sample_Non-issue">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Sample_Non-issue</a> and <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs</a> generally.</p>
