    <title>Why Am I Getting So Many Captchas?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/why-am-i-getting-so-many-captchas/1795</link>
    <description>In Whonix recently I started getting lots of captchas on many web sites where I was getting much fewer before. Sometimes I&#39;m getting them in the same session. These captcha pages have a message like &quot;One More Step&quot; or something like that. I may have updated my version of the Tor browser around the time this started, but I&#39;m not sure about the timing.

Any ideas what could cause a big increase in captchas?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>this could have many reasons, like your exit node being more “problematic” (this could be resolved by reloading Tor), cloudflare having changed a few aspects of its system, etc. The best way to really prevent these,  in my eyes, is still to use a “clean” VPN on the  workstation, though this creates a permanent exit relay.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
