    <description>Dear Folks, i really need some help

I will try to write down the issue as exactly as possible

I normally opened Whonix, everything was as usual, after, i decided to open an existing database in Keepass2, which returned an error saying something like &quot;could not open specified file, file is corrupted&quot;. So i tried to open the file in repair mode as described on the Support-site of Keepass 2. 
This could not solve my problem, but i found a Thread with a problem similar to mine, which came to the solution to simply update everything. So i tried &gt; sudo-apt get update and `&gt; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade` on both, Workstation and Gateway. Still not able to open the file, so i decided to restart my laptop and try again.
Now i opened the Virtualbox and started both the Workstation and the Gateway at the same time as usual. But now, on the workstation there appeared a Site I&#39;ve never seen

The Site has the normal Whonix background, in the middle there is a grey window saying `welcome to debian at host`
On the left Side i can choose some entries like &#39;&#39;Anonymous remailer master, backup, bin, daemon etc..&quot;, on the right side i could input an username and a password, but it doesn&#39;t accept my username and password.

If someone could help me to log into my Whonix again, I&#39;d be really thankful, because I have like all of my passwords in the Keepass inside my Whonix-Workstation. 

Thank you for your help

            <p>Hey everyone</p>
<p>I was able to find and extract my data using the shared folder function. It looks like everything went well, although i did not test the Keepass-Database yet but it seems my Whonix-related problems are solved for now.</p>
<p>Here is how i could find and copy my data, if it is of any use to anyone</p>
<p>I setup the Shared Folder as described in here<br>

<p></p>
<p>After that, i got into the Console in my Workstation and used <code>find . -iname new\*</code> to search for the Document i wanted to find, because i knew the name was something like NewDatabase, and there it was, NewDatabase.kdbx, the file i searched for.</p>
<p>Next i used readlink -f NewDatabase.kdbx to get the full path of the Document, which was /home/user/Documents/NewDatabase.kdbx</p>
<p>Having found the full path of my Database, and knowing there were a couple of other Documents in the Folder i decided to copy the whole Folder Documents into the Shared Folder using <code>sudo cp -R /home/user/Documents /mnt/shared</code><br>
Now what’s left to do is to setup a new Whonix-Workstation, which i definitely will do tomorrow, and hoping i don’t get into such a situation again…</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>, <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/entr0py">@entr0py</a> for your big help, as a newbie I learned a lot, really appreciate it.<br>

<p>There are a lot of things going on in the console but it results in the same situation as before. If i set the Ram below 400 MB, Whonix will start into a Console, if i set the RAM higher I’m at the same Screen i started on.</p>
<p>Set up a shared folder now as you advised. I’m like 99% sure all the data I need from the Workstation is in one folder. So now i need to move that folder into my shared folder using the console Assuming I know the path of the folder i need, this should be possible right?</p>

<p>Do you generally know how to get into a virtual console? I mean, can you take any fully functional (new) Whonix VM and get into a virtual console there? If the answer is…</p>
<ul>
<li>no -&gt; figure that out first</li>
<li>yes, but it does not work in the broken VM…</li>
</ul>
<p>use rads:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter</a></p>
<p>Or total hack, lower the amount of the VMs RAM to let’s say 400 MB. Then no gui will start and you will more likely to log into a virtual console (since nothing else is offered then).</p>

            <p>It seems like this could be the same error as mine, yes<br>
And after reading the other Thread, it might be possible that i used autoremove shortly before this issue happened.<br>
I tried to open a virtual console using RightCtrl+F1 to fix eventual broken dependecies like you suggested, but this doesn’t seem to work either because i can’t open the virtual console<br>
I also exported the workstation to prevent further damage like you said in the other Thread</p>
<p>any suggestions why the virtual console doesn’t work or how to proceed?</p>

            <p>Once logged into a virtual console, it might help to rename the KDE data dirs in the home folder. Perhaps if you login again KDE will work (starting with defaults again). Uncertain. It might also help to undo the packages (you may have) installed that lead to this issue.</p>

( <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a> )</p>
<p>Probably best to start over with a newly imported Whonix-Workstation and then avoiding into getting this mess again (installing alternative gui packages).</p>

            <p>Dear Folks, i really need some help</p>
<p>I will try to write down the issue as exactly as possible</p>
<p>I normally opened Whonix, everything was as usual, after, i decided to open an existing database in Keepass2, which returned an error saying something like “could not open specified file, file is corrupted”. So i tried to open the file in repair mode as described on the Support-site of Keepass 2.<br>
This could not solve my problem, but i found a Thread with a problem similar to mine, which came to the solution to simply update everything. So i tried &gt; sudo-apt get update and <code>&gt; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code> on both, Workstation and Gateway. Still not able to open the file, so i decided to restart my laptop and try again.<br>
Now i opened the Virtualbox and started both the Workstation and the Gateway at the same time as usual. But now, on the workstation there appeared a Site I’ve never seen</p>
<p>The Site has the normal Whonix background, in the middle there is a grey window saying <code>welcome to debian at host</code><br>
On the left Side i can choose some entries like ''Anonymous remailer master, backup, bin, daemon etc…", on the right side i could input an username and a password, but it doesn’t accept my username and password.</p>
<p>If someone could help me to log into my Whonix again, I’d be really thankful, because I have like all of my passwords in the Keepass inside my Whonix-Workstation.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help<br>
