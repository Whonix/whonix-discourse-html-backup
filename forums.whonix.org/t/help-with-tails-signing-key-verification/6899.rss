    <title>Help with Tails signing key verification</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/help-with-tails-signing-key-verification/6899</link>
    <description>Please help me verify the Tails signing key. Without having access to the web of trust, I&#39;m trying to collect fingerprint data from multiple sources to be more certain that I&#39;ve downloaded the authentic key from the Tails website. If you have it in your keyring, would you please paste the data about it from the output of this command:

$ gpg --with-fingerprint --with-subkey-fingerprints --list-keys

That would allow me to gain some trust in it by comparing the primary and all subkey fingerprints with the ones from the key I&#39;ve got.

If you don&#39;t have it in your keyring, would you please download it from https://tails.boum.org and use the same command, changing --list-keys with [path to key file] and pasting its output instead. That would still be helpful. Thanks to all who help!</description>
