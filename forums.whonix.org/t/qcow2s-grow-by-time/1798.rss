    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/qcow2s-grow-by-time/1798</link>
    <description>i have installed kvm on fedora 21 i386 , with all updates &amp; upgrades and latest whonix there with all updates &amp; upgrades, on 1TB 5400 rpm hdd with luks full disk encryption.
So in the beginning i was notice the qcow2 in /var/lib/libvirt/images/  they was 101.9 GB with dolphin , and with thunar file manager they showing 100 GB if i remember right , yes , and now with dolphin the gateway   showing 101.9 GB and workstation showing 104,2 GB  ? I know for sparse files and i follow exactly the directions in kvm whonix documentation for copy\move     the sparse files , but ? they will grow more ? OR THEY NOT PHYSICALLY GROW BUT SHOWING IN FILE MANAGER LIKE GROW ?</description>
