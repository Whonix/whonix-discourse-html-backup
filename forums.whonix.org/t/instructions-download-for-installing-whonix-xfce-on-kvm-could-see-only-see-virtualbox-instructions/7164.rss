    <title>Instructions + download for installing whonix xfce on kvm? Could see only see virtualbox instructions</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/instructions-download-for-installing-whonix-xfce-on-kvm-could-see-only-see-virtualbox-instructions/7164</link>
    <description>First time around I just want to get setup and had trouble initially with the kvm way but so I just ended up going with virtualbox but I want to figure the kvm way properly now for the reasons stated in the wiki- that is is properly FOSS- and I prefer its more stripped down nature in general. I now have the time and inclination to getting it cracked. I have used kvm in the past but have just used it via making my own shell scripts with the commands to run a vm, not using virsh. 

I actually prefer that way but I guess it would not be practical here since the virsh xml files contain a lot of the setup info? and it would be cirtcuitous to do it that way for setting the gateway and workstation up?

Also can I do cli-gateway and xfce-worstation because I think it is superfluous to have a desktop for the gateway since it is not used.

My general philosophy is in line with linux philosophy of most simple and efficient so it was good to see that xfce was being considered to replace kde.

Where should I get the latest downloads for cli-gateway and whonix-xfce? and corresponding info on how to setup?

Also regarding encryption, would you need to setup an encrypted partition and just setup kvm within that? rather than there just being a simple switch like in virtualbox for kvm which deals with encryption?</description>

<p>Use a password manager in the WS like keepassx which we now include I believe. Then regularly make backups of the encrypted manager database and archive that.</p>

            <p>You could enable clipboard sharing if you accept the risks (=the Workstation has access to the host’s clipboard content and vice-versa).<br>
Otherwise I guess you could create a veracrypt container with your passwords inside on your host (or if your are really paranoiac, you could create it on a machine without internet access, then copy it to the host) that you would access from the Workstation with a shared folder.</p>

<p>Still use clipboard just with due diligence or is there a more advised way?</p>
<p>I will prefer not to compromise security as the clipboard ‘pilfering’ is a valid one from a best practices point of view.</p>

<p>Clipboard sharing is disabled by default for security reasons as per official documentation:</p>

<p>SPICE allows accelerated graphics and clipboard sharing.

<p>You can easily enable it if you want to (be aware of the security implications):</p>

<p>Sorry this applies to the virtual machine manager gui which you should have installed as per wiki instructions. In this network pane you will see all virtual networks and can manipulate them from there.</p>

            <p>I am tied up in a bit of a mess here with libvirt commands</p>
<pre><code>$  virsh -c qemu:///system net-define Whonix_external*.xml
error: Failed to define network from Whonix_external_network-14.0.1.4.4.xml
error: operation failed: network 'external' already exists with uuid 417ba234-1cde-4fbb-8837-417a0b6453a
</code></pre>
<p>I have already undefined and deleted the old attempt/previous version from many months ago but how do I get rid of all this net stuff because it is conflicting with this current attempt.</p>
<p>I was not sure what I need to search for online and c+p of the error didn’t bear and fruit on my cursory inspection.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I guess it is a good idea to run it in a stock way as per the base instructions before trying the more exotic builds/flavors as to qemu commands and the like.</p>
<p>Ah so xfce is the standard DE now with this download link in the KVM instructions? I presume so since it gives xfce troubleshooting at the bottom. As I was reading around forum posts a couple days ago I didn’t hit on any message that it had actually been rolled out and was still much in development stage; maybe I just didn’t reach to the latest posts as I was only skimming around :).</p>
<p>Yes I already knew the KVM install link it was just that when I tried initially, maybe 8-9 months ago, KDE was still the default.</p>
<p>Cool. I shall start again from the top with the wiki and concern myself with my other issues later if needed. It might be moot now anyway, regarding the cli version since xfce is lightweight anyway so that circumvents the original concern such as to now be a non-issue.</p>

<p>Also regarding encryption, would you need to setup an encrypted partition and just setup kvm within that? rather than there just being a simple switch like in virtualbox for kvm which deals with encryption?</p>

</aside>
<p>You setup a partition and just move the image there and point the VM settings to the alternate location. It would be easier to just encrypt your entire host to begin with.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Yes! 
Both Whonix CLI and Whonix XFCE exist. 
Technically, both Whonix-Gateway-CLI with Whonix-Workstation-XFCE are using virtual network Whonix. That’s why these can be easily, seamlessly combined.

Non-Qubes-Whonix vs Qubes-Whonix 

This announcement mostly concerns <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Non-Qubes-Whonix" rel="nofollow noopener">Non-Qubes-Whonix</a>.
Qubes-Whonix is largely unaffected because Qubes’ desktop environment choice (XFCE vs KDE) relies on dom0. Qubes-Whonix default applications will most likely change from KDE…

            <p>First time around I just want to get setup and had trouble initially with the kvm way but so I just ended up going with virtualbox but I want to figure the kvm way properly now for the reasons stated in the wiki- that is is properly FOSS- and I prefer its more stripped down nature in general. I now have the time and inclination to getting it cracked. I have used kvm in the past but have just used it via making my own shell scripts with the commands to run a vm, not using virsh.</p>
<p>I actually prefer that way but I guess it would not be practical here since the virsh xml files contain a lot of the setup info? and it would be cirtcuitous to do it that way for setting the gateway and workstation up?</p>
<p>Also can I do cli-gateway and xfce-worstation because I think it is superfluous to have a desktop for the gateway since it is not used.</p>
<p>My general philosophy is in line with linux philosophy of most simple and efficient so it was good to see that xfce was being considered to replace kde.</p>
<p>Where should I get the latest downloads for cli-gateway and whonix-xfce? and corresponding info on how to setup?</p>
