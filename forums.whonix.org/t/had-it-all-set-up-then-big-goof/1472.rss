    <description>Okay, I managed to get the default PGP client working and everything was all set up,  However, I feel I have made a tragic mistake.  Being new to whonix I followed the pw change for the gateway to a new pw (which I thought I remembered) then I noticed on the second run it auto logged me in I was unaware that it always auto logs you in so I was thinking that the gateway pw change didn&#39;t take so I changed it again and it allowed me to change it again.  Now when I try to adjust the firewall settings it actually asks me for the gateway pw and I have been trying to type in all possible combinations of the passwords I have chosen yet none of them seem to take.  Is there any kind of work around for this??  I mean I guess I could just use it as is and not have pw permissions but is there any kind of solution for this??  God I feel so foolish.</description>

            <p>Easy:<br>
Start fresh. Delete/re-get the image.</p>
<p>Harder:<br>
As per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a> these passwords can be reset by booting from a (virtual) boot cd and then accessing the system disk.</p>
