    <description>Took note of a few interesting features after I imported a sandbox gateway.
Why does Whonix Gateway have the following features in Virtualbox:
-100G HD? Granted, it&#39;s not allocated but 100G for a gateway is still way overkill.
-Floppy and CD/DVD enabled, despite the fact that floppy drives in virtual machines can be serious issues (VENOM for example)?
-Sound card?
-Guest additions? As far as I can tell, they&#39;re not good for much else then sharing clipboard when copying private keys for hidden services. And that doesn&#39;t always work either. Common sense should say that leaving open surfaces to the host system like this can be catastrophic.
-GUI enabled by default?
The gateway should be just that, a gateway which you normally don&#39;t touch unless when you perform updates or run a hidden service.</description>

So what is the problem with that? :)

<p>Doing this by default is not so useful. Security vs usability. Whonix VirtualBox has no longer a dedicated maintainer. Security wise, VirtualBox is not great anyhow. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Advanced_Security_Guide#VirtualBox_2">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Advanced_Security_Guide#VirtualBox_2</a>) That’s why my main focus in now on Qubes.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>the GUI may be disabled or enabled by changing the RAM assigned to the VM when importing the Gateway. The user may choose for himself. Regarding the guest additions, read this: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions</a></p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
