    <title>In log files: &quot;Domain id=2 is tainted: host-cpu&quot; --- Serious problem?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/in-log-files-domain-id-2-is-tainted-host-cpu-serious-problem/7345</link>
    <description>In my log files for both the gateway and workstation, located here on my host:

/var/log/libvirt/qemu/Whonix-Gateway.log
/var/log/libvirt/qemu/Whonix-Workstation.log

Every time I boot the machines, these warning messages appear in the logs:

Domain id=2 is tainted: host-cpu

Happens for both gateway and workstation. They both still boot and everything appears functional. But I am wondering if there are leaks or my anonymity is compromised. Thanks for input.</description>

            <p>Having read this from the Whonix FAQ…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is unhelpful to ask questions in forums, issue trackers and on various mailing lists with concerns that have already been discussed, or which are known issues / false positives. In all cases, please first search thoroughly for the result that was found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize this warning message from the logs probably isn’t critical, but if someone could generally point out what this message means, would be nice. I have used virt-manager to enable a shared folder - could this warning message be related to having files in that shared folder that come from host, and those have “tainted” the Whonix VMs?</p>
