            <p>It does look quite interesting, but my exact concerns were expressed in the comments. Because all the providers are based in the USA, they can be compromised without being legally able to disclose it.</p>
<p>Maybe if they added a warrant canary of some sort? Maybe one where it invalidates all certs?</p>
<p>I donâ€™t really know, but I can say that I very much enjoy seeing the project, and hopefully more like them will pop up. Getting encryption into the hands of more people is always a good thing in my book.</p>
