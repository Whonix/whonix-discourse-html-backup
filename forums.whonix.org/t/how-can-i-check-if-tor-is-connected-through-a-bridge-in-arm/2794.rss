    <title>How can I check if Tor is connected through a bridge in &quot;Arm&quot;</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-can-i-check-if-tor-is-connected-through-a-bridge-in-arm/2794</link>
    <description>Hello,

Just wanted to know how can I check to see if Tor is connected through bridges I&#39;ve defined in torrc? I added 3 bridges in torrc but still the 3rd option in &quot;Whonix connection wizard&quot; (Tor is censored or dangerous in my area) is disabled. I&#39;ve tried running tor via first option and checked Arm to see if bridges working but it seems to me that there is a problem as it shows bridge available but get bridge line didn&#39;t parse error. How can I be sure that my connection is through one of the pre-defined bridges? or how can I make the 3rd option in Whonix connection wizard available?

thanks in advance</description>

<p>It is as secure as you can reasonably get Tor.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for fast response,</p>
<p>I’ve checked my torrc and “UseBridge 1” is uncommented as it should be, so you mean by this Tor I forced it to connect through bridge at the first tier? Is it for sure ?.</p>

<p>The <code>UseBridges 1</code> option makes sure Tor only connects to bridges. Checking this is difficult. Use a bridge firewall ( corridor ) and/or a network analyizer.</p>

<p>This is expected. That option is not implemented. It only shows a tooltip when you hover over that option by mice. That’s all.</p>

<p>That is fine after you added bridges to torrc. However, all it does is commenting in <code>DisableNetwork 0</code> in torrc.</p>

<p>Don’t worry too much about arm, it has many usability issues: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller#Arm_FAQ">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller#Arm_FAQ</a></p>

<p>Dunno what you mean by pre-defined bridges.</p>

<p>how can I make the 3rd option in Whonix connection wizard available?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(as explained above why…) You cannot.</p>
