    <title>Unable to download whonix</title>

    <description>Hi

How come all my download attempts of whonix is failing?

No matter which kind of browser, internet connection, or download manager i try, it fails, by getting stuck at 5% 7% or if i am lucky 10%. I have even tried sitting in front of my browser clicking retry as many times as it stops. But in the end what happens is that it just choose to start from 0% again when i have clicked retry alot of times

If have no problems downloading files, and even OS&#39;es that are more than 4GB from other sites

So it might likely be whonix who has troubles with the server that is hosting the file?</description>
