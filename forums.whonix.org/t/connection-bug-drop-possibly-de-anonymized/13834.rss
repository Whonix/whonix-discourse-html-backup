    <title>Connection bug/ drop = possibly de-anonymized?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/connection-bug-drop-possibly-de-anonymized/13834</link>
    <description>hello, i was reading documentation about using tor and clearnet in same time in one network and now i&#39;m a confused, i have read some post here also but its not really clear, at least i&#39;m not sure.

So my understanding is that to be safe on tor, nothing except tor must be connected to the network, so not any other computer, phone. 

Because:
-Most websites are centralized in clouds like google
-Any connection can have some bug and drop sometime, even if it&#39;s short and rare, we better all assume this fact
In this case, if a tor connection and a clearnet one stop in the same time, it would be easy to de-anonymize a user for advanced adversaries.

Thats&#39;s right? Looks like a pretty dangerous threat
In this case i think that phone are a real danger since most have connected app, like google and social medias.
VPNs could also be dangerous if monitored.

Also, on host (debian) i guess there are some process that use the internet, is it a risk too?</description>

            <p>Yes, ideally there would be only Tor traffic and no clearnet traffic.</p>
<p>This would require something like <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host" class="inline-onebox">Whonix-Host Operating System Live ISO, Whonix-Host Installer</a> but it doesn’t exist yet at time of writing and there is no estimated time of arrival either. Help welcome.</p>

<p>For wider input, you could remove Whonix from the question, make it a question about the Tor Browser Bundle and ask in more general Tor / anonymity places.</p>
