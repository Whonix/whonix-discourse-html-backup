<p>But it will be difficult for anyone to troubleshoot without knowing the site in question. At least would help to know which captcha mechanism you’re talking about.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Then I don’t really know what’s going on here. Usually Allowing Scripts globally should have the same effect as disabling the AddOn, though without changing the base fingerprint…</p>
<p>Either way, may I recommend to you asking this question on Stackexchange, as we don’t modify the Tor Browser Bundle in any way, shape or form anyways: <a href="http://tor.stackexchange.com">http://tor.stackexchange.com</a></p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>There are two options:<br>
Allow scripts globally (Dangerous)<br>
Forbid scripts globally (Advised)</p>
<p>I have my browser set on allow scripts globally</p>
<p>Maybe is there anything in option menu that blocks it?</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Are you certain you had JavaScript active before? Because usually NoScript is what is used to block JS and from the sounds of it, you hadn’t Enabled Global Scripts with it which is what caused this.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

<p>Usually reloading the connection should help. Also, in some cases, sadly, activating JavaScript is necessary due to the way some “DDOS-Protection-Services” are designed.</p>
