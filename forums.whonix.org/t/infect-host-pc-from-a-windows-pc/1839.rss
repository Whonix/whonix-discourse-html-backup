    <description>I have downloaded Whonix from an internet cafe.
The computer into the internet cafe  had Windows 7  OS.
Now  my question is: Let&#39;s assume that the internet cafe pc had a  malware...   when i have downloaded whonix into my USB and then after i have plugged  the usb into my Linux pc,  do i have contracted the  malware too?
I am  not  sure if the internet cafe pc had a malware, but  i am  wondering what would be happen if it had it and then i&#39;d plugged the usb into my linux pc...the  malware could attakk my linux pc?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>not very likely. There only exists a hand full of malicious programs, able to replicate themselves from Windows to a Linux system and still be functional. What can happen though is that the cafe, for one reason or another, has (intentionally or unintentionally) corrupted the Whonix images, which is why you should always verify it.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
