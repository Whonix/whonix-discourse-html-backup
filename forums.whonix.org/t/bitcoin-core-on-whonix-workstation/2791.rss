    <title>Bitcoin core on Whonix workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/bitcoin-core-on-whonix-workstation/2791</link>
    <description>Lets assume one is running bitcoin core inside a Whonix worksation, for others to be able to send BTC via an onion website to the wallet.

would this be the correct conf
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
rpcuser=---
rpcpassword=---
rpcport-the port i enabled
rpcconnect=127.0.0.1

Those are the settings used, and the coins I sent have been sitting in limbo for over an hour with no confirmations, the blockchain is fully downloaded.

Do I need to change the proxy and connect to the whonix interal i.p? Would I also need to enable the port I selected as incoming on the host machine or would it not matter as Whonix is inside a vm?</description>

<p>You absolutely should keep your wallet on your own private machine. Hosting it on the VPS means your provider can rob you blind. Hosting it on the same machine as your HS exposes you to your provider AND every attacker on the onion web. There is no advantage in keeping your coins there. Posting your bitcoin address on your website should do.</p>
<p>If you don’t feel like hosting a full node on your machine, use a light-weight wallet like Electrum that doesn’t depend on the server being honest.</p>

<p>A question of anonymity (to add risk by running a hidden service) vs…<br>
Bitcoin security (does it increase security by allowing incoming Tor<br>
hidden service). The latter I don’t know. So it <em>might</em> be a matter of<br>
priorities.</p>

            <p>Hi sorry for the late reply I’ve been busy and finally got back around to playing around with my setup, I had missed a simple thing from my Workstation bitcoin.conf file which was blocking what I was attemtping to do and it started working once I changed the .conf.</p>
<p>However I am glad that I indeed made this post because of the information you posted in regards to</p>
<p>listen=0<br>
listenonion=0<br>
discover=0</p>
<p>If I use these on my hidden service will others still be able to deposit coins? Obviously i would like the service to be as safe and secure as possible even though it’s not an illegal hidden service, it’s still a hidden service.</p>
<p>One final question for yourself or Patrick, I’m asking in here as to not create a new topic but can I run a bitcoin server on one workstation and then on another workstation have the actually website and have them communicate instead of running them both from the same server like i am now</p>

<p>You cannot open ports in the classical sense of unsolicited incoming connections as this would screw up anonymity</p>
<p>[Last time I checked bitcoin-qt allowed unsolicited incoming connections by using Tor hidden services, which is cool that they thought of this, but it is totally optional and not your problem for now.[</p>

<p>This could be a non-Whonix / non-Tor related bitcoin issue. I am not up to date on this topic, but search engines find quite a lot when you search for “bitcoin confirmation slow”.</p>

<p>Not sure, too many variables. Maybe add back the last two lines in the conf, restart bitcoind, and then see if it works.</p>

            <p>Here is the relevant doc page: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Money" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Money</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what your host OS is. Mine is Qubes 3.1. To find out the ip/port for the <code>bitcoin.conf</code> you need to check on your gateway for proper stream isolation. On my system I can find that out by running this in a terminal on the gateway:</p>
<pre><code>cat /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc | grep BitCoin -A 4 | tail -n 1
</code></pre>
<p>I would also suggest adding the following to your <code>bitcoin.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>proxyrandomize=1
</code></pre>
<p>Also you must decide if you want to relay transactions and allow SPV lookups or not. If you do not want those extra connections, then you need to add these lines as well:</p>
<pre><code>listen=0
listenonion=0
discover=0
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, you do not need these lines (localhost is allowed RPC connection without the need, these are in case you want to connect remotely or if you change the port to something non default):</p>
<pre><code>rpcport-the port i enabled
rpcconnect=127.0.0.1</code></pre>
