    <description>Maybe this has been already said somewhere, but what’s the recommended way to upgrade ? Are the dist-upgrade good enough? Or is it better to just transfer the files that has been modified manually and begin from scratch again and replace those files ?</description>

            <p>it would probably be easier and less bandwidth heavy to download the new whonix ova/tar files and import your custom files. here’s a quick means of doing that.</p>
<ol>
<li>add a new virtual hd to your old whonix instances.</li>
<li>copy the custom files that you need to the new virtual hd.</li>
<li>download the new whonix tar/ova files.</li>
<li>install the new whonix images.</li>
<li>attach the virtual hds to which you copied your cutom files to the new installed whonix instances.</li>
<li>copy your files over as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>you’ll have a less bloated whonix install, less risk of various upgrade issues, and won’t have to go through multiple lengthy download procedures with the dist-upgrade instructions. just confirm that you’ve successfully copied all of the custom files you need to the new whonix installations before you delete your old images.</p>
