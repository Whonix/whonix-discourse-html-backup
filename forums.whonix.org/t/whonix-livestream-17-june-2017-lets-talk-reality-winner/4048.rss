    <description>&lt;small&gt;Originally published at:			https://www.whonix.org/blog/whonix-livestream-17-june-2017-lets-talk-reality-winner
		&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve just wrapped up the third monthly Patreon Live Stream.

This time I covered the Reality Winner leaks, what kind of mistakes were done by the Intercept as well as her and why these leaks are going to have a hard time impacting a lot of people.

I&#39;d like to note on that front that on two occasions during this stream, I made the mistake of stating Jeff Sessions occupation wrongly. This was a mistake on my part which does in no way change anything stated surrounding Sessions actions, though I still would like to apologize for making this mistake. Also, I&#39;m starting to realize that I should attempt to suppress those &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenGrammarError&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Um&#39;s&lt;span class=&quot;hiddenGrammarError&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; as they are beginning to be really annoying...

You may watch it now here: https://youtu.be/pb_BHUr00kg

<p>Sadly with the current method that wouldn’t be possible. We (or rather in this case I) are streaming live via OBS. Sadly normalization isn’t really something doable “on-the-fly”. Will though for the future look at ways to improve the audio set-up in general.</p>

<p>Thanks for the recommendation. I actually already (believe it or not) have a rather solid background when it comes to rethoric, public speaking and hosting presentations. However, I “hold speeches” predominently in German and in general, while I do write a lot in English on a regular basis, I rarely get to use it when talking to other people. That’s as far as I can tell the crux of the issue, I talk so rarely in English that I consistently need to search for required phrases.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>

<p>Is that a hidden youtube video?  I told a friend to check out your video, by name, but even typed EXACTLY with all punctuation, youtube returned only other junk, not your video.</p>

<p>Please NORMALIZE your audio.  :-p</p>
