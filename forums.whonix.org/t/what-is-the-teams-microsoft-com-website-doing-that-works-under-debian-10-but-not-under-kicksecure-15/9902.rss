    <description>In short: all else being equal microsoft teams website let&#39;s me login under debian-10 or windows-7 but not under kicksecure-15. I am curious and want to find out why. Can you give me a strategy how to investigate?

In detail:

* I have a qubes VM work-web that runs using my debian-10 template with the brave-browser (all works fine here)
* Next I cloned the debian-10 template to kicksecure-15 and installed kicksecure. Then I switched all my qubes VMs that previously ran under debian-10 to kicksecure-15. All work exactly as before except work-web.
* I can no longer log into the teams website with Duo authentication if work-web uses the kicksecure-15 template. If I switch back to debian-10 it works. Back to kicksecure-15 it doesn&#39;t.
* I have not modified the templates in any other way other than the clone &amp; install kicksecure-cli

I suspect kicksecure-15 is doing exactly what it is supposed to do and somehow the teams login process extracts some system detail during the login process. I&#39;d like to find out what that is. Any ideas?</description>

            <p>In the end it turned out to be a time issue. Calling sudo qvm-sync-clock<br>
fixes it. Took me a while to figure it out.</p>

<p>I tested once more to be sure and installed Chromium and Firefox-ESR in<br>
both the debian-10 template and the kicksecure-15 template (the later<br>
one was previously cloned from debian-10 and then kicksecure-cli was<br>
installed).</p>
<p>All of them (brave, chromium &amp; firefox) work when the debian-10 template is used and all of them see the endless login loop when kicksecure-15 is used.</p>
