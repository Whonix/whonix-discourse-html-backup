    <title>How to transfer from a Whonix vdi backup into a Whonix Qubes VM?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-transfer-from-a-whonix-vdi-backup-into-a-whonix-qubes-vm/2551</link>
    <description>On my list of things to do to get my new Qubes setup, er uhm setup is to get all the information I had on my old Whonix setup (using virtual box) and have a vdi backup of. As I understand it Qubes doesn&#39;t play well with virtualization software and I prefer not to goop up my clean installation with a one off install of virtbox just to get my old whonix files (though I guess I could install it on a disposibleVM? assuming virtbox can be installed in qubes).

Ideas or perhaps there is a howto out there (didn&#39;t see one when I looked but won&#39;t dismiss the possiblity of my perhaps having overlooked it?).

Thanks in advance!</description>

<p>one can write files to an iso. If I am understanding that right wouldn’t that be something I could then extract the contents from in a WhonixVM in Qubes?</p>

<p>Yes, but you don’t currently have access to your files because you don’t have a virtualbox installation right?</p>

<p>If you’re just looking to recover data, then it should be fairly straightforward. Check this thread: <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/qubes-users/54s9-OtQ_Ks/7smKMyeeJwAJ">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/qubes-users/54s9-OtQ_Ks/7smKMyeeJwAJ</a></p>
<p>(not tested by me) you can use qemu-img to convert your .vdi into a .raw and mount that in a qubesvm to get your data. (Keep in mind that you might need to allocate <strong>a lot</strong> of private storage to your vm.) Follow-up questions should go to qubes-users mailing list.</p>

            <p>I was looking around some more and came across the File Transfer page (a bit humbling considered I had looked before already) at <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer</a> and it mentions, if I understand correctly, that one can write files to an iso. If I am understanding that right wouldn’t that be something I could then extract the contents from in a WhonixVM in Qubes?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. While there are certainly some things I can redo (some rc files etc, a bit of a PITA though) there are somethings that can’t just be redone, I have my keepass database and some important text files so I’d really like to get them out.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>While there are ways of converting .vdi images to xen images (the hypervisor isued in Qubes), as explained <a href="https://www.serverstack.com/blog/2012/11/20/converting-virtualbox-vm-to-a-xen-hypervisor-virtual-machine/">here</a>, as far as I can tell they won’t work with Qubes-Whonix, as it is different to VBox-Whonix in a number of ways. Reinstalling everything is your safest bet as far as this goes.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
