    <title>Another TorBrowser noscript/javascript issue</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/another-torbrowser-noscript-javascript-issue/8530</link>
    <description>Hi, after a fresh install of whonix-ws-15 and Tor Browser 9.0.1 via Tor Browser Downloader in the template I also have issues with noscript.

I got the security slider notification upon first run and I set the slider to standard. And when the tor browser is running the shield icon is white (as it should be). But javascript is somehow blocked.

What can I do about this?

I think it has something to do with the tor browser version. Because I also get this problem if I update to 9.0.1 in whonix-ws-14.

Right now the only option for me is to run version 9.0 in whonix-ws-14. Then everything functions as it should.</description>
