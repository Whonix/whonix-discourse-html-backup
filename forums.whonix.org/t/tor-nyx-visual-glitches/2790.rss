    <title>Tor NYX visual glitches</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-nyx-visual-glitches/2790</link>
    <description>Good day.

I am hoping someone could shed some light on this. I use Qubes-Whonix and usually keep NYX (ARM) opened. Graphical glitches are rare and at times it needs to be restarted due to them. However I find it quite peculiar that twice now, the visual glitches were of a whole different kind, namely, in the first case it asked me to press &#39;c&#39; to confirm if I wish to purge the logs and the second time it asked me to press &#39;x&#39; to confirm resetting Tor&#39;s internal state. Resizing the terminal window in the second case brought the terminal back to normal. 

Something tells me this is nothing to be worried about although I am curious why it does this. Anyone experiences such glitches as well? Should I update the graphics drivers?</description>

<p>Right. See:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Am_I_compromised.3F">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Am_I_compromised.3F</a></p>
<p>Arm has many issues, see:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller#Arm_FAQ">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Controller#Arm_FAQ</a></p>
<p>I would not worry. If you want this fixed, please check the arm issue tracker and take this up to the developer of arm should this be necessary.</p>

            <p>I’ve had this happen frequently on a Physical-Isolation-build Gateway and somewhat rarely on a Qubes-Whonix Gateway. IIRC it’s never happened on a Virtualbox Gateway. No idea what’s happening… Just waiting for Nyx release.</p>
