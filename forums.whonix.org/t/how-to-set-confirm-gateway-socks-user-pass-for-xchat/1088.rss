    <description>Using Whonix 10 Workstation, I figured I would hop in Whonix IRC channel, but I am unable to connect.  This is the connection message:
[code]
* Looking up irc.oftc.net
* Looking up 10.137.3.1
* Connecting to 10.137.3.1 (10.137.3.1) port 9101...
 No channel joined. Try /join #&lt;channel&gt;
* Connection failed. Error: SSL handshake timed out
* Looking up irc.oftc.net
* Looking up 10.137.3.1
* Connecting to 10.137.3.1 (10.137.3.1) port 9101...
* Connection failed. Error: SSL handshake timed out
[/code]

10.137.3.1 IP address is the gateway IP address and I can telnet to that IP address at port 9101 so it is reachable.  XChat setting for proxy contain an option for username and password which have been preset to &#39;XChat&#39;.

Could the problem here be that the &#39;XChat&#39; user name and password are not set on the gateway?</description>

            <p>[quote=“Patrick, post:2, topic:1088”]The socks username is useful for stream isolation. Otherwise ignored. And very unlikely to cause any issues. That’s a super simple Tor feature. IsolateSOCKSAuth</p>
<p>More likely the irc network did not accept connections from the Tor network [from that exit] at that time. Happens every now and then to me. Changing Tor circuit might help. Another irc network might work fine. (Not freenode, that’s specifically difficult to connect to using Tor.)[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay, thanks for the explanation; no wonder I could not find the setting <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I was just trying to connect to your IRC channel.  I may try later.</p>
