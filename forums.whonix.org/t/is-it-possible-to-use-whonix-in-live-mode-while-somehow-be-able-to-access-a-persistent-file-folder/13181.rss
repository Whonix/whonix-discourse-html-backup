    <description>Hey there, 

I am somewhat unsure that this is the right category, but the others doesn&#39;t seem to be fitting too.

If somebody would use Virtualbox Whonix Workstation in Live-Mode and still would like to be able to take notes or save a screenshot. How could that be accomplished? Something like the Tails Persistent Storage option would be awesome... 

I was thinking about attaching a USB with passthrough to access a location, but that seems not recommended. Another idea was to use an online tool/cloud storage (which could be accessed through the browser) but that brings up other security disadvantages. Would love to hear your ideas or approaches.

This is specifically asked for non-Qubes-Whonix.</description>

            <p>it can be done. i’ve added an additional virtual hard drive. then, for the folders that i want to be able to maintain persistent storage, i move those folders to the additional virtual drive and add a symbolic link to them on the original virtual drive that will be run in live mode.</p>

            <p>We don’t have that documented. Help welcome!</p>
<p>Approaches where it seems to be these would have good success chances:</p>
<p>A) Add a separate hard drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>“forget” about live mode for a while</li>
<li>Debian in a VM (not Whonix for simplicity)</li>
<li>figure out how to add a second virtual hard drive and how to use it</li>
<li>do the same with Whonix persistent</li>
<li>do the same with Whonix Live</li>
</ol>
<p>In that order for the sake of:</p>

<p>B) re-mount read-write</p>
<p>As long as the drive isn’t set to read-only mode and as long as you have sudo access, in theory you should be able to re-mount a specific folder with read/write.</p>
