    <title>splitting Whonix documentation into a short and long edition for better usability</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/splitting-whonix-documentation-into-a-short-and-long-edition-for-better-usability/1861</link>
    <description>At 32c3 I got some feedback, that even very advanced Linux users and developers give up on Whonix even before getting started because they don&#39;t know what it does and/or because it looks so complicated. Too much verbosity / documentation to get started.

I concluded with @troubadour, that the current https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation page should be split into two. A short and a long edition. The short edition as minimal as possible. The long edition, with everything.

Perhaps:

* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation_Short_Edition
* https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation_Extended_Edition

Better page names can be suggested.

The current https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation page would become the long edition. The short edition would mention and link to the long edition with an explanatory text such as &quot;if you would like to learn more / become more secure / etc. / missing something / see the documentation long edition&quot;. Perhaps the long edition should include everything the short edition includes.

Please suggest what should absolute [not] go into the short edition.</description>

            <p>Hi Patrick (and everyone else),</p>
<p>I think the headings and sub-headings are fine for now, if we want to imitate a ‘Tor Browser’ manual style short guide. Sweet and simple (the KISS principle).</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/entr0py">@entr0py</a> progresses, it will become clear whether anything else is needed. I think the Qubes-Whonix vs Whonix separation I originally did may or may not need to be imitated, even in a short version.</p>
<p>I’m happy to edit this as entr0py nuts it out. I also agree this thread is far too long. So, I’ve started a new thread for the short version where only entries and suggested edits should happen. I’ve cut and pasted entr0py’s suggested ToC.</p>
<p>If we get our shit together, this might even get done for Christmas! <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>The advantage of going this route is, as I’ve previously explained, that users get gradually thought everything neceassary to operate Whonix, rather than in one session, making the whole “ordeal” easier to digest. Arguments against it have been that this approach isn’t really of use considering users likely click" through the whole thing in one go eitherway since they want to use Whonix to its fullest immediately. Adding to that, finding what you are looking for might be harder than with an “one-page-solution”. However, I personally feel that a chapter based approach makes a project look better, though that is likely just me.</p>

<p>The advantage of going this route is, as I’ve previously explained, that users get gradually thought everything neceassary to operate Whonix, rather than in one session, making the whole “ordeal” easier to digest. Arguments against it have been that this approach isn’t really of use considering users likely click" through the whole thing in one go eitherway since they want to use Whonix to its fullest immediately. Adding to that, finding what you are looking for might be harder than with an “one-page-solution”. However, I personally feel that a chapter based approach makes a project look better, though that is likely just me.</p>

<p>The advantages of a “one-page-concept” with click- and linkable subcategories is rather obvious. It’s easier to maintain, let’s users find information more quickly and efficiently and all in all is very similar to what we currently have on MediaWiki on sites like “DoNot”. Different to those however, to save screenspace, it was (at least at the time) decided against having the chapters on top or the site of the page. This might make finding your way arround as a newcomer harder. However, since newcomers should be reading the entire thing anyways, this shouldn’t be a deal breaker. Having one long, ongoing page also means that we should try to keep the information as focused, short and simple as is humanly possible, otherwise we (as I’ve mentioned in detail before) may overwhelm users with so much information that they wouldn’t want to use Whonix in the first place or (even worse) underwhelm them so much that they immediately presume all that information isn’t necessary and is already something they know. Both states we should avoid, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Ah, I see. Well, I can see why you see these things as issues, though let me clarify a bit which engines are problematic with such a set-up. The more severe issues, like messing up the base layout or collapsing at any click regardless of where it is made, should only be expected to happen on browsers like the Internet Explorer 8, due to its rather obscure implementation of CSS.</p>
<p>The persitence issue is however one which indeed happens regardless of browser, as shown in these small examples: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/19170853">http://stackoverflow.com/a/19170853</a> As you can see, most of the shown examples are plagued with this problem. The top one seems to work on Blink at least without fault. Adding to that, there seem to be other, more advanced approaches which, at least from what I can tell, seem to work much more reliable like this one: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/thurstanh/emtAm/2/">http://jsfiddle.net/thurstanh/emtAm/2/</a></p>

<p>Yes, would be possible easily as well, though this approach suffers from the “persitence issues”, whereas the last example I linked doesn’t making it a much better choice as a base.</p>

</aside>
<p>I feel like regarding that, it would be necessary to really come to an agreement in regards to certain aspects. After all, most requirements we agreed on previously in that or other threads have already been achived in one way or another.</p>
<p>Let’s go through them one by one:</p>

<p>Can we make it pretty? Usable, modern presentation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the “New Website Thread”, I have already demonstrated and discussed a few designs. Whether these are presentable enough however, would have to be decided, as well as the question, which of the many mock-ups/attempts now should be used (i.e. categories on the side, long page, etc).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we have a mostly imported migration process from the old to the new wiki?<br>
What about internal links?<br>
What about wiki templates?<br>
What about special markup such as {{Code2|…}} etc?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since this is mainly being discussed for the short documentation, this question isn’t really important for this discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we add meta tags (for seo, social media)? (Example below.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different ways to achieve this with Jekyll, however I didn’t really test any at the current point in time.</p>

<p>Should the Quick-Start guide be a table of contents that,</p>
<ul>
<li>a) a table of contents that, links to all content</li>
<li>b) all Quick-Start guide content one one page?</li>

<p>I guess a) is better.</p>
<p>Where to add the Quick-Start guide?</p>

<li>a) mediawiki</li>
<li>b) new Whonix homepage “<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/EgoBits1.github.io">EgoBits1</a>”</li>
</ul>
<p>a) is easy. Could be done very soon.</p>
<p>b) might require concluding the <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/mediawiki-replacement">mediawiki replacement</a> thread first.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Porting/Incorporating any documentation once done shouldn’t be an issue, seing how most of the “Quick-Start-Documentation-Base-Code” seems to be working fine at the current moment from my point of view.</p>

<p>Is possible thanks to CSS, though strange. What I mean by that is that, from what I can tell (and read on Stack Overflow, etc) all more or less known CSS based “Expandable Text solutions” either don’t work with certain renderers, mess up the apperance of the rest of the site or at the very least aren’t persistent with one another, meaning that due to the nature of CSS (or rather the input feature “abused” for this), once you open one and then open another one, the first one will be closed regardless of the fact the user actually didn’t close it. On some renderers, this “persistence issue” seems to go so far as to once a user clicks anywhere on the site, the “expanded text field” closed.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind however, that all of this isn’t really that big of an issue compared to the alternative of never giving additional information, if the user desires it, during the initial introduction/learning fase, I feel compelled to say this as a reason for not using such a solution.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>

<p>Right. This <em>thread</em> needs to be split into a short and long edition… <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Please disregard <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/splitting-whonix-documentation-into-a-short-and-long-edition-for-better-usability/1861/10">splitting Whonix documentation into a short and long edition for better usability</a>. That was a draft for the Quick-Start guide which I realized was way too long.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong> is to have 2 things when all is done.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The existing documentation stays in its current form. It could use a general editing pass to remove obsolete information, merge duplicated info, etc. It should also be re-categorized into meaningful categories (instead of having half the entries in “Advanced Topics”). <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/splitting-whonix-documentation-into-a-short-and-long-edition-for-better-usability/1861/16">Proposed categories.</a></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/torjunkie">@torjunkie</a>’s <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-quick-start-guide-v0-1/2828">guide</a> falls into a category of its own. The issue with a document that is that comprehensive is that it becomes difficult to maintain over time because you forget what’s in it. Hence, keeping it disaggregated like the current wiki makes more sense IMO. However, it seems like it would be a waste not to offer it somewhere…</p>
<p>Since <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/torjunkie">@torjunkie</a> <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/new-qubes-website-new-whonix-website/1736/150?u=entr0py">is busy at the moment</a>, I will take pieces of his guide and put together a Quick-Start draft. Hopefully, he’ll have time to review it with his excellent writing skills! Also, I don’t know how to make web pages, so once the content is finished, perhaps <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/ego">@Ego</a> can port it to the web platform.</p>
<p>EDIT: Speaking of the web platform, does the current engine allow for collapsible text without javascript? It’d be nice to direct readers to additional links for further information, but only if they can be hidden behind a click.</p>

<p>Too many terms. Quick start, entire documentation, full documentation.</p>

<p>What you just quoted was for the Quick-Start guide. On second thought, I think Section 1:</p>

<ol>
<li>An Introduction to Whonix<br>
a. What is Whonix<br>
b. How is Whonix different from other Anonymity Distributions</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>shouldn’t be included in the Quick-Start. There should be a link “What is Whonix?” on the main page and there should be a separate page dedicated to explaining what Whonix is; an overview of how it works; and a comparison to other systems.</p>
<p>So Quick-Start should jump straight to choosing, downloading, installing, and running. I’m thinking the target audience should be Windows/Mac/very new Linux users with little to no experience with Tor and little to no experience with VMs. So the goal is: accessibility, accessibility, accessibility. (also favor GUI over CLI wherever possible) Start with basic security/privacy and give them the path to advance further if inclined. I’ll try to write some prose this weekend.</p>
