    <title>Which one of the following phones provide better security/anonymity?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/which-one-of-the-following-phones-provide-better-security-anonymity/1549</link>
    <description>im searching for new phone that considered to be the highest respected phone for the privacy and security (i know there is no 100% but at least the highest one).

so i am confused between two phones atm; which they:-

1- Jolla phone with Sailfish OS 

link:- https://sailfishos.org/

2- Blackphone with Silent OS 

link:- https://www.silentcircle.com/

is anyone using one of these products or has a good knowledge about these phones ? if yes , can he review these products ?

useful detailed comparison links also useful.</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>well, BBs current primary goal is to offer the, in their eyes, best solutions for big companyâ€™s and governments, which is why they also keep a focus on security. Many (actually pretty much all) the security features, included in Silent OS, were in BB 10 a long time ago, except for maybe their encrypted VOIP, but for that, your partner needs a Blackphone or at least the necessary software plus fees, which also seems to run on BB.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>the Blackberry smart phones are by far the best, when it comes to security. Currently, I have three BBs in my household and thus know all the features these phones boast in areas like encryption, which go far beyond what other phones offer. I can especially recommend the Z10, as it is both durable and fast, but also unbelievably cheap at the time.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
