    <description>I have been doing a lot of reading on Whonix. I must say it sound quite nice. But I was trying to get a vague idea of whonix&#39;s userbase size and could not find any info. The Tails devs put out download numbers in their monthly reports. Is there anything like this for whonix?</description>

            <p>[quote=“Patrick, post:3, topic:497”]If we had download statistics, we had download numbers, we still wouldn’t know how many users we got. Had some clue if Whonix is getting more popular, though.</p>
<p>There are some more data points. But nothing conclusively. However, for your curiosity I just now updated this wiki page:<br>

            <p>We don’t have anything like that, but I agree it would be interesting to get some statistics.</p>
<p>However, it is difficult to have statistics without being overly invasive. It is made doubly difficult because our downloads are served by mirrors provided by volunteers. I suppose we could have a simple counting script in front of those download links. Nothing as of yet, but I’ll look into an easy / non-invasive way to get some basic statistics.</p>
