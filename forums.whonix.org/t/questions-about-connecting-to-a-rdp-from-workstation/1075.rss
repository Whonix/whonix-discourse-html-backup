    <title>Questions about connecting to a RDP from workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/questions-about-connecting-to-a-rdp-from-workstation/1075</link>
    <description>When I connect to a RDP in my whonix workstation, all traffics from my workstation are torified  through gateway before hitting to the RDP, correct?

The IPs that the RDP keep logs will be the tor exit nodes since all traffics going out of the workstation are torified, correct?

Is there a obvious way that the RDP provider can trace back to my real identity/IP?

Is it better for me to add a VPN on my host or in the workstation? thanks to everyone here for answering my concerns.</description>
