    <title>can&#39;t start whonix workstation due to sdwdate failure</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/cant-start-whonix-workstation-due-to-sdwdate-failure/10886</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am hoping someone can help here. The other day I updated/upgraded my Gateway and when I attempted to start the Workstation it just glitched out and would not start. It was trying to start over and over but I could see the error:

&quot;Failed to start Secure Distributed Web Date&quot;

I booted into recovery mode and tried restarting sdwdate service to no avail. It continued referencing a &quot;fatal error that resulted in a code dump&quot;.

sdwdate on the Gateway appears to be functioning fine.

What else can I try?

Thank you,

            <p>gw - Whonix-Gateway<br>
ws - Whonix-Workstation</p>
<p>Needs to be debugged. Daemon log required.<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#Daemon_Log">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#Daemon_Log</a></p>
<p>Can’t boot ws, cannot boot anymore at all? Cannot start any terminal emulator in ws anymore? In this case, sdwdate failing would probably be just a symptom. Something else that is broken. sdwdate doesn’t have the power to prevent boot.</p>
<p>Prerequisite knowledge: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles">Virtual Consoles</a><br>
Try to login in a virtual console in a functional VM (gw or ws). Does that work?<br>
If yes, try login to virtual console in the broken ws. Does that work?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Recovery#Recovery_Mode">Recovery Mode</a>? That won’t help unless you know any commands to run there to fix something. Users are not supposed to start sdwdate there.</p>
<p>If you cannot get a terminal emulator and no virtual console in the broken ws, then we need to acquire daemon log / whole systemd journal log from recovery mode. I will document how to do that soonish.</p>
