            <p>Hello guys;<br>
The Virtualbox issue comes up around here from time to time. I have had exactly the same issues at one time or another with the screen size. Through some experimentation and a deep dive into Virtualbox, these are some common ways to mitigate the screen issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>have a recent kernel. Whonix takes care of this so just make sure to have a fully updated Whonix system.</li>
<li>Don’t fiddle with the guest additions. It comes already installed in Whonix. If you have a guest additions iso on your host, do not use it.</li>
<li>Graphics. Always try to use VMSVGA. This is the ‘recommended’ choice from virtualbox. The others are really there for systems that cannot accomodate vmsvga.</li>
<li>Ram. Have enough allocated to your workstation. 2gb or more works well.</li>
<li>On your host, please make sure that the version of Virtualbox running is not too far away from the version of the Whonix guest additions. In other words, if guest additions are 6.1.x, do not have your host use 6.0.x.</li>
<li>Keep your host’s Virtualbox up to date. Sometimes small changes are pushed and if you do not update, it will cause a conflict.</li>
</ol>
<p>For reference, here is what i am running:<br>
Debian Buster Host. kernel 4.19.0-10<br>
Virtualbox version 6.1.12 (from oracle website)<br>
Host graphics are intel. Virtualbox graphics is VMSVGA.<br>
(Sometimes, when the screen would not size correctly in past versions, I would restart the virtual machine and re-size to fullscreen early before it finishes booting. This seemed to fix the issue)<br>
With the current Virtualbox listed above and all the specs and also with a full updated Whonix, I have no problems with screen. (1920x1080 by the way)</p>

<p>That’s expected. That’s not how you can start an terminal application.</p>
<p>Simplified: You need to open a terminal emulator. See:<br>

            <p>Thank you for your workaround.  With it, I was able to display my workstation in 1920x1080 now.  Full screen and Scaled Mode work as expected now.  However, I am still unable to run the “Display” app within Whonix workstation.  When I click on it, it just flashes very quickly and disappears (crashes)?  Because I am able to display the desired resolution already, I don’t have a need to run the “Display” app anymore.  But in the future, I am sure I will need it.  Anyone knows the cause of the crash of the “Display” app?  Thanks.  The versions of my software are listed below.</p>
<p>Virtual Box Version 6.1.12 r139181 (Qt5.6.2) running on Windows 10 Version 10.0.19041.388.<br>
Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster), XFCE 4.12 (all came preinstalled with the whonix distribution I downloaded from whonix website today 8/2/2020).</p>

            <p>I’ve tested even with virtual box software inside whonix repo, guest additions included in new upgrade are not working out of box for window resize (full screen) , Guest screen auto adjust , and xfce display setting crash , also with vm view menu we cant resize guest to any screen resolution</p>
<p>So concultion IMO is that problem is in guest additions (6.1.6)   … so either upgrade guest additions or downgrade guest additions will solve all these problems</p>

            <p>Only one workaround yet i discover</p>
<p>In VirtualBox prefrence (not VM settings) set display to hint and add resultion 1920x1080</p>
<p>Boot workstation and it would work perfect in full screen mode (ctrl+f)<br>
But guest auto resize wont work when u close full screen in maximise or any window positiin there would be scroll bar …</p>

            <p>Alright<br>
And i am sure am not alone with these kind of bugs<br>
Something break these things in new release  … i will also test by downgrading guest_dkms to older version<br>
Because newly import images also have same behavior and same happed with VMs i upgraded by APT …<br>
Will report you back if i find something intersting</p>

<p>Meanwhile try <code>xrandr</code> (which is a bit difficult to use). Or try <code>lxrandr</code></p>

<p>sudo apt install lxrandr</p>

<p>Maybe it wouldn’t happen with a lower resolution. Not suggesting this as a permanet fix but for debugging purposes.</p>
