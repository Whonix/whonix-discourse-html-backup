    <title>Lantern - Alternative Censorship Circumvention Tool - Warning</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/lantern-alternative-censorship-circumvention-tool-warning/7763</link>
    <description>I stumbled upon the wiki entry for [Lantern](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Lantern) and did some digging. The wiki recommends it as a censorship circumvention tool but there should be a huge warning for using Lantern. This is so dodgy.

There is no documentation at all. The only stuff I could find is them saying it unblocks websites which doesn&#39;t document how at all. They link to a [Developer FAQ](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/%5Bdevelopers%5D-Questions-and-Answers) which is empty. There is an [old version](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/%5Bdevelopers%5D-Questions-and-Answers/494ad54bd91d4d17ed1c9c497ab9857e180b7a2a) but the commits say this is extremely outdated.

They say they are based in Los Angeles but their [Github repos](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/getlantern) and [Terms of Service](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern/Lantern-TOS.pdf) have *lots* of chinese text.

Their github repo has thousands of stars and forks (even though it seems to be a small project) from what seems to be bot accounts as a lot have no activity whatsoever.

Their github account has hundreds of repos completely irrelevant to lantern.

Their [privacy policy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lantern/LanternPrivacyPolicy.pdf) basically admits it is spyware. They log your IP, websites you visit, device IDs, files you have on your computer and much more.

They also link to a forum which doesn&#39;t even exist.</description>

            <p>Apologise if this is too out of hand for this topic but I am faintly aware of Lantern. Could perhaps read more some-day and respond with better questions. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Understood if you do not want to discuss specifics but how well does it work as a transport behind GFW as of recent?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>So, let’s break this down. First off, I work on Lantern. You think that because Lantern’s web sites have lots of Chinese text, that means its dodgy right? Quick question: what’s the biggest censoring country in the world? Which country is the most sophisticated at censoring? The answer to both questions is China. People in China speak Chinese. If you see a “censorship circumvention” tool that does not have lots of Chinese text that means either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s not big enough to have reached China – aka its likely irrelevant</li>
<li>It doesn’t work in China</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are common and quite likely. TLDR, a censorship circumvention tool having lots of Chinese text should be a prerequisite for you thinking that it might actually work.</p>

<p>You must be getting that from this section of the privacy policy that says the exact opposite:</p>
<p>“We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your<br>
outgoing Lantern server IP address associated with the connection timestamp, or session<br>
duration.”</p>

Lantern is a free and open-source peer-to-peer internet censorship circumvention tool, used for casual web browsing. It provides a way to bypass state-sanctioned filtration through a network of trusted users, but it's not an anonymity tool like Tor. Using Lantern, users in countries having free internet access can share their bandwidth with those who are in countries where the network is partly blocked. Network connections will be dispersed between multiple computers running Lantern so  Lantern'...</p>
