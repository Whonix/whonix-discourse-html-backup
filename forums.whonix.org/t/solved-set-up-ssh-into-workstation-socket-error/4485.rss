    <title>SOLVED: Set up SSH into Workstation - Socket error</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-set-up-ssh-into-workstation-socket-error/4485</link>
    <description>Using a headless setup, I am trying to SSH into the Workstation (SSH &gt; Host &gt; SSH &gt; Gateway &gt; SSH &gt; Workstation - per https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway). 

The connection from Host to Gateway has been successfully created. Now trying to set up the connection from the Gateway to the Workstation. I am stumped as to why I am getting the following error:

user@host:~$ /usr/bin/ssh.anondist-orig user@10.152.152.11
Read from socket failed: Connection reset by peer

I have tried researching, but am unable to find any useful direction. 

Can anyone assist?

EDIT: Figured out the issue. I had to rebuild the ssh keys on the workstation and reinstall openssh server/client.</description>
