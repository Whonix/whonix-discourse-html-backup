    <title>[Done] support link / community link / new General forum category / redirections</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/done-support-link-community-link-new-general-forum-category-redirections/224</link>
    <description>On the main page (https://www.whonix.org) I replaced the &quot;support&quot; link (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support) with &quot;community&quot; which links to https://www.whonix.org/forum.

To substitute the support wiki page (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support) I created a new General forum category above the Whonix forum category.

Good or bad idea?

I am also thinking if we still require redirections to other support places. At some point Whonix community might be big enough to also answer general Linux support questions. But what if a question can not be answered, advice to ask on stackexchange?</description>

<p>Occq, so in summary you do agree with killing the support the home page and linking to forum with a link called community?</p>

</aside>
<p>I would keep both Community and Support (it has good content that quickly explains how Whonix support works. Going on the forum takes a bit more figuring out and more categories make the forum cluttered) tabs however I would rename Community to Forum.</p>

This is not something I can answer out of the top of my head, I can figure out where it's explained or how to fix it myself in some minutes, but a specialized community will be able to answer this with a lot less effort. So having a template (for manual copy and paste) such as "if this answer is too incomplete and no one else can complete it, try asking on stackexchange adding the whonix tag" would be useful.</blockquote>
<p>I agreed about the template.</p>
<blockquote>[quote]"Whonix Bug Reports / Feature Requests"

<p>Yeah, bug tracker is really non-ideal. Communities are disconnected. Github has a hyperactive developer community. For example in the Bitcoin repository, loads of issues being discussed, loads of pull requests. For now, we get better feedback when discussing stuff in the forum. But in the forum discussions get lost (fall down) since there is no status (as in [open] [solved] [free to take it] [not a bug] etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub is more devs, forum more regular people IMO. While non-ideal, the solution to push good threads from forum to github seems OK for now.</p>
<p>Edit by Patrick:<br>
Fixed quote tags.</p>

True.

Won't be necessary, when the whole category is removed?  :)
