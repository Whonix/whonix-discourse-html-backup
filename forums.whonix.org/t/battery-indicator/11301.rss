    <title>Battery indicator?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/battery-indicator/11301</link>
    <description>Does Whonix come with one? I tried looking for it but I couldn&#39;t find anything. The reason is that I make Whonix full screen and its kind of annoying to always have to exit full screen to see battery levels. If not, is this done for security reasons?</description>
