    <description>(Continuation of https://forums.whonix.org/t/moderator-rights-staff-promotion.)

Is there any existing Whonix staff that lacks and privileges?

Any existing Whonix supporters that could use a promotion?

Please feel free to suggest anything here. I don&#39;t think we have a 
existing guidelines for this process, perhaps that&#39;s a good thing and 
makes it more dynamic.</description>

<p>Hi Patrick and Ego,</p>
<p>Thanks for the invite! Sure, why not.</p>

<p>Your welcome!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My main interest is ongoing editing (as you have probably guessed)<br>
and I just want to contribute to Whonix since I’ve been using it for<br>
years, and free-loading off the work of the whole team.</p>
<p>Plus, I’m bored in my current situation. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Privacy is an inalienable right, so I want the documentation to be as<br>
useful and tight as possible to increase the user population, and<br>
increase the security of all Tor users (us included).</p>
<p>My main goal is to work through as much (all?) of the main<br>
documentation as I can this year (maybe excluding all the dev stuff,<br>
since that is huge) and have the Whonix bible looking really nice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t intend to do anything different than I do now i.e. edit and<br>
seek feedback on its suitability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No need to do something different. You’re doing great as is. For that<br>
reason you’re exactly the right person. Would be more red flag if<br>
someone just came here for the admin rights.</p>
<p>Forum mod will be useful so you can move a few posts whenever that is<br>
useful. And wiki admin will be useful if you want to create like new<br>
wiki pages (templates or so).</p>
<p>Do you have a wiki account yet?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe occasional blog posts if you want them. I’m not a technician<br>
like you guys, so I don’t trust myself to get all the details right<br>
on this complex project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure thing! <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Great! (Not just recognition. torjunkie could use wiki admin rights so new page creation works as well.)</p>
