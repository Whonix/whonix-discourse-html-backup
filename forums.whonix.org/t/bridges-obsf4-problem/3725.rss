    <description>I have configured bridges and restarted Tor. Everything works like a charm but when i open arm in Gateway I get a notifications ( I deleted time logs ):


[WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to //////////Deleted/////////////////////////// (&quot;server rejected connection&quot;)
[ARM_NOTICE] Unable to prepopulate bandwidth information (insufficient uptime)
[ARM_WARN] The torrc differs from what tor&#39;s using. You can issue a sighup to reload the torrc values by pressing x.
   - configuration values are missing from the torrc: HiddenServiceStatistics, RunAsDaemon
[ARM_NOTICE] Tor is preventing system utilities like netstat and lsof from working. This means that arm can&#39;t provide you with conn-
   ection information. You can change this by adding &#39;DisableDebuggerAttachment 0&#39; to your torrc and restarting tor. For more information see... https://trac.torproject.org/3313
[ARM_NOTICE] Arm is currently running with root permissions. This is not a good idea, and will still work perfectly well if it&#39;s run
   with the same user as Tor (ie, starting with &quot;sudo -u debian-tor arm&quot;).
 [ARM_NOTICE] No armrc loaded, using defaults. You can customize arm by placing a configuration file at &#39;/root/.arm/armrc&#39; (see the
   armrc.sample for its options).

And when I check my connections I see that the entry node has the same hexadecimal code as the first one of the three bridges I got from [here](https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4) and written down in /etc/tor/torrc, but different IP.

When in arm I press x to recover values from torrc I get loads of such notifications ( i deleted ip address ):
[WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to &gt;&gt;IP address&lt;&lt;:9443 (&quot;server rejected connection&quot;)
 │ 13:32:44 [NOTICE] You configured a non-loopback address &#39;&gt;&gt;IP address&lt;:9040&#39; for TransPort. This allows everybody on your local network to

 │ 13:32:44 [NOTICE] You configured a non-loopback address &#39;&gt;&gt;IP address&lt;:5300&#39; for DNSPort. This allows everybody on your local network to

And my /etc/ter/torrc file looks like this ( I deleted bidges IP and other data due to obvious reasons ):
