    <description>I finally did the update to 11. 
Thank you for the bigger resolution, much better to work now!

I also noticed that now the mouse pointer moves freely in and out of the host.
Before I had to press the host key to do that.
Is that expeted beahviour and are there any risks related to it?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>the problem which arises from this could be the accidental usage of a wrong (unsafe) browser. You may (if you’re using VBox) activate or deactivate the feature of “mouse integration” by pressing Control and I simultaneously and selecting or deselecting “Disable Mouse Integration”.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
