    <title>Gateway freezing [Partially Solved]</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/gateway-freezing-partially-solved/3032</link>
    <description>It first froze up during an update/dist-upgrade. Before freezing it hit 100% of the allocated RAM, so I upped the ram to 1000. After running for a while it froze again, so I tried 2500, and it still freezes.

I tried re-installing my host OS and the Whonix VMs, but it still happens, and only with the gateway.

I&#39;m now trying running it at 192 RAM without GUI. It&#39;s been running for 10 minutes so far without freezing, so maybe it works, but I would prefer to use a desktop environment.

Does anyone know how to fix this?

EDIT: I&#39;ve been running it at 192 RAM without GUI since I made this thread, and it has not frozen once. If anyone else is having this problem this might also fix it for you.</description>
