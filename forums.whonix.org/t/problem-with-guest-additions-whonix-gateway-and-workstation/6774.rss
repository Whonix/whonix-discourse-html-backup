    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/problem-with-guest-additions-whonix-gateway-and-workstation/6774</link>
    <description>I started with a fresh install both whonix gateway and workstation. Did sudo apt get and dist upgrade, inserted iso file and... Nothing happened. I tried doing the same on a fresh install of linux mint and a cd popped up on my desktop and started the auto run process. Searching google tried probably everything with no solution. Can someone please help me?</description>

            <p>The CLI version doesn’t scale for sure. If you could make that work, that would be superb. Haven’t seen that ever.</p>
<p>For the CLI version I even failed to even figure out how to increase the desktop resolution at all for the VirtualBox version.</p>
<p>Well, you an try getting newer VirtualBox version and/or guest addition. That <em>might</em> help. But it’s undocumented/unsupported.</p>

            <p>so i was trying to fix something that will not work <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> im okay with that, i thought that the problem with that was that i didnt have guest additions.<br>
Is there any other version that will work with scaliing etc? I see 2 versions to download, one with the XFCE and one with the non graphics, but that wont work i guess</p>
