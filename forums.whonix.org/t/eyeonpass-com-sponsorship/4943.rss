&gt;“The official sponsor of Whonix is EyeOnPASS.com - An API solution for websites and applications that prevents credential stuffing attacks on their user’s accounts.”

It would be good for Whonix users to know more information about this company, where they are from, and the type of arrangement of influence they have upon Whonix, how much and how long or often they are contributing for, and any influence on hiring of developers, writing code, suggesting features and so on.

- amount of influence: none
- non-monetary contributions: none
- hiring influence: none
- writing code: none
- suggesting features: none

EyeOnPASS.com is paying for an advertisement on whonix.org.

Should we modify that agreement, I will keep you posted.
