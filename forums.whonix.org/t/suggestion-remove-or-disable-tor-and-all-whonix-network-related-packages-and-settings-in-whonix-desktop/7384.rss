    <title>Suggestion: remove or disable Tor and all Whonix network-related packages and settings in Whonix Desktop</title>

    <description>Whonix Desktop (temporary name), based on the &quot;Hardened Debian&quot; project, and currently available for building as `whonix-host-xfce` flavor, is designed to be installed on physical hardware to act as a hardened debian host system.

As stated by @0brand  

[quote=&quot;0brand, post:9, topic:7078&quot;]
Confusing Hardened Debian for Whonix could be a distaste for someone who requires anonymity.
[/quote]

The purpose of Hardened Debian/Whonix Host is not anonymity, but security. With that in mind, it could be even dangerous for some users to have Tor and Whonix services autostart on boot. In some cases, it could lead them to prison or serious problems (thinking about particular places where Tor is forbidden or a big red flag)

If they need Tor, they have the (already installed and configured) Whonix VMs with virt-manager at  their disposal, working out of the box. 

Otherwise, we should assume that the user installing Whonix-Desktop on hardware does not want to have any Tor or other potentially suspicious networking or Whonix-related activity going on on his main machine without his explicit consent and activation.

Therefore I suggest to remove these packages from the Whonix-Desktop build, or at least disable them. 

What do you think?</description>

    Thanks for the discussion and the opportunity to confront ideas! 
Just so we can move on and progress with the project, would we agree that we have consensus on: 

not removing Whonix specific packages on the Whonix-Host install (default settings, nothing to do)
not removing Whonix specific repositories on the Whonix-Host install (default settings, nothing to do)

            <p>Still undecided.</p>
<p>madaidan via Whonix Forum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only certain network hardening options will affect the network fingerprint but many people use these anyway as they’re basic hardening. I doubt these will single out Whonix users but if Whonix does more network hardening then it might.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>subset: linux desktop users (much smaller than Windows desktop users)</li>
<li>subset: debian users (much smaller than Ubuntu desktop users)</li>
<li>subset: hardening by default (even smaller than Debian desktop users)</li>
<li>subset: in a specific country.</li>
<li>subset: in a draconian country.</li>
</ul>
<p>So when piling up so many subsets the amount of remaining users is so<br>
little that I would assume these get labeled “extremists” too.</p>
<p>Also whonix-firewall drops invalid packages. If someone wanted to probe,<br>
an active adversary could send invalid packages and then see the<br>
difference dropped vs non-dropped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be possible to have 2 builds. One for security and one for hiding Tor at all costs. Or even add this as a boot parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In theory, yes. I am happy to have this in source code, as build option,<br>
boot option, and/or whatnot. Contributions welcome. However, I wouldn’t<br>
be redistributing separate hide Tor by default builds. Lack of<br>
motivation for now. We don’t hear anything from “use of Tor is dangerous<br>
in my country” type of users, and it might be healthier to not hear more<br>
from them anyhow. It would be a big responsibility to claim we got that<br>
right and specifically attract these kind of users. There’s a line when<br>
technology cannot fix social issues.</p>

            <p>Another way to single out a Linux desktop users: At boot time they don’t<br>
have the usual Windows update and other Windows phone home traffic.</p>
<p>onion_knight via Whonix Forum:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Russia for instance has banned Tor and VPN. I don’t know whether it is<br>
enforced or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blocked or banned is also a difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know, maybe it could be, maybe not. But this is not within our control. We are powerless if using Linux is already suspicious or even dangerous. But starting Tor activities on boot is a choice we make for the user - and we can chose not to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to avoid spending significant effort on “operation<br>
succeeded, patient dead” style work. If what we produce (Linux desktop,<br>
hardened by default) already attracts attention above threshold<br>
(unwanted visitors), then not connecting to the public Tor network<br>
doesn’t make any difference in practice either.</p>

<p>By following the quoted assumption, one could argue that using Whonix host and/or using hardened debian alone would put users at risk. (They’d be using Whonix repository.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Whonix repositories are indeed a problem in this perspective. In your opinion, would it be possible to remove Whonix repositories from the the Host without breaking functionality? And if no, which ones could cause problems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly possible to remove but not possible without breaking upgrade<br>
functionality.</p>
<p>[1] Also removal of Whonix repository doesn’t help: the list of<br>
installed packages is specific to the distributor (Whonix) and leaks<br>
when using apt-get over clearnet. Any linux distribution redistributed<br>
by Whonix will be tied to the Whonix project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why I don’t see many advantages of torifying/enabling Tor services on the Host. All Tor activities should be done in the Whonix VM (it’s their purpose, after all), if and when the user chooses to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, Whonix-Host could ask Whonix-Gateway for time aka “ClockVM”.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe some kind of mechanism where <code>apt update</code> doesn’t fetch them by<br>
default but only when run with a specific flag? Is this even possible<br>
without being too complicated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adds a lot extra complexity for a minority use case that may be in state<br>
“operation succeed, patient dead”. Hard to test upgrades with one who<br>
uses apt-get hold vs apt-get non-hold.</p>
<p>And then also what we’d document? “Some packages don’t get upgraded by<br>
default because we want to hide Tor by default. If you want to upgrade<br>
all packages while hiding Tor, enable Whonix repository and upgrade over<br>
Tor when using precautions to hide Tor.” Sounds too geeky. Also “why I<br>
don’t get upgraded”, “well, you need to enable Whonix repository first<br>
but only do this if you don’t have to hide Tor”.</p>
<p>Due to [1] this is theoretic anyhow as there are other ways for a<br>
network observer of a non-torified desktop operating system to find out<br>
what “extremist” operating system is being run.</p>

<p>I have a laptop with debian stable as host.

<p>I would certainly not feel comfortable would it be otherwise. I don’t see the point of torifying my host - on the contrary it should look as benign and harmless as possible IMHO.</p>

<p>Russia for instance has banned Tor and VPN. I don’t know whether it is enforced or not. But it sure will be used against you if they need to pressure you. My point is: you could have very compelling reasons <strong>to not want</strong> to start any Tor activities unless you specifically want it. By torifying the host/starting Tor services by default we basically deprive the user from this choice.</p>

<p>I don’t know, maybe it could be, maybe not. But this is not within our control. We are powerless if using Linux is already suspicious or even dangerous. But starting Tor activities on boot is a choice we make for the user - and we can chose not to do so.</p>

</aside>
<p>It seems a bit drastic to me.<br>
In my understanding, we offer the following solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bootable ISO, basically a hardened debian, with Whonix Gateway/Workstation VM on virt-manager for amnesic use</li>
<li>this same ISO gives the user the possibility of installing the same system on hardware, to benefit from the same settings and config</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>This is why I don’t see many advantages of torifying/enabling Tor services on the Host. All Tor activities should be done in the Whonix VM (it’s their purpose, after all), if and when the user chooses to do so.</p>

            <p>It wouldn’t surprise me if certain countries would imprison you for using Tor. Especially countries where hardly any information about the goings on there gets out (e.g North Korea). I’ve had someone on Reddit tell me they lived in one of those countries and using Tor would get them imprisoned. They may have been one of those people thinking the “spooky deepweb” was illegal but I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I think Linux would attract attention. It seems it already does attract attention from the NSA as they label visitors of Linux Journal as “extremists”.</p>

<p>Only certain network hardening options will affect the network fingerprint but many people use these anyway as they’re basic hardening. I doubt these will single out Whonix users but if Whonix does more network hardening then it might.</p>
<p>It could be possible to have 2 builds. One for security and one for hiding Tor/Whonix at all costs. Or even add this as a boot parameter.</p>

</aside>

<p>Currently already the case for both, hardened debian and Whonix host.</p>
<p>Disadvantage being that we have to,</p>
<ul>
<li>install anon-connection-wizaard on the host too. (And then have user duplicate that work inside Whonix-Gateway.) [In theory, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OneVM" rel="nofollow noopener">OneVM</a> where Tor runs on the host would make more sense to avoid duplicate Tor config and duplicate Tor connections but OneVM may also be harder to get right in terms of leak protection, never thought that through.]</li>
<li>drop “give user option to not connect to the public Tor network”.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we have to choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>no secure time sync by default
<ul>
<li>use NTP</li>
<li>or use nonthing?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>drop “give user option to not connect to the public Tor network”</li>
<li>two Tor running by default (host and Whonix-Gateway)</li>
<li>OneVM alike (unrealistic mid term and perhaps even unrealistic ever?)</li>

</aside>
<p>I’ve head this before and acted as if it is true. Is there actually any evidence for that?</p>
<p>Does even The Tor Project with TBB connection wizard (tor-launcher) address the hiding Tor use case or only the censorship circumvention use case? It looks to me like the latter.</p>
<p>Being founder of Whonix project shouldn’t prevent me from asking learning questions. I’ll direct less energy on appearing professional and rather spend energy on getting better. I build Whonix which incorporates Tor but that doesn’t make me perfectly knowledgeable on the state of everything related to it such as in which countries it’s super dangerous to use.</p>
<p>In countries so draconian, does one already attract attention by being a Linux on the desktop user? Desktop use is less and less. Linux on desktop computer are few in numbers. Debian users then are a minority compared to Ubuntu users. Linux users are even fewer in draconian countries. So if singling out users is the goal, isn’t being a Debian at home desktop computer already so far away from mainstream people that this alone is suspicious enough?</p>
<p>Users of hardened debian and more so users of Whonix host are clearly users of the software by the Whonix project which is related to Tor. By following the quoted assumption, one could argue that using Whonix host and/or using hardened debian alone would put users at risk. (They’d be using Whonix repository.)</p>
<p>The current state of <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP" rel="nofollow noopener">Hide Tor and Whonix ™ use from the ISP</a> is really meager. It looks so difficult that I wonder if anyone is able to act good enough to actually hide Tor and Whonix from the ISP.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does a first time user in such an area learn about Tor without getting suspicious learning about Tor?</li>
<li>They’ll then get TBB and private obfuscated pluggable transports (bridges), then download Whonix and set up private obfuscated pluggable transports (bridges) there too?</li>
<li>Where they’ll get the private obfuscated pluggable transports (bridges) from in first place?</li>
</ul>
<p>I find this rather unrealistic. There may be a few users which manage to pull that off but perhaps that is in the single digits area?</p>
<p>Also this <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hide_Tor_and_Whonix_from_your_ISP" rel="nofollow noopener">quote</a> makes this really shaky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some pluggable transports may seek to obfuscate traffic or to morph it. However, they do not claim to hide that you are using Tor <em>in all cases</em> but rather in very specific cases. An example threat model includes a DPI device with limited time to make a classification choice - so the hiding is very specific to functionality and generally does not take into account endless data retention with retroactive policing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, by adding more and more <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/kernel-hardening/7296" class="inline-onebox">Kernel Hardening</a>, we could likely introduce a network <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Fingerprint" rel="nofollow noopener">fingerprint</a> which is unique to Whonix. Do we want to be less hardened and maybe not fingerprintable as Whonix users or do we want to be more hardened and more likely fingerprintable as Whonix users?</p>
<p>The state of <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Censorship_Circumvention_Tools" rel="nofollow noopener">censorship circumvention</a> in Whonix is unfortunately very limited anyhow. Anon connection wizard (frontend) is not being worked on, and the state of pluggable transports (backend) (the newest aren’t available outside of TBB anywhere as far as I know) doesn’t look better too.</p>
<p>The more I am thinking about it the more I am thinking “censorship circumvention may be possible but hiding Tor is unrealistic and should not be relied on”.</p>
<p>All of this mess makes me wonder if it would be best to tell such users “sorry, too difficult, we can’t help, go somewhere else”.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, I wasn’t aware of that. If you specifically refer to not having Tor / Whonix as default on the Hardened Debian, makes more sense for me.<br>
Not depending on updating from whonix sources is also a security advantage.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Exactly. Reason is that Tor services are already provided by the VMs, but should not be enabled on the host unless the user specifically wants it. If not installed, can be installed by the user at any time. Should be a choice, not a prerequisite. I know of many use cases where using Tor/Whonix-related activities automatically on the host would be a problem/danger.</p>

            <p>I didn’t follow all the discussions and perhaps am a bit confused here, but my understanding is that hardened debian is one project (indeed focused on security) and the whonix desktop / host is another, which was created to provide an easier integration of the host (the hardened debian, in fact) with the virtualizer and the VMs as we know them today. If that is so, there is no real reason to have Whonix desktop / host without Tor.<br>
Users that don’t need / face risks having Tor should only use the Hardened Debian, not Whonix desktop.</p>

            <p>Whonix Desktop (temporary name), based on the “Hardened Debian” project, and currently available for building as <code>whonix-host-xfce</code> flavor, is designed to be installed on physical hardware to act as a hardened debian host system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Confusing Hardened Debian for Whonix could be a distaste for someone who requires anonymity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The purpose of Hardened Debian/Whonix Host is not anonymity, but security. With that in mind, it could be even dangerous for some users to have Tor and Whonix services autostart on boot. In some cases, it could lead them to prison or serious problems (thinking about particular places where Tor is forbidden or a big red flag)</p>
<p>If they need Tor, they have the (already installed and configured) Whonix VMs with virt-manager at  their disposal, working out of the box.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we should assume that the user installing Whonix-Desktop on hardware does not want to have any Tor or other potentially suspicious networking or Whonix-related activity going on on his main machine without his explicit consent and activation.</p>
<p>Therefore I suggest to remove these packages from the Whonix-Desktop build, or at least disable them.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
