    <description>did anyone tried to use tutanota encrypted end-to-end email messages ?

r they true about what they&#39;re saying from protecting the privacy and ..etc ? so that we can advise ppl to use it?

if u dont know them , then this is their main website

            <p>I’m not going to read the thread but a general rule: Stay away from any service that wants to encrypt your email for you. Your keys should be on your machine and isolated from the browser and any code it runs.</p>

            <p>look at their bullshit design were deleted messages could come again due to maintenance ?? which mean messages never been deleted in the first place, just stored else where:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Restored Emails</p>
<p>Dear Tutanota user,</p>
<p>on Thursday, 29th of June, some previously deleted emails have accidentally been restored during maintenance of our servers. This only applies to emails deleted between the 12th and 25th of June. Please check whether there are emails in your mailbox that you’d rather have deleted. Affected users were partly not able to access their mailbox folders.</p>
<p>Background info</p>
<p>Emails in our database are replicated several times to make sure that no data is being lost. We have activated one of our database servers again which had been down for maintenance for a while. Unfortunately that server has executed some write requests that could not be completed before, thus some later deleted emails were restored. We have analyzed this bad behavior and made sure it will not happen again. We could only identify a part of those emails and remove them from the database. For transparency reasons it is our obligation to inform every Tutanota user about this. By informing you directly via email, you have a chance to spot remaining restored emails and delete them. We apologize for this issue.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
your Tutanota Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OH! they just admitted that they dont want any data to be lost , even the deleted one …</p>
<p>Tutanota has alot more disadvantages:</p>
<p>1- they <a href="https://tutanota.com/blog/posts/gdpr-compliant-email" rel="nofollow noopener">agreed</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" rel="nofollow noopener">GDPR</a>?<br>
2- not allowing users to use their ur own PGP , reason behind that you cant encrypt your subject = that sucks as who the hell told them to close this and not making it optional?<br>
3- no POP3,SMTP,IMAP<br>
4- Based in Germany? (yes Europe , but not really the best place)<br>
5- no hidden services entry to their website<br>
6- doesnt use double password to their email</p>

            <p>they r suspicious , hope no body will help them in the future.</p>
<p>c what happened with me:-</p>
<ul>
<li>my message to them:-</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>hello there , im a fan of ur email services. but today i got very suspicious activity when i logged in from my email:-</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>i looked at  “Folders” and “Sent” and “Trash” = ALL my past messages which i have deleted “permanently” been re-backed again in my email?!?!?!.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>the problem not because my deleted emails have been rebacked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>but because i have deleted them “permanently” as u have said when anyone want to delete any email message located in the trash.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>so either u r lying about the “permanently” and u r saving all our messages in ur servers, OR to be justice with u , u have to explain this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>impossible that a message can be reback again with a BUG !!! it must be that u r saving the messages. but tho i want to hear explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE:-</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You Have Only One Week To Explain This. Or Im Going To Spread This<br>
To The Security Websites And Press To Warn Them From Using Your  Manipulating Services.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if u want to play dirty then try me. if u want to play nice then give a reasonable explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>thnx</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>their reply:-</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it’s possible that you were parallel logged in with two clients and they were not synchronized. We can’t think of any other reason. But one thing is for sure: we do not lie and neither do we save your messages.</p>
