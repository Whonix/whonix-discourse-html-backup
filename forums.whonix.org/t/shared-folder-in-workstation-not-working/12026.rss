    <title>shared folder in workstation not working</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/shared-folder-in-workstation-not-working/12026</link>
    <description>Hi, I have followed the instructions in the official guide &gt; KVM section &gt; shared folder.

in host:
mkdir /home/user/shared
chmod 777 /home/user/shared

in ws virt-mgr details: did the same as in the official guide.

But when I start the ws, there is no shared folder. I rebooted all (incl. host) but still the same issue.

Any idea how to solve this?</description>

            <p>This is because of a bug in the shared folder service in the guest that prevented it from running and creating the needed folder. You will need to create a directory ‘/mnt/shared’</p>
<p>Run<code> sudo mkdir /mnt/shared</code> inside the guest.</p>
