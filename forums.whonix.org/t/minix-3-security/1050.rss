    <title>MINIX 3 security?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/minix-3-security/1050</link>
    <description>although it seems that the highest advised form of security is whonix+qubes or whonix+physical isolation, would a system with minix 3 as the host os and physical isolation between two whonix-running machines be even more secure?

this setup would seem to be even more secure than qubes, since the minix kernel only contains ~6000 LOC, versus Xen&#39;s &gt;150,000. Combined with physical isolation, it would appear that this setup would be the most secure. What are your opinions on the matter?</description>
