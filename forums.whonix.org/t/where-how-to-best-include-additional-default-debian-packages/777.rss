    <description>Branching off of this discussion....

https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,842.0.html

I&#39;d like to sort out where/how we would best include additional Debian packages for default installation into Whonix Qubes going forward?

For example, as mentioned in the other thread above, I would like to have &quot;nautilus-open-terminal&quot; installed by default for Whonix Qubes.

https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/nautilus-open-terminal

It seems by other recent discussions of @Patrick and @nrgaway, that some related issues/components of the new Whonix Qubes are still in flux.

Patrick mentioned the following here:

https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,842.msg6272.html#msg6272

[quote=&quot;Patrick, post:6, topic:765&quot;][quote]Maybe better to incorporate into the new &quot;whonix-qubes&quot; package for Whonix Qubes only?[/quote]
Yes. Maybe as [font=courier]Recommends:[/font]? [font=courier]Depends:[/font] would be weird, having a package that works perfectly well in terminal-only depend on a GUI package, no?

Please note this comment, it&#39;s related:

Patrick mentioned the following here:

https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,841.msg6271.html#msg6271

[quote=&quot;Patrick, post:15, topic:764&quot;]The whonix-qubes packages uses a few Recommends::
https://github.com/nrgaway/whonix-qubes/blob/master/debian/control#L22

This is fine. Other packages by the Whonix project do this as well. But... You you need to know it has little effect.

Whonix&#39;s build script installs all packages using &quot;apt-get --no-install-recommends&quot;. Reasons for that are a bit weird and difficult, but explained here:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Debian_Packages#Technical_Stuff

So care to you get the [font=courier]Recommends:[/font] installed by default and plan to install the whonix-qubes package as part of [font=arial]build-steps.d/1700_install-packages[/font] or some [url=https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/]anon-meta-package[/url], then recommends would not be installed by default. We&#39;d have to think of something. If you install it as part of the Qubes build process somehow without using --no-install-recommends then there will be no problem.

It&#39;s just something to be aware of.[/quote]

Patrick mentioned the following here:

https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,850.msg6277.html#msg6277

[quote=&quot;Patrick, post:2, topic:771&quot;]I wouldn&#39;t advice making the whonix-qubes package a jack of all trades device, though. I.e. not be 1) ship Whonix specific configs and scripts for Qubes support + 2) depend on lots of custom package selections. (That doesn&#39;t mean, I am opposed to it! Just saying.) It would be better to split the package into 1) and for dependencies (2)) another package. Perhaps package the mainline https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages better so the whonix-qubes package has to do as little as possible.[/quote]

Note: &quot;whonix-qubes&quot; package has now been renamed to &quot;qubes-whonix&quot;.

So, specific to Whonix Qubes, where exactly would we include such additional default Debian packages and how would they be best implemented?

Thanks! :D</description>

[font=courier]Recommends:[/font] can be removed.
<blockquote>I know you mentioned that Whonix does not install recommends by default,</blockquote>
Yes, here:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Debian_Packages#Technical_Stuff
<p>Note, this only applies to building Whonix and to build-steps.d/1700_install-packages.</p>
<blockquote>so we could just add a script to install qubes-whonix recommends by default as I would like them to be installed.</blockquote>
Instead of a new script, better make "--no-install-recommends" conditional in build-steps.d/1700_install-packages and set qubes-whonix to install without "--no-install-recommends".
<blockquote>Or maybe this is possible... Two versions of qubes-whonix package would exist.</blockquote>
Sounds like too much of a hack.
<p>Better make two or more (meta) packages. You don’t even need a new git repository for it. Just ~8 more lines or so in debian/control.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control">https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control</a> for comparison. It’s relatively easy to create such dependency packages.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: qubes-whonix-packages-recommended
Architecture: all
Depends: nautilus-open-terminal, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Recommended packages for Whonix-Qubes
 A metapackage, which installs packages, which are recommended for
 Whonix-Qubes.
 .
 Safe to remove, if you know what you are doing.</code></pre>
<p>Then a package qubes-whonix-packages-recommended will be created during package build.</p>
<p>That package is supposed to be installed on gateway and workstation? Otherwise package name should be changed. Please check package names in <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control">https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/blob/master/debian/control</a> so we can establish a nice, useful naming convention.</p>

<p>Okay then, I added it to current qubes-whonix package.  Will see how it goes.  The only issue I see is if its a depend it can’t be removed.  Does the same hold true if it is within the recommend section?  I know you mentioned that Whonix does not install recommends by default, so we could just add a script to install qubes-whonix recommends by default as I would like them to be installed.</p>
<p>Or maybe this is possible… Two versions of qubes-whonix package would exist.  The installation version which gets installed only once when the template is initially created.  This version series would be 0:9.4-1.  Then we could have the download-able version via the apt-get repo with a higher version number or epoc, so either 1:9.4-1 or start at 0:9.40-1, or even add a lesser important tag like -beta which will be seen as a lesser version and be up-gradable.</p>
<p>Now, first time user goes to update, the higher version package will be made available with all these dependencies removed in debian/control, so after the new package is installed, they would be free to remove those packages.  All futures updates use the higher version number bump as installation package will only every be needed the first time.</p>
<p>Now this assumes that by reducing the depends would not automatically mark those packages for removal.  Any thoughts on if this would work?  Easy enough to test out I suppose <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/troubadour">@troubadour</a> responeded in affirmation to this, as he frequently needs this functionality to transition from file manager to terminal in the current working directory of the file manager.</p>
<p>He pointed out how KDE Dolphin finds this basic feature important enough to include by default.</p>
<p>However, the file manager with primary Qubes functionality in Whonix Qubes is Nautilus, which Tor Browser (Firefox) natively opens its downloads inside of, and Qubes also implements its Inter-VM File Copy system inside of Nautilus as well.</p>
<p>So it would be a fundamental basic convenience in many cases to use the primary Nautilus file manager in this way for Whonix Qubes users (including myself). <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks for that overview of the build process!</p>
<p>At some point I need to get around to deep diving into the code of Whonix Qubes.</p>
<p>Spent a bit of time getting more familiar with the Whonix code late last year. Need to do that with your Whonix Qubes code at some point.</p>
<p>Will likely have a number of questions as I get around to doing that.</p>

<p>This is fine. Other packages by the Whonix project do this as well. But… You you need to know it has little effect.</p>
<p>Whonix’s build script installs all packages using “apt-get --no-install-recommends”. Reasons for that are a bit weird and difficult, but explained here:<br>

<p>Which Whonix ™ Debian packages are safe to remove? What is a meta package? What other packages do Whonix ™ meta packages install? Which packages should never be removed? Why is package X installed?</p>

<p>So care to you get the [font=courier]Recommends:[/font] installed by default and plan to install the whonix-qubes package as part of [font=arial]build-steps.d/1700_install-packages[/font] or some <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">anon-meta-package</a>, then recommends would not be installed by default. We’d have to think of something. If you install it as part of the Qubes build process somehow without using --no-install-recommends then there will be no problem.</p>
<p>It’s just something to be aware of.[/quote]</p>

<p>I wouldn’t advice making the whonix-qubes package a jack of all trades device, though. I.e. not be 1) ship Whonix specific configs and scripts for Qubes support + 2) depend on lots of custom package selections. (That doesn’t mean, I am opposed to it! Just saying.) It would be better to split the package into 1) and for dependencies (2)) another package. Perhaps package the mainline <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Whonix/anon-meta-packages</a> better so the whonix-qubes package has to do as little as possible.</p>

<p>Note: “whonix-qubes” package has now been renamed to “qubes-whonix”.</p>
<p>So, specific to Whonix Qubes, where exactly would we include such additional default Debian packages and how would they be best implemented?</p>
