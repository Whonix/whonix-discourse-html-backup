    <title>A few workstations with one gateway, ip conflicts</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/a-few-workstations-with-one-gateway-ip-conflicts/6071</link>
    <description>Dear community,

The manual says that it&#39;s possible to connect any guest os as a workstation and provides with settings, including ip, mask, gateway, but what if there is a need to connect 2-3 workstations with one Whonix gateway, is it enough just to set up another internal virtual adaptor with another IP manually? 

What kind of problems and security flaws it may cause?
How to avoid them?

Thanks</description>
