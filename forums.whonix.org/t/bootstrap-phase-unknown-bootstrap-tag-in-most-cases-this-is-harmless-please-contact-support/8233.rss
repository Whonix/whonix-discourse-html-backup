<p>Parallel installation of VirtualBox and KVM at the same time is either difficult or impossible. Leftovers of VirtualBox might break KVM (networking or everything) and vice versa.</p>
<p>This is more likely a general KVM installation issue rather than Whonix issue. To fix this, you’d have to make sure that networking is functional in KVM VMs generally before using Whonix.</p>
