    <title>Isn&#39;t locale indication dangerous to anonymity?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/isnt-locale-indication-dangerous-to-anonymity/446</link>
    <description>Just installed the new updates today for my whonix, it was coming to my attention that the &quot;locale&quot; and UTC- (my time) was shown as well. 

Furthermore, I realized my system has been at the same time as my real location every time when I finished the time synchronization, and I did not remember this was the way before.

Is this everyone&#39;s situation or just mine?

Is this dangerous for exposing real location and IP?</description>

            <p>“the new updates” is a bit unspecific. Did you use these instructions <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_8_to_Whonix_9">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_8_to_Whonix_9</a> ?</p>
<blockquote>Just installed the new updates today for my whonix, it was coming to my attention that the "locale" and UTC- (my time) was shown as well.</blockquote>
Shown? You mean locally shown in terminal? That's not an issue. And UTC is on purpose. A shared value as per https://github.com/Whonix/timezone-utc and https://github.com/Whonix/anon-base-files. There is no way to use "no timezone". So UTC is best here.
<blockquote>Furthermore, I realized my system has been at the same time as my real location every time when I finished the time synchronization, and I did not remember this was the way before.</blockquote>
[Using your real time zone on your host and UTC inside Whonix VMs is expected.]
<p>What do you mean by “as my real location”? You mean the clock in your VM exactly matches the time on your host or how much approximate difference there is?</p>
<p>In that case please run</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>in terminal and/or check /var/log/sdwdate.log and see what it says.</p>

Should be fixed as per https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync.
