    <title>Gateway error? Package manager running (&quot;apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate&quot; exit</title>

    <description>I have been having this window poping up in my whonix gateway.

The timesync window is automatically opened but never finishes, and another small window &quot;Whonixcheck&quot;  Whonix-gateway 8-debpackage1&quot;

A Package manager is currently running. (&quot;apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate&quot; exit code: 100) Waiting for it to finish...

Nothing happens.

This have been going on for a week now hope its not something serious, like security hole or something in my system.</description>

            <p>Do what whonixcheck advices right in that message. It mentions three commands. Try those and post them here if still needed.</p>

            <p>It’s a bug in whonixcheck / timesync. Should be gone after reboot. Worth to be fixed, nothing to worry about.</p>
