    <title>[SOLVED] Inconsistency in GPG key howto?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-inconsistency-in-gpg-key-howto/112</link>
    <description>Now that a new version of Whonix is out, this is probably actual.

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key

It says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. Store it as adrelanos.asc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

but then

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. Import the key:

gpg --import patrick.asc&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Did it happen because the second occurence of &quot;adrelanos&quot; wasn&#39;t replaced by mistake as well, now that the main Whonix developer decided to go open about his identity?

Of course the filename is just a placeholder, but this inconsistence can confuse less experienced users who are making their first steps with GPG and are just following the howto step by step.</description>

            <p>Sure, should be corrected. Fixed the inconsistent naming.</p>
<p>Yes happened because of this. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/blog/giving-up-pseudonymity-after-collecting-experiences-with-pseudonymous-project-development/" data-bbcode="true">giving up pseudonymity after collecting experiences with pseudonymous project development</a>)</p>
