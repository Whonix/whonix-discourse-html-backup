    <title>Having to reinstall applications every boot</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/having-to-reinstall-applications-every-boot/8314</link>
    <description>As the title suggests, I have been having to reinstall applications like KGpg and Wickr every time I reboot Qubes-Whonix and I am unsure why this is. When I was using KGpg it was bearable simply because it was a small file that only took 30 seconds to reinstall but having to reinstall Wickr every time will not do, which can take up to 10-15 minutes. Has anyone else had trouble with this? I am completely new to this OS. Any help would greatly be appreciated.</description>

            <p>Welcome to the forums and thank you for your question!</p>
<p>This is a Qubes - not a Whonix question. This is the basic Qubes behavior. Qubes-Whonix only inherits this. Equally any TemplateBasedVM in Qubes is affected by this. For example the same would happen with a Qubes Debian TempalteBased AppVM.</p>
<p>For changes in in Qubes root image to persist, these changes need to be made either in a TemplateVM or in a StandaloneVM.</p>
