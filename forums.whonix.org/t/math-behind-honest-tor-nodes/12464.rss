    <description># Math behind honest Tor nodes
First: I&#39;m sorry to post it in &quot;Support&quot;, but general Tor talk is disabled and I don&#39;t know of any other Tor community that knows math/research. You basically support my understanding about the network.

My question: How can I calculate how much impact X honest Tor relays have?
Is it better to calculate with bandwidth consumed (250Gbps), despite the number of relays (~7000)?

Basically, I want to get the mathematical equation to this statement:
``
I run X Tor relays at Y Mb/s each and by doing so I secure Z % of the Tor network!
``

## Starting thoughts:
- Each &quot;normal&quot; route has three nodes involved: Guard, Middle, Exit
- I am aware of guard pinning and vanguard protection for middle node pinning
- Maybe it is easier to assume an infinite usage time of the network to eliminate guard and vanguard pinning 
- I guess the best is to assume a scenario with 1%, 5%, 10%, etc dishonest servers.

I would love to hear your thoughts about it and a concrete math equation would be amazing.</description>
