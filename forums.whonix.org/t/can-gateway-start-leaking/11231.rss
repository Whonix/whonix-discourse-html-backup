    <title>can gateway start leaking?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/can-gateway-start-leaking/11231</link>
    <description>I was updating Whonix-Gateway and it hang while unpacking-replacing some system package. I had no choice but to “force power off” gateway. 
I start gateway again and try updating again. System suggested to do &quot;dpkg --configure -a”. I did it. It’ looks like everything updated without errors. I try using workstation and everything seems working fine. But it raises some doubt and question for me.

Can gateway be “damaged” in such situations and start causing leaks that i can’t see ? Maybe gateways important config files can be somehow changed/altered or set to default and that can cause gateway start leaking in some channels ?</description>
