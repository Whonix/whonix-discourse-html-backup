    <title>Possible Tor Browser/Whonix Leak</title>

    <description>Hello,

I am using Qubes 4.1 last fully updated a couple of days ago. I have not made any modifications. My hardware has not been compromised.

I launched the Tor Browser in a disposable Whonix Workstation.

I checked ipleak and confirmed my ip was hidden and was instead an exit node in another country.

When searching in the top bar I got a message in the browser that my connection was reset.

I hit enter to search again, and I was taken to a Duck Duck Go page with the language set to that of my home country and not the exit node.

When checking ipleak again after I saw only the exit node in a foreign country again.

Unfortunately the duck duck go search does not show ip, but the very unusual behaviour of selecting a very specific non-American country of location concerns me.

I often get sdwdate errors, I am unsure if this is related.

I should also mention that my search terms were not in my own language so they could not have detected it that way.</description>

</aside>
<p>Tor keeps changing the Tor circuit and has exit relays in many different countries which also keep changing, specifically if a previous Tor circuit was previously unusable by Tor (as simple as a Tor relay restart due to applying operating system updates leading to a Tor circuit being down and user experiencing connection reset). Also no evidence of a leak.</p>
