    <title>PGP signed donation addresses</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/pgp-signed-donation-addresses/5999</link>
    <description>I noticed that the various donation addresses listed [here](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Donate) are not pgp signed by @patrick. IMHO, it would be good practice to have these in a pgp signed file linked from that page to authenticate.

Qubes does it in their [security pack](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/tree/master/fund).

Thanks for reading. :slight_smile:</description>
