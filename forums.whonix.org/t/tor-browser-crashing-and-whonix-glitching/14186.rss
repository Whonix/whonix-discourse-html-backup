    <description>Hoping someone could help.

I have installed Virtualbox as per the instructions here:
`https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/Recommended_Version`

* I am running the latest kicksecure as my host on bare metal
Also Running Latest Debian kernel and linux-headers as instructed.

* vtx and vtd are both enabled as well in bios settings.
workstation and gateway both have 2gb of ram
Also have given both 128mb of vram

* I am Having alot of issues in terms of whonix glitching and displaying random colors here and there and also core dumps.

The main issue is:
* Tor Browser is consistently crashing as well giving the error:

```
ERROR: Tor Browser ended with non-zero (error) exit code!

Tor Browser was started with:

/home/user/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser --verbose --allow-remote . 

Tor Browser exited with code: 139 

```
I tried to update tor browser but still having the same issue with it.
I had this issue running on regular non kicksecure debian 11 host as well.

Downgrading the host kernel fixed the issue on my other machine
But i don&#39;t want to downgrade my kernel on this kicksecure machine.
Other vitrual machines are not suffering the same issue despite the kernel version.

Thanks.</description>

<p>This means the issue can be reproduced without Kicksecure involved?<br>
Plus on top of this this means the issue can be reproduced without Whonix being involved?</p>
<p>In that case, the issue is unspecific to Kicksecure / Whonix:</p>
