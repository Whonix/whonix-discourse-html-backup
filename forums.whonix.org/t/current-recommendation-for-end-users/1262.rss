    <title>Current recommendation for End-Users?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/current-recommendation-for-end-users/1262</link>
    <description>I understand Qubes + Whonix is still &#39;In Development&#39; and may present bugs in the future.

At this stage of development, would it be considered stable enough for tech-literate end-users to install?
Or would you recommend continuing to use VirtualBox + Whonix?

If viable, would you recommend Qubes 2 + Whonix 9 or Qubes 3 + Whonix 10?

Can physical isolation be combined with Qubes + Whonix presently?
Host1: Qubes + Whonix Gateway; Host2: Qubes + Whonix Workstation
If yes, does any documentation exist?

Your work is much appreciated.</description>

            <p>Good questions. However, there are too many pros- and cons at the moment on both sides. So I don’t have a good answer yet. Most likely with Whonix 12 I will be certain, that I would recommend Qubes over VirtualBox. For now, not sure.</p>
<p>In the long run - IF physical isolation emerges for Qubes - then I think it would be better to run the gateway within a VM. (So a compromised network driver does not result in a full system compromise.)</p>

            <p>I’ll rephrase the question: Patrick, since you are now working full-time on developing Qubes + Whonix and are no longer actively developing VirtualBox + Whonix, it seems at some point you will recommend that Whonix users transition away from VirtualBox to Qubes. Has that time arrived yet? Although there may not be a decisive winner in the virtualizer debate, VirtualBox has been the declared winner (whether for non-security related reasons, ie usability) since it has been the default Whonix setup.</p>

<p>I don’t really know. The virtualizer argument could be extended ad infinitum.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Does this mean that the Whonix portion of both solutions are identically stable/secure? In other words, the risk of both systems now resides with the virtualizer only?</p>
<p>edit: Another major motivation for wanting to use Qubes is the secure clipboard and file transfer. So all else equal, I’m looking for permission to make the transition.</p>
<p>With regards to Physical Isolation with Qubes + Whonix: Is it correct to assume that it would be more secure since an attacker would have to compromise (using Rutkowska’s terminology from <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2014/08/physical-separation-vs-software.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2014/08/physical-separation-vs-software.html</a>) 2 sets of Xen net front/back ends + the networking drivers/stack, as opposed to just 1 set of Xen net front/back ends?<br>
Also, should Gateway be installed on hardware per the VirtualBox setup? Or combined with Qubes? It isn’t obvious to me which is more secure.</p>

No documentation available. TODO: research. Don't hold your breath for it. Contributions welcome.
