    <description>there is th idea of a panic button that whipes the whole ram. how long would that take?
is there a command/feature/bug that lets the ram module whipe its memory without having to access each address?
if whiping takes too long would it be better to have a laptop run with unscrewed ram cover and in an emergency rip out the module(s) and break them?</description>

Not too long. RAM is fast.

Not that I know.

Probably not.

<p>This is something that host operating systems such as Debian and Fedora would have to implement. Someone could take <a href="http://git.tails.boum.org/wiperam/">http://git.tails.boum.org/wiperam/</a>, polish, and upload to Debian.</p>
