    <description>I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t motivate myself to join this community sooner than now, but I&#39;ve been a Whonix user for quite awhile.  It&#39;s so well built that I havent had any issues until now, or at least I&#39;d thought that to be the case.  At any rate, I have two questions here for someone that knows more about this than I do! 

I see this task [bioset] in dom0 when i have a ws and gw running on the hypervisor, but I can&#39;t find anything online that&#39;s really too informative about the possible issue relating to Qubes-os 3.2

The other question is the same question but about these tasks that are called [1.xvdb-0].  

I checked and the [Bioset] task runs in Dom0 when whonix is not running as well, but when it is running there&#39;s 10x the amount of instances than when it isn&#39;t.  Same goes for the [1.xvdb-0] processes as well, they are in ascending order in this case though, not the identical name as with [bioset]  If anyone could give me some insight into these two items please do, I would greatly appreciate it!</description>

It’s because it’s a dom0 internals question.</p>
