    <title>The Qubes Project is paricipating in Season of Docs 2019</title>

    <description>As I&#39;m sure many of our community members have heard, our partners at the [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) project are mentoring a technical writer for Google Season of Docs ([GSoD](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)) 2019. Since much of my [project proposal](https://forums.whonix.org/t/document-installation-and-setup-of-the-new-security-focused-hardened-debian-linux-distribution-selected-by-whonix-for-season-of-docs-2019/7887) for Whonix was based, in large part, on ideas from our community. I&#39;m sure many of your ideas would be well received by  Lukas à Porta
(aka luzeal) the Qubes technical writer.

Having said that, if Lukas or anyone else would like to use this thread to post information that would be useful to anyone in the Qubes-Whonix community that would like to collaborate with the Qubes project. They are most welcome to do so.
