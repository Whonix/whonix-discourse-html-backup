    <title>Apt GPG error - signature could not be verified</title>

    <description>Hi guys !

Waking up this morning, running a whonixcheck as usual, got some packages to update, running an apt-get update, but got an : 
[code]
W: An error occurred during the signature verification [...] couldn&#39;t be verified because the public key is not available : NO_PUBKEY CB8D50BB77BB3C48
W: Failed to fetch http://souceforge[...]whonixdevelopermetafiles[...]dists/stable/InRelease[/code]

and the &#39;classical&#39;
[code]W: Failed to fetch http://deb.torproject[...]tor-0.2.4.x-jessie[...][/code]

This last one is ok since I understand what had going on.
But the two first  worried me a bit. 

Did something happen this night ? I know adrelanos changed is GPG key, is it related ? I guess no.
Am I the only one getting this ? 

Thanks.
(Btw, great move on the pseudonimity adrelanos)


Edit : Restored a previous state of the VM, just in case it somehow have been compromised or whatever, having the same issue.</description>

<p>I hope this won’t be necessary. I was planing to sign the repository with both keys for a transitional period. And deploying the new key by an upgrade signed by my old key.</p>
<p>So unless you’re at some point in future updating a very old build of Whonix, I hope it won’t be necessary to manually get my key.</p>

            <p>Thank for the clarification Adrelanos, I just added the new keys to apt. I was only waiting for a confirmation of your keys change.</p>

            <p>Thank you for reporting this. Nothing to worry about. My mistake. Fixed. (Should work again in 10 minutes as usual.)</p>
<p>(Technical background: I refreshed (valid-until) the signature of Whonix’s apt repository. Gpg automatically choose my new gpg key, which hasn’t been added to apt’s keys yet. Made the choice of the key explicit.)</p>
