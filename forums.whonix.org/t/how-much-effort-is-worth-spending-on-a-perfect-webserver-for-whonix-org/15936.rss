    <description> https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-source-code-in-self-hosted-git/15934/2

&gt; What&#39;s the big advantage of a git (or any) server self-hosted by Whonix compared to any git branch in any git repository anywhere or git patch format? And is the extra effort really justified for the maintenance required for that webapp? Maintenance required: initial setup, keeping it updated, backups and restoration testing, archival, troubleshooting if something breaks...

From my experience with other webapps...

* wordpress blog (updating was messy, kept breaking),
* discourse forums (hard to resolve update issues, database issues),
* mediawiki (update issues, database issues),
* phabrictor (deprecated even though one would thing that&#39;s unlikely given it was in use by at least two major users such as wikipedia and facebook)

...that&#39;s hours and hours of work that are spend on a perfect webserver rather than on software development.

More generally... Not just about git... Any webapp or server setup... The issue is that the demands from a small vocal minority of highly technical users lead a lot of project resources being redirected that aren&#39;t really beneficial for the core of Whonix which is the actual downloadable software or source code. Such as:

* all software on the server must only be using Freedom Software
* ideally the server would be self-hosted in a developer&#39;s private home (not hosted at a server provider)
* JavaScript free webapp or at least basic non-JavaScript support
* the webapp must not have anti-features such as cookies, tracking
* no loading of third-party content (such as fonts, CSS, scripts, let alone analytics)
* no use of a CDN
* the webapp must have perfect security
* the webapp must be under constant development and be constantly updated by upstream and downstream

These ideal-world requirements are commendable but realistically I wonder these have hold back too much the software development of Whonix. By comparison, the official Tor Project forums forums.torproject.net, by an organisation with much more funding, multiple full time staff, are currently cloud hosted by a third party, discourse which includes IP logging.

<p>I disagree in some regards, at least when open source tools are used. It swings the pendulum <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Perhaps an “almost invisible” effort, but using a tool like gitea would give more power to the project gitea</p>
<p>Again, not saying we should self host at this juncture in time,  but I feel the need to give my opinion anyway</p>

<li>potential reputational loss if a hack occurs. I am not a terrible sysadmin by any means, but I am a human and much more specialized on infra automation as my day job. Security is something I have learned a good bit, but could still spend a lifetime and not know it all. I could make a mistake, a hack would be embarrassing to the project.</li>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Another great point I wish I had in mind when writing above bullet points. Self-hosting doesn’t have good incentive structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>If all goes well, it’s invisible effort.</li>
<li>If it gets hacked, it’s probably resulting in FUD (related: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust#Server_Security">Placing Trust in Whonix ™ chapter Server Security in Whonix wiki</a>) and ridicule.</li>
<li>If using third-party hosting such as github and <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/120981-github-hacked-millions-of-projects-at-risk-of-being-modified-or-deleted">github gets hacked</a>, then it’s just a third party that got hacked and the reputation of the project that was using github remains stainless.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even security experts don’t claim that they can absolutely secure a webserver / webapps form ever getting hacked. Usually the more of a security expert they are, the more modest they are, the more careful they are to avoid making bold claims of something being secure.</p>

<p>Again, i could go either way. I want to make the project better and dont care about my ego. Of course i think creating a webserver ( not whonix owned) on <a href="http://gitfoss.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitfoss.org</a> is a good idea, i bought the domain. But my ego is less important than whonix continuing to succeed for many more years</p>

It is difficult for me to argue again on my point because I don’t want<br>

If the burden of maintenance is worth the organization of issues, then<br>
maybe?</p>
