    <description>Printer yellow dots are small dots that encode identifiable information into all printed pages. This has been used since the 1980s to track people.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Identification_Code

There is a tool called DEDA to anonymize these and prevent tracking.

It would be nice to include this in Whonix/Kicksecure to protect whistleblowers and such. It would mainly be useful for Whonix host.

Tails is looking into including this.

There has been some criticism by the MAT2 developer.

https://lists.autistici.org/message/20200308.154747.1b4d1245.en.html

&gt; Unfortunately, the way DEDA works is working, from my understanding, is by calibrating itself on &quot;known bad&quot; documents, meaning that it doesn&#39;t provide a generic solution.
&gt;
&gt; A better solution would be to render the documents in black and white, since the yellow marks will likely be rounded to white, but this will make non-textual documents barely usable/readable. Like pdf-redact-tool ( https://github.com/firstlookmedia/pdf-redact-tools ) is doing.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe I should add such option to mat2, behind a `--paranoid` flag?</description>

<p>
 A Machine Identification Code (MIC), also known as printer steganography, yellow dots, tracking dots or secret dots, is a digital watermark which certain color laser printers and copiers leave on every single printed page, allowing identification of the device with which a document was printed and giving clues to the originator. Developed by Xerox and Canon in the mid-1980s, its existence became public only in 2004. In 2018, scientists developed privacy software to anonymize prints in order to ...</p>
