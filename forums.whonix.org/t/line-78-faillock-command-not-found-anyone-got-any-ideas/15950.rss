    <description>I upgraded whonix from terminal and now I can not start the workstation.
Gateway starts fine, but workstation starts with username and password (which it has never asked for before).

Any ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.
I have tried user and changeme, but it does not seem to work.
