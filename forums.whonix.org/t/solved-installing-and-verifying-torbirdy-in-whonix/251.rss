    <description>I&#39;m trying to add enigmail and torbirdy to icedove in whonix and in trying to check torbirdy but the link to Jacob Appelbaum&#39;s OpenPGP key is like from 2012 (which i tried anyway, and it [u]didn&#39;t[/u] check out). So I was wondering if anyone else has tried this or has his new key or had this problem?</description>

            <p>As an aside: Torbirdy will hopefully be added to the debian repos and then Whonix. A hardened email client is a real necessity.</p>

            <p>Understanding that warning is worth it nevertheless.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_the_command_line</a> it’s written:<br>
“This doesn’t alter the validity of the signature according to the key you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you put in Whonix signing key and the web of trust (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OpenPGP#The_OpenPGP_Web_of_Trust</a>). To remove this warning you would have to personally sign Whonix signing key with your own key.”</p>
<p>I don’t have a better explanation for this, so I recommend reading a few other explanations attempts on the web.</p>

            <p>ok, so I have more to learn about pgp, sorry, I am a newb at this. I honestly thought that:<br>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!<br>
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.<br>
Primary key fingerprint: 228F AD20 3DE9 AE7D 84E2  5265 CF9A 6F91 4193 A197<br>
Subkey fingerprint: E729 FE2D EE92 DB51 1AC9  FF91 590C 7D91 1245 F783</p>
<p>was not good and telling me that this was not the real deal. but if all i need to see is “Good signature”, I am now assuming that is the important part, then it was good all along.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
