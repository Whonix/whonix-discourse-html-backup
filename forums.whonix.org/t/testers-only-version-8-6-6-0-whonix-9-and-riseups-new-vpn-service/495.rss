    <description>Hi Patrick hope your whonix adventures are going fine,anyway I decided to do some of my own tests on the testers only version 8.6.6.0   this is not the newest testers version though by the time i fined out it wasn&#39;t the newest I had already finished my tests,anyway I think I should still share my testing results with you.The first test I did was to see if it could recognized a revoked security certificate as this image explains http://gyazo.com/4be8e9b2f6ed5ce7fe999c66f1158e51  and here are the results 

http://gyazo.com/815c886f9f8462056cb57ade0bccbedc   the 2nd test was called &quot;DNS nameserver spoofability test&quot; i&#39;ll give you a couple of the results since there is too many  http://gyazo.com/74f37587d5b9a82f95a06c64385ecfb9

http://gyazo.com/d9b1fde6a321e4e141c4b76506ca542c  and this might help explain whats going on

next I did another test to see how much info this website could get just by visiting it         

http://gyazo.com/918e7c70b574c7849694bb17af49cd80 finally i&#39;ve done a flashleak test

Now for the 2nd topic,have you heard of Riseup&#39;s new VPN? https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn/why-is-needed    it uses the LEAP technology and aims  this VPN is more  user friendly according to them,but as I remember you saying all VPNs have that close-mechanism problem if I remembered correctly,is it possible to solve that security issue?Also whats your opinion on Rise&#39;s ups new VPN?</description>
