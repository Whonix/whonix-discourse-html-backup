    <title>WhonixGateway works gr8, whonix workstation stop at login service!</title>

    <description>Hey there. I&#39;m not new to whonix and I use it from a lot of time always with VirtualBox.
However since VB always gave me problems of instability I decided to try KVM. 

I installed KVM on Lubuntu, latest stable version if that matters.
What I did was following the official guide about KVM on whonix wiki. 

With a little difference. B4 importing the images I edited the .xml files.
Simply I changed their location to NOT store the machine files in the default location that is used by KVM.   

Cause I wanted both of them to stay in a Veracrypt volume. 
Tried whonix gateway and it works gr8. Both the graphical version, both the other version with 192 mb of RAM.
It&#39;s super fast, maybe more than VirtualBox. 

Anyway whonix workstation doesn&#39;t work. At the very first boot it&#39;s does stop right after the &quot;Starting Login Manager (graphical desktop environment)  kdm in 10 seconds, unless you abort using ctrl +c bla bla blabla&quot;

After that:

Failed to start login service...
Stopping login service...
stopped login service.
Starting login service...
Stopping login service...
stopped login service.
Starting login service...

And it continues for a few times than this happens: 

Failed to start network manager
Could not start kdm. Please report this bug!

Why whonix gateway works gr8 and workstation doesnt?</description>

            <p>I doubt it, for my uses anyway. It didn’t have anything to do with the problems reported here.</p>

            <p>Could be that Whonix-Gateway KVM has too less RAM by default nowadays?<br>

            <p>Yep the image of course was verified. I always verify the images.</p>
<p>Anyway it looks like I fixed my problem by simply updating via apt-get.<br>
So I pressed ctrl +c to prevent the start of kde.<br>
Once I did the upgrade via terminal I restarted the machine and this time I had the chance to log in and finish the starting setup.<br>
Now it looks everything is fine</p>
