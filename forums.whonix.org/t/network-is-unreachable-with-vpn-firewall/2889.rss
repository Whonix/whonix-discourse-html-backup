    <title>Network is unreachable with VPN_Firewall</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/network-is-unreachable-with-vpn-firewall/2889</link>
    <description>Hello, I finally get Whonix working on my PC. But now there are some problems with networking.

I use OpenVPN client on my host computer and then launch Whonix-Gateway. In this case Tor working correctly.

But in other, I start VPN_Firewall by Adrelanos (I prefer old version, it is much simple and it had worked correctly before with earlier Whonix versions) and then I&#39;ve got errors in Whonix-Gateway. 

Tor progress stuck at 80% and the reason is &quot;Network is unreachable&quot;.

How can I repair my Gateway? 

And how this error is possible? Without VPN enabled nothing can reach Internet. And when I enable VPN everything have to rout through that VPN. And it seems like Whonix-Gateway want to rout to Internet not through VPN. Am I right?

Thank You!</description>

            <p>VPN-Firewall on the host might be blocking something that KVM requires.<br>
I did not test VPN-Firewall compatibility with KVM.</p>
<p>If there is an issue, then no operating system inside KVM should work.<br>
Not just Whonix. Can you try that?</p>
<p>Old versions of VPN-Firewall are unsupported.</p>
<p>For the current version of VPN-Firewall, if that is an issue, feel free<br>
to report a bug on github. Perhaps someone would fix it but it would<br>
probably take a long time until I will find time to look into it.</p>

            <p>I understand you saw this when running Whonix KVM however this seems a Whonix specific problem and not something to do with KVM.</p>
