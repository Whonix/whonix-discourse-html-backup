    <title>KVM vs VBOX in Linux Is it really worth it?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kvm-vs-vbox-in-linux-is-it-really-worth-it/2093</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;ve been using tor in vbox for a lot of time. Recently I decided to move to KVM. After a hard instalation full of errors and misunderstantings, I was able to run both machines. The problem? Workstation is very slow, completely freezing, while in VBOX it moves very smooth. 

My question is, is it really worth changing KVM over VBOX? Maybe I am omiting some security features that KVM include and vbox no

Thank you</description>
