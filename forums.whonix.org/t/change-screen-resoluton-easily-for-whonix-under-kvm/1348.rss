    <title>Change screen resoluton (easily) for Whonix under KVM?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/change-screen-resoluton-easily-for-whonix-under-kvm/1348</link>
    <description>I know there are instructions in the wiki for Virtualbox version, but the section on KVM at the bottom is quite esoteric and (possibly) outdated.

For my use scenario, host system (Ubuntu Gnome) runs at full 1920x1080 resolution. Whonix Workstation under KVM runs in a 4:3 box in the center of the screen, even in fullscreen mode.

Is there an easy way to switch Workstation to occupying full landscape resolution of the screen, instead of showing vertical black bars on each side? There doesn&#39;t seem to be an intuitive way to do this from within system settings of Workstation, so guessing it involves something more obtuse.

EDIT: Found it here: https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,1454.msg9167.html#msg9167
