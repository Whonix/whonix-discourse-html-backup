    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/one-whonix-gateway-for-workstation-and-other-os/6465</link>
    <description>Hello, i have two whonix-gateway for one whonix-workstation and other for other OS
To switch between the workstation and the other OS&#39;s I always unplug the gateway one OS the OS and then turn on the gateway of another OS and the OS
I have a question, is it possible to have sufficient security to do restart Tor in the gateway when saved and closed os of it gateway and start other operating system
whether this option is safe?</description>
