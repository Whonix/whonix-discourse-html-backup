    <description>This is really becoming an issue for me... I have to continue to remove and add again the workstation to VB in hope that my desktop will appear.. 

So, i&#39;m running Debian 64 bit on my host and i&#39;ve installed vb and Whonix but when I start the machines, 9 times out of 10 my desktop and icons are not visible once they fully start. It still appears to be fully functional through terminal which is all i can pull up (though I havent done much) but this is very annoying and I cant find a resolution for it. Im new to whonix overall so I dont know anything very technical to fix it. Any suggestions or a out right fix????</description>

            <p>Try remove VBox guest additions:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>(As per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian.)">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian.)</a></p>
<p>Otherwise - for debugging purposes - forget about Whonix for a while. Try Debian in a VM. Wheezy (Whonix 10). Or forget about that and get Debian Jessie (Whonix 11 - to be released "soonish"I). See how Debian works. Any issues? If not, try installing guest additions.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>If it still works? Report back here. Otherwise, it’s a non-Whonix issue and you’re best off working with the Debian and/or VirtualBox support/communities getting this solved.</p>

            <p>Nope, nothing is accessible from desktop. I can still type in short cut commands like F2 for instance will still bring up konsole…I dont know what the problem is. Also, the scroll bar to the right is really small and I can move it up and down but its nothing but a blank desktop.</p>

            <p>No idea.</p>
<p>The start menu is still accessible?</p>
<p>What happens if you resize, un-maximize, maximize the VBox VM window? Does that fix it?</p>
