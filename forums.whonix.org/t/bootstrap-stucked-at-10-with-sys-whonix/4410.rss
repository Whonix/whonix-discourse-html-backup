    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/bootstrap-stucked-at-10-with-sys-whonix/4410</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m new to Qubes but I&#39;m used to virtualization and have already done some trial/error with qubes installation and also I&#39;ve red a lot about qubes and qubes networking so &quot;I should not&quot; be out of my depth here.

So for the first few trials I&#39;ve used sys-whonix as out of the box and it managed to connect me to Tor without any bridges configuration but of course I didn&#39;t get any long-term connectivity. First thing to say, is that I didn&#39;t find any documentation about how it was connecting by itself and in comparison with the need to configure some bridges for a more advanced configuration..... That I think is really a must to have for every average user, if anyone has that article on hand, could be great to link it?

Second, which is my real problem, I&#39;ve made my torrc user configuration as said in the tutorials with 3 obfs4 bridges. Since then I can&#39;t make the bootstrap working no more and so can&#39;t connect to Tor. It is stucked at 10% which seems to be the handshake with the first bridge right? 

For more details: 
1/the first batch for bridges that I took from the website was no good, one was unpingable. So I was guessing that was part of the problem. So I took another batch of bridges and the three here are pingable. 
2/ I didn&#39;t make any changes to sys-firewall, and even so, if I understand correctly, the whole concept is to block exiting connection, not incoming connections. So to my knowledge it would&#39;nt change a thing.
3/ Since it was working out of the box, I guess it&#39;s not my LAN configuration either ...
4/ the template is up to date I think . 0.2.9.10
5/ No date problem too. 

The whonixsetup is green so I guess there is no error in my torrc.
So I&#39;m a bit out of ideas here.
Are there bad batch of bridges and so you need to try a lot of them? 
Should I open a port in My LAN configuration? 
I guess I should&#39;nt say my country here, but to my knowledge there is no censorship here.... 

So what should I provide ? the status of the service is good and active  

Oct 07 00:23:09 host Tor[2752]: New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1.
Oct 07 00:23:09 host Tor[2752]: New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1.
Oct 07 00:23:20 host Tor[2752]: New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1.
Oct 07 00:23:20 host Tor[2752]: New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1.
Oct 07 00:23:30 host Tor[2752]: New control connection opened from 127.0.0.1.


I have a bit no clue here.... Should I try a third, forth or even fifth batch of bridges? 
Thanks in advance

            <p>So finally I had time and money to get some more equipment.<br>
I’ve installed whonix 13 and now whonix 14 under kvm under a fedora workstation 28.<br>
No problem with tor anymore. IT’s not very fast but that’s inherent to tor network.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/bill">@bill</a> I resolved, I think the problem, because of contacting ubiquiti support and they made some firmware update as you could see also I’m sure. The 1.10.5 seems to work.<br>
From their feedback, it seems that it was a bug in PPPOE since they experienced no problem at all when they were conencting through cable coax connection.<br>
The problem is not 100% resolved but at least it’s functionnal now.<br>
I’ve tested under the equipment Edgerouter ER8 PRO and ER6Poe. Maybe you can give us some feedback with ubiquiti edgerouter X?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just wanted to report in that I’m experiencing similar problems to the OP connecting to Tor. When researching the issue I came across this thread.</p>
<p>In Qubes 3.2 I had never had difficulty connecting to Tor from Whonix, until I switched my router from an old ASUS to this <strong>Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X</strong>.</p>
<p>I had followed the setup guide for the EdgeMax router here <a href="https://github.com/mjp66/Ubiquiti" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/mjp66/Ubiquiti</a><br>
and I was unsure if those particular steps had somehow caused the Ubiquiti to impede connections to Tor. However, like the OP, I can easily access Tor, without modifying the torrc, in Windows 7 and Windows 10 HVMs.</p>
<p>To get sys-whonix to connect to Tor I can sometimes find success by adding obfs4 bridges in torrc. I never had success with bridges obtained from the web. I was only able to get in with bridges obtained via e-mail. That worked flawlessly for several weeks, but now those bridges are failing as well and adding more bridges has only worked sporadically. Eventually the connection is lost (usually after being connected for about 10 minutes or so).</p>
<p>Following this thread I tried moving the sys-whonix from the default<br>
sys-whonix --&gt; sys-firewall --&gt; sys-net to<br>
sys-whonix --&gt; sys-net<br>
That seemed to work for a bit, but then eventually failed.</p>
<p>I can sometimes access Tor by switching between a torrc that contains 20+ obfs4 bridges, and a torrc that doesn’t use bridges at all. Sometimes I can do this by altering the torrc and using the sighup x command in Arm. Other times I restart Tor or restart sys-whonix completely.</p>
<p>I can run whonixcheck from the anon-whonix AppVM, but not from sys-whonix. From sys-whonix I recieve an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WARNING: Tor Check Result: Tor is disabled. Therefore you most likely can not connect to the internet.</p>
<p>(Debugging information: Could not find DisableNetwork 0 in /etc/tor/torrc.)</p>
<p>Please close this window and enable Tor using Whonix Setup!<br>
dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: sys-whonix -&gt; Whonix Setup<br>
or in Terminal: sudo whonixsetup</p>
<p>or manually (If you know about the public Tor network!) and open /etc/tor/torrc with root rights (dom0 -&gt; Start Menu -&gt; ServiceVM: sys-whonix -&gt; Torrc) and set:<br>
DisableNetwork 0<br>
Then run whonixcheck again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, torrc clearly has “DisableNetwork 0”</p>

            <p>so here are the capture which are encrypted for obviously reason. So the ones who really want to investigate and help through this can ask me the password.<br>
the names of the capture are normally enough to understand.<br>
So there is one from the wifi from the iphone accesspoint in 4G<br>
then there are 2 directly connected to a “by default” port on a ER5-POE (ubiquiti).<br>
The first try is in the continuity from the connection from the wifi so I restart Tor and then do a whonixcheck.<br>
The second try I completely shutdown the proxyvm and restart it with the command “sudo wireshark” and directly start the capture…<br>
Each try on the ER5-POE does have 2 whonixchecks.</p>
<p>the proxyvm is up to date by the way.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for all the help. I hope I didn’t let important information in the caputre but I can’t be sure so it would be very kind to anyone to let me know if I let things not supposed to be there.<br>
And I hope that nobody will abuse of it.</p>
<p>here the link to the capture it’s encoded with openssl aes 256<br>

            <p>So I’ve made some tests.<br>
It is not vlan related, nor the switches.<br>
I’ve tested on 2 different models of ubiquiti routers on default ports without any options activate, just default setup on those ports and it’s very likely that something in the firewall of ubiquiti drops packet or something which would be related to whonix but I don’t know why yet. So I will do some capture on the whonix proxyvm and see what it gives.</p>

            <p>I come back to you after some tests which I need to continue them to have a good general idea.<br>
I wanted to come back to you for something more specific about this bootstrapping problem.<br>
None of you have pointed out or reacted to one of my previous post.</p>
<p>The line where I got “server connection refused” and which I continue to get.</p>
<p>I would really want to clarify the situation about that to move forward with the problem. Don’t hesitate to correct me if one of you have already reacted on this.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m on  version 0.3.1.8 for the moment.</p>
<p>From my humble position, I can say with pretty much confidence that nothing is magical in computer science. So any error message have been programmed before. This error message is pretty clear and must have been provisioned in very precised events in the code.<br>
So first, where this message is coming from? Is there a if somewhere in the script of whonix where it is stated?<br>
Second, does someone know exactly why a node from Tor would launch such a signal? Since this error message is always linked to an address ip^which is not mine, which is not from my network or anything related to me.</p>
<p>So why am I asking that? Because after a few weeks of not using whonix in qubesos because of this problem, I 've tried it and put it up to date and for some hours it has worked more or less in a normal way and then suddenly it stopped working. That does tell me that there is actually no really incompatibilities between my setup or equipment with the tor nodes but for what ever reason, the Tor Nodes are communicating something about me, like a signature or something else and banned me from using it.  Because if not, this message would not have been created and if those were simply gateways where you want to do whatever you want with any equipment whatsoever,   this message would have no reasons to exists and be present in some code somewhere.<br>
So please someone, answer to those precise questions and be as specific as you can.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I think you should consider yourself lucky if you get a slow entry guard. What kind of honeypot operator would have constrained bandwidth and <em>chase away</em> users?</p>
<p>(If you run your own entry guard - Dingledine suggests doing this in one of his posts - does it need to be done anonymously?)</p>

<p>Good point. Hadn’t thought of that.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to rule that out for 2 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unless it’s been changed again, Tor still uses 2 entry guards (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9273">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9273</a>) so improbable but not impossible that both guards are bad/dead. Or maybe possible for 1st entry guard to prevent you from using fallback guard. Reason 2 is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OP has re-installed sys-whonix multiple times. (right <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/boistordu">@boistordu</a>?)</p>

<p>Dead entry guard will be replaced eventually.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>As Patrick said, best practice is one entry guard per ISP/network, so if you want to replace entry guard set, get a new network first. But this only solves fingerprint problem, still bad to unnecessarily expand guard set in terms of malicious guard exposure.</li>

<p>I understand the reasoning from a user’s point of view. But changing<br>
guards because they are not working is something we should actively<br>
discourage.</p>
<p>Because, perhaps the entry guards are legit, but an attacker slows them<br>
down so the user changes entry guards increasing chances to connect to<br>
malicious ones under the control of the attacker. Slowing down Tor so<br>
the user gives up on it is a known attack by adversaries. It’s an<br>
alternate strategy over fully blocking Tor.</p>
<p>What to do in these cases then? Change the network, use a user -&gt; tunnel<br>
-&gt; Tor connection and/or use bridges?</p>
<p>Could you document that please? <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/torjunkie">@torjunkie</a></p>

it’s an old lenovo t430 i5-3230M<br>
the 4G connection was through my Iphone so by wifi from my iphone to the laptop.<br>
the ethernet card is a intel 82579LM rev 04<br>
the wifi is a intel centrino advanced N6205</p>
<p>and wednesday I was someplace else by ethernet cable and the whonix gateway was working but did’nt try a lot so I could have been just lucky. I will try to test anyway more deeply like I said.</p>

</aside>
<p>If this wasn’t a privacy distribution, I wouldn’t bother taking one step forward with this issue without having your complete hardware configuration, including model numbers. But on this forum, we have to depend on users providing us all the relevant information while also not providing too much identifying information. In many cases, users don’t know what information is relevant.</p>
<p>So in your case, you have a laptop with 4g, wifi, and ethernet. Have you been using the same interface for all of your tests? including remote locations? If not, then that’s another variable that hasn’t been accounted for.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go someplace else. Use Ethernet. See if sys-whonix bootstraps properly.</li>
<li>Go home. Plug Ethernet directly to ISP. Bootstrap tor again.</li>
</ol>
<p>(“Use Ethernet” means disabling all other interfaces in sys-net so they don’t randomly connect while you are testing.)</p>
<p>That’s your base good working configuration. Now you can test different network components and different interfaces. It’s inefficient to test random configurations without having a simple baseline.</p>

            <p>of course thanks for the help patrick and every little piece of information you can give me will be welcomed. And of course I’m not discussing here the need to open or not ICMP packets, it’s jsut that as you well certainly know it’s maybe one of the first things you learn in any networking class to know how to debug a network.<br>
Anyway at some point, I will certainly use tcpdump and wireshark and test link by link to see where is the flaw, and that without touching the firewall at first, if at least there is no other protection than that and so that I can run both programs. It’s the only way that I know to see if packets are received and forwarded.</p>
<p>If I need to install  a package and have a connection I can always do that by connecting to my 4G so that’s okey on that part I won’t need normally to configre the template to be able to be directly connected through clearnet.</p>
<p>I will post any discoveries that I can make.</p>
