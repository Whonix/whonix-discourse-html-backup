    <title>certain company&#39;s will release your sim-card!!!</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/certain-companys-will-release-your-sim-card/2726</link>
    <description>according to this one youtuber https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caVEiitI2vg certain company&#39;s will release your sim-card if convinced enough,for example the attacker will act as a phone company employee and say he is in the store with a customer and will call t-mobile for your sim-card 

my question is,is there a privacy focused phone company? since it would not matter how secure or anonymous your OS  is if they get your sim card all the accounts connected to that phone via  2 step verification will be compromised</description>
