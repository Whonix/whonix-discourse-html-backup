    <title>NAX LSM Module for countering file-less malware attacks</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/nax-lsm-module-for-countering-file-less-malware-attacks/12447</link>
    <description>&gt; Due to the growing threat posed by file-less malware attacks where malware code is executed from anonymous executable memory pages that aren&#39;t backed by data on the file-system, the &quot;NAX&quot; Linux security module has been seeing work recently for helping to protect against such scenarios.

&gt; 
&gt; Typically, the malware first needs to intercept the execution flow (e.g.,
&gt; by the means of ROP-based exploit). Then it needs to download the main
&gt; part (in the form of normal executable or library) from its server,
&gt; because it is hard to implement the entire exploit in ROP-based form.
&gt; There are a number of security mechanisms that can ensure the integrity
&gt; of the file-system, but we need to ensure the integrity of the code in
&gt; memory too, to be sure, that only authorized code is running in the
&gt; system.
&gt; 
&gt; The proposed LSM is preventing the creation of anonymous executable pages
&gt; for the processes. The LSM intercepts mmap() and mprotect() system calls
&gt; and handles it similarly to SELinux handlers.
&gt; 
&gt; The module allows to block the violating system call or to kill the
&gt; violating process, depending on the settings, along with rate-limited
&gt; logging.
&gt; 
&gt; [JIT]
&gt; 
&gt; Because of blocked anonymous code execution, JIT-compiled code, some
&gt; interpreters (which are using JIT) and libffi-based projects can be
&gt; broken.
&gt; 
&gt; [Similar implementations]
&gt; 
&gt; Although SELinux could be used to enable similar functionality, this LSM
&gt; is simpler. It could be used in set-ups, where SELinux would be overkill.
&gt; 
&gt; There is also SARA LSM module, which solves similar task, but it is more
&gt; complex.
&gt; 
&gt; [Cooperation with other security mechanisms]
&gt; 
&gt; NAX LSM is more useful in conjunction with IMA. IMA would be responsible
&gt; for integrity checking of file-based executables and libraries, and
&gt; NAX LSM would be responsible for preventing of anonymous code execution.
&gt; 
&gt; Alternatively, NAX LSM can be used with read-only root file system,
&gt; protected by dm-verity/fs-verity.
