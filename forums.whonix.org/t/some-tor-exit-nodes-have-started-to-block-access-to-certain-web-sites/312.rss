    <description>I have come across this information and found confirmation of this. You cannot access some onion sites but after getting new Identity you can access those sites. It means that more and more exit nodes are run by adversaries performing censorship and moderation activities. Any recommendations?</description>

            <p>[quote=“nixx, post:5, topic:312”]Hidden service no longer work… YOu need to restart tor 10-20 times to make your hidden website or torchat working. It means that almost all  tor nodes are now captured by hostiles and they just block the onion addresses which they regard as threatening.<br>
Thus they blocked torbook recently. THus they block our resources as well. So Patrick perhaps now you must think about creating some OS based on vpn chains. That tor is becoming uselss. First they set up porn sites to spoil the dark web and now they went to their next phase i.e. technically implemented shadowbanning and blocking onion sites from running.[/quote]<br>
Your observation might be right. There might be a problem. But your conclusions do not follow.</p>

            <p>Also remember that anyone can run an exit node. So that anyone can route its exid node software via blocking filters, firewalls, etc limiting access to the sites he wants.</p>

            <p>Dear 1guest.</p>
<p>I have the same Problem like you. Adrelanos talks right. Some Kiddis forget LOIC and found Pyloris. This, the TBB and VidaliaStandAlone makes it possible. So, i think the Problem will continue.</p>

            <p>This could also just mean, that a relay is having technical difficulties or offline due to someone trying to ddos using the Tor network and therefore ddossing the Tor network itself. New identity results in using a different route, so that could explain why it works. Apart from that, there is nothing to suggest.</p>
<p>Generally, such issues are best discussed on the tor-talk mailing list, because Tor devs are reading it. They might be able to take counter measures, explain, etc.</p>
