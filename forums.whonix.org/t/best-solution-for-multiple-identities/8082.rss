    <title>Best solution for multiple identities?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/best-solution-for-multiple-identities/8082</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve read Multiple_Whonix-Workstation Multiple_Whonix-Gateway Dev/Multiple_Whonix-Workstation topics but its still unclear for me what is the best solution. As far as I understand, the main disadvantage of multi-WS/multi-GW 1:1 setup is that those GWs would have different bridges/guards and it might decrease security. However, it&#39;s fairly easy (at least for my mind) to make all GWs have the same bridges/guards settings, so I guess this problem can be solved. After that, this setup must have no clear disadvantages (except slightly decreased performance). 

The questions: Is it correct? Do I miss something?</description>
