<p>Dunno what you are referring to, but systemd in Debian main is 100% open source. Anything else would be against Debian policy.</p>

Both yes.

Bricking is a risk. Libre Software BIOS is difficult.
See also http://me.bios.io/Main_Page and http://www.coreboot.org/.
<p>There is also some Libre Software hardware, but I am not much into that topic.</p>

<p>Even if I’m barely literate in bash, it would reassure me that so many hairy, cantankerous sysadmins can understand sysinit. I’m less trustful of people in suits, or uniforms.</p>

<p>I also note that Qubes is based on Fedora (Red Hat’s distro): <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://groups.google.com/forum/</a>?<em>escaped_fragment</em>=topic/qubes-devel/6UeRE6fM-cI#!topic/qubes-devel/6UeRE6fM-cI  I wonder why they chose that distro?</p>

            <p>Dear z!</p>
<p>This Links are well known long time, probably i think Month ago. So, Julian never says that Debian owned by NSA. This Articles are a blah blah blah and nothing else. At present Time, the NSA and CIA uses 4000 Vulnerabilities every Day in Programms, OSs, Tools and much more. Well, build up your own Opionion and don’t believe the PIPE!</p>
