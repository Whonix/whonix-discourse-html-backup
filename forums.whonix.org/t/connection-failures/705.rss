    <title>Connection failures</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/connection-failures/705</link>
    <description>Very often a tor connection is dying. Web pages in Workstations TBB stop loading, arm monitor in Gateway shows no traffic, and when I test connection in Gateway, it is also dead, but show no errors.. 

Sometimes the connection outage takes 30 or 60 seconds and then it recovers, sometimes it dies absolutely, so I have to restart Workstation and Gateway. But after that, connection dropping out again and again. 

Is it problem with Tor network? When I go to my host system and test connection, it works fine.

When a I was on Whonix 8, I dont remember such problems. Thanks.</description>

            <p>I have not noticed any recent deterioration in the quality or duration of Tor connections, which seem quite satisfactory. Admittedly, that’s from a non-Whonix desktop since that’s where I use Tor every day.</p>

            <p>My evening: First start of whonix, connection was dead from beginning, writes two messages “Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:433. Giving up. (waiting for circuit)”</p>
<p>I restarted Workst and Gateway, first 4 minutes connection was good and fast, but suddenly died.<br>
Now its my third try, Im writing this reply feared whether it dies again or not.</p>
<p>Ran some internet speedtests on host and seems to be good there.</p>

            <p>Strange, that I have not found other users complaining on the same issue.<br>
I connect through VPN on my host system. Maybe some micro-failures in connection on my host can cause long time connection failures in whonix. But everytime when traffic in Whonix was dead, internet in host worked.</p>

            <p>Recent versions of Tor use only 1 entry guard. If it’s not that good, that could be the cause.</p>
