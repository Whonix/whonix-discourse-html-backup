    <description>hey there this is my first post here 
i&#39;ve read the documentation and i have some questions

so i plan too use win7 as host and virtual box for whonix
on win7 host i have disabled all networking so deleted all ethernet and wireless drivers and for whonix connection i will use alfa adapter which does not have installed drivers on win7 host
so if there is some exploit in virtualbox and malware does break out somehow it will have no networking in the host so ip and location are still hidden? is this right?

if i want to use win7 or xp machine for whonix workstation and i use torbrowser to blend in with the crowd how can i avoid having tor over tor situation that can be dangerous?

is disabling transport advised if i use the setup as above?

if i run tor buddy script(http://learnnetsec.blogspot.com/2013/06/tor-buddy-live.html) on whonix gateway to change the tunnel more frequent then 10 minutes is it gonna add more anonimity ?

if using pptp vpn to connect workstation to gateway does the ISP still see i am using TOR and can the exit node sniff my packets? i mean is something like https://blog.malwarebytes.org/development/2012/04/anonymizing-traffic-for-your-vm-and-capturing-traffic/ possible with using whonix gateway ofcourse?</description>

            <p>so the best bet with custom workstations to prevent tor over tor is to leave at default tor settings that will be forwarded from the workstation to gateway<br>
did i get it right??</p>

<p>Generally, the argument against using WiFi is, that any adversary that has compromised the host (which means has also access to Whonix-Gateway) can use the WiFi to jump onto any other WiFi network.</p>
<p>I still don’t get what it buys you. There is still a way to connect to clearnet - how else could Whonix-Gateway possibly connect. An adversary who possess skills to break out the host can also easily break into Whonix-Gateway from there and then reconfigure Whonix-Gateway to connect to any cleanet targets the adversary wishes.</p>

            <p>That’s an interesting idea. But futile, I think.</p>
<p>If the host has no internet connectivity, how could Whonix-Gateway have? And if the host has none, but somehow Whonix-Gateway, an adversary who broke out to the host could then easily infect Whonix-Gateway as well. I would assume that an adversary in position to break out of VirtualBox has the chance to pull this off as well.</p>

No, because then you're the one who changes more frequently than vast majority of others and you don't want to stand out.
<blockquote>if using pptp vpn to connect workstation to gateway does the ISP still see i am using TOR and can the exit node sniff my packets?</blockquote>
Both, yes.
<p>There are very few use cases where it makes sense to run a VPN server on the same machine as the client. For what you have in mind here, it certainly won’t help.</p>
<blockquote>i mean is something like https://blog.malwarebytes.org/development/2012/04/anonymizing-traffic-for-your-vm-and-capturing-traffic/ possible with using whonix gateway ofcourse?</blockquote>
Possibly useful VPN / tunnel scenarios are documented here:
