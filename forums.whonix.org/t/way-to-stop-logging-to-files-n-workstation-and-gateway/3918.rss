    <title>Way to stop logging to files n Workstation and Gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/way-to-stop-logging-to-files-n-workstation-and-gateway/3918</link>
    <description>Is there a way to disable logging to files such as syslog, kern.log and messages? 

As per Linux help on the web, I tried a process where the first step is stopping the log deamon, but the command &quot;sudo stop deamon&quot; failed with stop command not found.</description>
