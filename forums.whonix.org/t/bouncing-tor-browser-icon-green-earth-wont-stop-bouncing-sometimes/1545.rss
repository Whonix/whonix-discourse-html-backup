    <title>Bouncing Tor Browser icon (green earth) won&#39;t stop bouncing sometimes?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/bouncing-tor-browser-icon-green-earth-wont-stop-bouncing-sometimes/1545</link>
    <description>I noticed that when I open an app on the workstation that the app will have a smaller icon bounce once or twice then stop bouncing when the app is open.  However, with the tor browser sometimes the green earth tor logo will keep bouncing through my entire Internet session and won&#39;t stop until I restart the gateway.  Then other times it won&#39;t bounce at all.  I am easily spooked due to lack of knowledge so I have been restarting workstation when this happens.  Just curious if it happens to anyone else and what it could mean?  Why does it happen some times and not others?

Thanks</description>

            <p>So there must be something wrong with the existing desktop icon. The one<br>
on the desktop, I suppose? Just delete it and create a new one.</p>

            <p>Can you check please, that your shortcut leads to <code>/usr/share/applications/anondist-torbrowser.desktop</code> or <code>/usr/share/applications/janondisttorbrowser.desktop</code>? I think it could just be a stale shortcut. Otherwise please try going to <code>/usr/share/applications/</code> and starting <code>anondist-torbrowser.desktop</code> manually.

            <p>Unrelated to security. I haven’t heard this before. Usually launch feedback stops after one minute or so. I don’t think it’s related to being online or offline. I don’t think it would affect if Whonix-Gateway is started or not.</p>

            <p>No my whonix is up to date as far as  Whonix Build Version: 11.0.0.3.0.  I know whatever app I open will bounce a few times and then stop.  The only one that won’t stop bouncing is the Tor app.  It will continue bouncing the entire time I am online.  It gets annoying so I restart the workstation and it goes away.  Does this happen to anyone else??</p>

            <p>Old version of Whonix? What Whonix version are you using?</p>
<p>It’s called KDE launch feedback. KDE makes the icon bounce as long as it got feedback from the application that it finished launching.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>wait a minute, so restarting the gateway, stop the “bouncing” inside the workstation? Or did you mean restarting the workstation, because that would make far more sense.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed that when I open an app on the workstation that the app will have a smaller icon bounce once or twice then stop bouncing when the app is open.  However, with the tor browser sometimes the green earth tor logo will keep bouncing through my entire Internet session and won’t stop until I restart the gateway.  Then other times it won’t bounce at all.  I am easily spooked due to lack of knowledge so I have been restarting workstation when this happens.  Just curious if it happens to anyone else and what it could mean?  Why does it happen some times and not others?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
