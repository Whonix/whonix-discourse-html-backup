    <title>How to uninstall Guest Additions?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-uninstall-guest-additions/373</link>
    <description>Good Evening!
First of all i want to thank all the people who are constantly working on Whonix  and for  making it free and open for everyone to use!

I just started using Whonix and kicked off by copying and applying my tor config in the Gateway machine.
To do that i had to install the Guest Additions first.
Now my Problem is, that i am not able to uninstall them.
When i try to rightclick and press eject in Dolphin file manager i get the following error message: 

&quot;The requested operation has failed.: Error starting job: Failed to execute child process &quot;eject&quot; (No such file or directory).&quot;

I know that the Guest Additions are mounted, because i can still change the resolution by draggging the window larger or smaller.

I still have a few general questions regarding the Guest Additions.

I have already read  that installing the Guest Additions is considered to be a Security risk.

Is that so because one could enable options like a shared folder or shared clipboard which would make it easier for an attacker to reach the host system?
Is the installation of the Guest Additions still a risk if you have all those options disabled and only use the Additions for  higher resolution options they offer?

kind regards,

            <p>To uninstall them… If you installed them using these instructions (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions</a>) using the package manager apt-get, you can uninstall them using the package manager apt-get.</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-x11
sudo apt-get autoremove</code></p>
<p>Then reboot. That’s all.</p>

<blockquote>"The requested operation has failed.: Error starting job: Failed to execute child process "eject" (No such file or directory)."</blockquote>
Probably unrelated.
<blockquote>Is that so because one could enable options like a shared folder or shared clipboard which would make it easier for an attacker to reach the host system?</blockquote>
No.
<blockquote>Is the installation of the Guest Additions still a risk if you have all those options disabled and only use the Additions for  higher resolution options they offer?</blockquote>
Yes. (In theory because they're extra drivers, which weaken isolation between host/guest.)
