            <p>I am experiencing this too… it seems to only happen on Whonix 15 (I could still get it to work on 14 until recently)  Whenever I click on the button to open certain menus (add new chat partner, create new group, etc) the entire window gets a grey tint, but the menu doesn’t pop up.  Has anyone else experienced this issue?  If so, have you been able to get around it somehow?</p>
