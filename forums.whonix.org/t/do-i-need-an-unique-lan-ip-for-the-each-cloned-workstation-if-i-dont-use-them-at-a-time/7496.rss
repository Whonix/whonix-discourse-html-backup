    <title>Do I need an unique LAN IP for the each cloned Workstation if I don&#39;t use them at a time?</title>

    <description>I have a one Gateway and several cloned Workstations in my VirtualBox.

In this article /wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstation (section Non-Qubes-Whonix) I see the following warning:

&gt; Each additional Whonix-Workstation ™ VM must have its own MAC address and internal LAN IP address.

I already have unique MAC addresses for the each Workstations (VirtualBox network settings). But what about unique internal LAN IPs?

Is it important only in case of using multiple Workstations at a time? Or I also have to do this if I use my Workstations separately in different time?

Thanks!</description>

<p>Required. Must be done manually because there’s no DHCP  on the GW for security reasons.</p>
