    <title>Uninstalled vlc, completely broke whonix, can I recover?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/uninstalled-vlc-completely-broke-whonix-can-i-recover/2757</link>
    <description>Hello,

I was using whonix 12  on virtualbox on my Ubuntu 14.04 (didn&#39;t even know there was whonix 13, I stopped reading the welcome message because it looks the same each time). I couldn&#39;t log onto skype so I updated and upgraded everything with apt-get update, upgrade.
I do&#39;nt think it updated to whonix 13 but it took a while.

I saw it updated vlc so I removed it because I don&#39;t want it. Then I saw tons of package needing to be uninstalled but I didn&#39;t bother because whonix is hard to understand, then I hit &quot;yes, remove all these packages&quot; and now I have no desktop anymore and I suppose I broke it in depth. When I connect I have a black shell asking my credentials.

I did the same stupid thing on both workstation and gateway.

1. Is there a way to recover whonix? I had some &quot;important data&quot; there.
2. If I upgrade to whonix 13, would it repair itself?</description>

            <p>Oh ok I get it now, thanks. I never used KDE before (but got some troubles installing KDE based programs on gnome though :D). From your last message, I didn’t use your commands since my whonix is broken. And partially because everything you said is unknown to me.</p>
<p>And to Ego, I used apt-get, not aptitude. I never used aptitude because as you said, I don’t know the difference and I never needed it <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Correct. VLC is not <strong>directly</strong> essential to Whonix but it <strong>is essential</strong> to things that are essential to Whonix. If you re-read my previous post, you can use those commands to find out <strong>exactly</strong> why uninstalling vlc broke your system. Actually, I already did that for you in my post. The culprit is a package called <code>phonon</code>, which depends on phonon-backend-vlc, which depends on vlc. If you uninstall vlc, you have to uninstall phonon as well. If you don’t know what phonon is, click here: <a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/phonon">https://packages.debian.org/jessie/phonon</a></p>
<p>As you can see, if you uninstall vlc in <strong>any linux distribution</strong> that uses KDE and its multimedia functions, you will break your system. So there is no contradiction with your comment below:</p>

            <p>The full message is similar to this one (just package list differs):</p>

<p>Debian is already quite clear on that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are about to do something potentially harmful.<br>
To continue type in the phrase ‘Yes, do as I say!’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do not read the what is being said, generally you will run into grave issues in security.</p>
<p>Often Whonix is limited to whatever its Debian base comes with. Perhaps Debian could write that in red color, perhaps then that message would be taken serious a bit more often.</p>

</aside>
<p>You probably don’t know the difference between apt-get remove/purge and aptitude remove/purge.</p>
<p>The first one (which you presumably used on Ubuntu) only removes the program in question and, if purge is used, also its configuration. The latter though (presumably used on Whonix) removes the program (in this case VLC) and ANYTHING this program depends on. This can and often will include quite crucial parts to the systems integrity. More on the differences can be read here (even though this is askubuntu, the same goes for any OS implementing APT): <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/187891">http://askubuntu.com/a/187891</a></p>
<p>Obviously, VLC isn’t essential. Some “stuff” used by it, is though. And using the wrong command to uninstall the program (apt-get vs aptitude) can lead to such problems. That is, why it is always important to double-check what you’ve typed and not blindly accept any question the OS asks you with yes, before reading and understanding it completely.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>VLC is not essential to the OS, right?</p>
<p>I removed and installed tons of packages. I wasn’t paying enough attention because of how safe it is usually (i didn’t read the package names, just saw like 50 and thought it was unusual but since Whonix is not ubuntu, I thought ‘ok np’). <strong>It’s my fault</strong> but still, you can’t say VLC is an essential package for the system. It’s the first time I remove a non-essential program like this to find out it has dependencies that mustn’t be removed.</p>
<p>On my ubuntu I installed and removed VLC and nothing got broken if my memory serves me right.</p>
<p>I’m going to pay more attention but mainly on whonix because on other OS, never had this kind of problem during 3 years of linux.</p>
<p>PS: can’t login on my vbox (not surprising) and I don’t think I can easily recover files haha (T_T)</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Actually the same goes for other operating systems like Debian. If you remove certain essential packages/dependencies, you remove essential parts for the system to run. These were, like <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> wrote,  Debian packages by the way. This thus isn’t a problem specific to Whonix.</p>
<p>Also, a warning was mentioned. Every package depending on the one you wanted to remove was laid out.</p>
<p>And again, the same goes for other distributions based on Debian. Removing something whose necessity you don’t grasp for the simple reason that the underlying software is complex is never a good idea and can lead to sever stability and security issues.</p>
<p>I’d recommend freshly installing your Workstation.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>I read the wiki and seriously, it’s not clear. I think that’s one thing that should be reworked on the whonix project.</p>
<p>I am used to debian 7 and ubuntu and I never thought uninstalling a subpar program would uninstall everything on whonix. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Maybe there should be a specific warning? Or a small part talking about this in a tutorial during first install?</p>

<p>my reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always experiment on Cloned VMs, preferably off-line. (Qubes-only) For Whonix-GW, make sure no VMs are associated with it - no child VMs (if template), no upstream VMs (if proxyVM).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant documentation (including links to package lists): <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Debian_Packages#Why_is_package_X_installed.3F">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Debian_Packages#Why_is_package_X_installed.3F</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure it out yourself using apt-cache rdepends. Try <code>sudo apt-cache --recursive rdepends vlc</code> and you’ll see just how many packages rely on vlc at some level. Doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t be removed but you’ll have broken dependencies unless everything in that list is removed also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel free to ask here: <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/more-unwanted-packages/2155">more unwanted packages</a> (I would answer here but I don’t know.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the <code>--installed</code> option to only see packages installed on your system (and work backwards) so:<br>
<code>sudo apt-cache --installed rdepends vlc</code><br>
<code>sudo apt-cache --installed rdepends phonon-backend-vlc</code><br>
<code>sudo apt-cache --installed rdepends phonon</code><br>

<p>Don’t know about recovering Whonix. But the disk image is not encrypted (by default) so you should be able to mount it in another VM and recover files. (Not a whonix-specific issue.)</p>
