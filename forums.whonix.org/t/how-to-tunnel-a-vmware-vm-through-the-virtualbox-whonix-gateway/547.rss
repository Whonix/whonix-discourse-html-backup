    <title>How to tunnel a vmware VM through the virtualbox whonix-gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-tunnel-a-vmware-vm-through-the-virtualbox-whonix-gateway/547</link>
    <description>hey guys, I have the gateway and workstation working great in virtualbox.  however, I have another VM that is running another linux distro, but it is in VMware.  Is there an easy way to bridge this vm into the virtualbox &quot;internal network&quot; ?  I have read the docs on setting up another GNU/Linux distro, but that is placing the distro inside of a virtualbox VM, not vmware.

I have tried a lot of different combinations, like binding on a 3rd network interface to the host-only port and then bridging in the vmware through that device, but I havent been able to get any internet connectivity....


Unrelated, I recently upgraded Whonix from 8 -&gt; 9, and (as per the upgrade docs), I keep having to run &quot;sudo service msgcollector restart&quot; in order for whonixcheck to work.  Is there anyway to get this automated at boot up?</description>

            <p>I personally wouldn’t mix them up. With such experiments you increase the likelihood of messing up something.</p>
<p>Likely you will have a hard time finding people who did that. However, the Whonix specificness of that question is limited. Also as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a> if you really want to do this, I recommend to learn first how to do something similar without involving Whonix. If you figured out, add Whonix to the mix.</p>
<p>Not a big fan of VMware anyhow:<br>

Please post a separate topic. That's a bug we should diagnose and fix.
