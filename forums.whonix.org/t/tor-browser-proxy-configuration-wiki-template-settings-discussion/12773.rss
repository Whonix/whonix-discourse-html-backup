    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Long Wiki Edits Thread](https://forums.whonix.org/t/long-wiki-edits-thread/3477/1475):

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:TorBrowser_Proxy_Configuration

Old version: https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Template:TorBrowser_Proxy_Configuration&amp;oldid=65909

&gt; This process can be repeated with socks proxies, but it is redundant and does not provide any advantage over the former types. The reason is because only Tor Browser is modified and no other programs are being tunneled through it.

I don&#39;t understand this.

Based on https://forums.whonix.org/t/cannot-add-socks-proxy-to-tor-browser/12728/3 these instructions have been improved just now.

&gt; This process can be repeated with socks proxies, but it is redundant and does not provide any advantage over the former types. The reason is because only Tor Browser is modified and no other programs are being tunneled through it.

&gt; repeated

This implies setting HTTP + HTTPS + SOCKS proxy settings?

Would someone wanting to configure a HTTPS proxy leave HTTP settings empty?

That seems application specific and there could be leak bugs in Firefox depending on the configuration.

&gt; socks ... does not provide any advantage over the former types. 

Feature wise, clearly according to [Comparison Tables](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services#Comparison_Tables_2) socks4a and socks5 are better.

We already cover that in [Proxy Warning](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy#Proxy_Warning) somewhat but perhaps a clear recommendation (despite all the warnings beforehand on remote proxies generally) &quot;use socks5&quot; should be spelled out?

&gt; * Apply the following steps to avoid unexpected results such as broken connectivity and/or traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and only going through Tor.

To avoid traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and only going through Tor... Wouldn&#39;t it be best to trust Tor Browser&#39;s default settings and make only minimal modifications?

Tor Browser&#39;s default settings are...

&gt; network.proxy.socks	file:///run/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/127.0.0.1_9150.sock	
&gt; network.proxy.socks_port	0	
&gt; network.proxy.socks_remote_dns	true	
&gt; network.proxy.socks_version	5

network.proxy.socks is modified in Whonix through use of an environment variable -&gt; https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor

From that perspective the most minimal change would be to use socks5 + modify `network.proxy.socks` + `network.proxy.socks_port` only.

Is

&gt; **5.** Set `network.proxy.no_proxies_on` to `0`.

still required or would it still be required?
