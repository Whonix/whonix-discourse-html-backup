    <title>Whonix doesn&#39;t run on an encrypted flash drive</title>

    <description>Good afternoon. I appeal to you, because I could not find the correct answer. On the encrypted flash drive installed Debian 9, which works quite correctly. But as I run Virtualbox with Whonix, I/o error is constantly issued, sometimes immediately, sometimes after working for some time. Put debian on a hard drive, there were no problems with Whonix. I assume that the problem with the flash drive. Just do not know how to decide with any settings, or the choice of another flash drive. Thank you for your help.</description>

            <p>Hi <code>ekstorm9545</code></p>
<p>Are you using a hardware encrypted drive or luks?  You should use luks FDE.</p>
