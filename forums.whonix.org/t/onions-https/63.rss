    <description>hi,

I&#39;m currently having a hard time wrapping my head around Tor hidden services (onions), i.e. the Tor Rendezvous protocol + HTTPS. That is to say, while browsing the dark web (who came up with this silly name anyways?), I came across several websites/hidden services with a (self-signed) SSL certificate. Isn&#39;t this total non-sense or is it me missing the point here?

I mean HTTPS serves two purposes:
1. providing end-to-end encryption
2. ensuring the authenticity of the content provider

Now, to my understanding onions provide both of these by design. The connection is end-to-end encrypted (it never leaves the Tor network and, as a result, even protects against exit-node eavesdropping) + without possessing the private key, the content provider couldn&#39;t provide the hidden service after all. So, basically, attaching a SSL certificate to a hidden service currently doesn&#39;t make any sense at all to me and I&#39;m looking forward to some discussion ... or even better: please prove me wrong that I can learn something.

thanks!</description>

            <p>Looks like they are using padding and cover traffic as synonyms.</p>
<p>SSL encrypts end-to-end (browser to server), .onion encrypts Tor to Tor.</p>

            <p>end-to-end encryption? HTTPS provides that?how interesting I thought only cover traffic could provide end to end encryption if you don’t know what I mean by cover traffic this is what I mean <a href="http://imgur.com/hj7K3eo" rel="nofollow noopener">http://imgur.com/hj7K3eo</a></p>

<p>Anonymously host any server with Whonix ™ and Tor onion services</p>

<p>Few points to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra layer of encryption, when .onion encryption can be broken, SSL encryption might still be safe. (It doesn’t come without disadvantages. We could also argue about attack surface, performance, etc.)</li>
<li>SSL uses stronger encryption than current .onion</li>
<li>.onion is not really encrypted end-to-end, but Tor-to-Tor. When the server setup involves forwarding connections from the Tor client to a load balancer and/or other servers, SSL can still make sense.</li>
</ul>
