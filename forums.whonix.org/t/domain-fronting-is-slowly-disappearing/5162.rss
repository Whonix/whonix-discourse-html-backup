    <description>This is going to affect the meek / meek-lite users, including those in Whonix 14:

https://blog.torproject.org/domain-fronting-critical-open-web

&gt; In the past few weeks, Amazon and Google have both announced they’re pulling the plug on domain fronting, a crucial tool which helps our most vulnerable users get access to Tor when their countries don’t allow it. Users of Signal and Telegram are also affected by this block, and Access Now identified approximately a dozen “human rights-enabling technologies” which had relied on Google for this purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; Google and Amazon have both shut down domain fronting, making meek no longer usable over those CDNs. As of this writing, Microsoft’s Azure cloud still seems to be working with meek.
&gt; 
&gt; For the time being, we are shifting to Microsoft’s Azure cloud. But we’ve heard that option will soon be shut down, as well.

Obviously Amazon&#39;s balls getting squeezed in recent times and the general hostility of both companies to privacy are key factors at play here. Do you see them running Tor relays? Apparently no spare change for defending human rights.</description>

<p>I just realize this may never happen. <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/papers/thesis/#sec:meek-history-2015">Cloudflare stopped domain fronting since 2015</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As further fallout, Cloudflare, a CDN which Lantern used for fronting and whose CEO was quoted in the article, stopped supporting domain fronting [155], by beginning to enforce a match between the SNI and the Host header</p>

            <p>Well there is azure and hopefully a cloudflare instance. Interesting coincidence how both companies decided to do the same changes to their networks at the same time huh <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
