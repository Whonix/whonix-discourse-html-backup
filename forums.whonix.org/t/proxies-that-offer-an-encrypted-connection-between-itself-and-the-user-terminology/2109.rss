    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Persistent Tor Entry Guard Relays can make you trackable Across Different Physical Locations](https://forums.whonix.org/t/persistent-tor-entry-guard-relays-can-make-you-trackable-across-different-physical-locations/2090/12):

To Patrick

&gt; We are not aware of any http(s) or socks4(a)/5 proxies that offer an encrypted connection between itself and the user.

That is exactly what I would like to discuss with you! I mean, as far as I see, a lot of proxies/VPNs are &#39;user-to-proxy encrypted&#39;. And please let me introduce some of them:	1. VPNGate: http://www.vpngate.net/en/	2. Psiphon3: https://www.psiphon3.com/en/open-source.html	3. ShadowSocks: https://github.com/Long-live-shadowsocks/shadowsocks	4. Lantern: https://github.com/getlantern/lantern
[/quote]

That statement comes from the following page:

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services

I see, that statement needs some refinement.

* &quot;We are not aware of any http(s) or socks4(a)/5 proxies that offer an encrypted connection between itself and the user.&quot; - Strictly speaking this is true. And this matters if http(s) or socks4(a)/5 runs on remote locations.
* There are however local clients that suggest using http(s) or socks4(a)/5 as local interface. Such clients include Tor, i2p, JonDo, others and perhaps also some of the ones you pointed out.
* Not sure we should call those still &quot;proxy&quot;? That term is over used. Can we somehow distinguish simple remote http(s) or socks4(a)/5 proxies and those using that as local interface only and then use custom encrypted transports?

<p>Thank you for helping me to learn more, sir.<br>
I agree that we should distinguish them <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
