    <title>Most Onions Down due to a Denial of Service Attack on the Tor Network</title>

    <description>Since yesterday due to a denial of service (DOS) on the Tor network most onions where down.

Most sdwdate onion time sources and SecureDrop onions didn&#39;t work for me. The following references mention onion v3 only but most onions either v2 or v3 where inaccessible for me.

Quote Roger:
&gt; 
&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; The overload bugs on the directory authorities are continuing, but they
&gt; also continue to be mostly manageable.
&gt; 
&gt; But today, we spent several consensus intervals in a row without making
&gt; a consensus -- which is supposed to be fine because Tor clients can do
&gt; fine so long as they have a consensus from within the last 24 hours,
&gt; but it exposed a bug in the v3 onion service implementation, where v3
&gt; onion clients and v3 onion services choose not to even attempt to fetch
&gt; or publish v3 onion descriptors:
&gt; 
&gt; Jan 10 11:32:24.364 [warn] No live consensus so we can&#39;t get the
&gt; responsible hidden service directories.
&gt; 
&gt; The fix imo is that we need to make v3 onion services work under the
&gt; same time assumptions as the other parts of Tor -- if you have a usable
&gt; consensus, then use it.
&gt; 
&gt; I&#39;ve opened this ticket for the network team:
&gt; https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237
&gt; 
&gt; --Roger

There also lots of reports by other users elsewhere on the internet on this issue of onion connectivity being broken generally.

Since [sdwdate](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sdwdate) relies on Tor consensus ([Tor Consensus Time Sanity Check](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sdwdate#Tor_Consensus_Time_Sanity_Check)) and fetches time from onions it can no longer fetch and update the system time.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>o Major bugfixes (onion service v3):<br>
- Stop requiring a live consensus for v3 clients and services, and<br>
allow a “reasonably live” consensus instead. This allows v3 onion<br>
services to work even if the authorities fail to generate a<br>
consensus for more than 2 hours in a row. Fixes bug 40237; bugfix<br>
on 0.3.5.1-alpha.</p>
