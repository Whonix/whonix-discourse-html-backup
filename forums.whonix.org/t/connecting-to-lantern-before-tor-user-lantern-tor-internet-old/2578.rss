    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Connecting to JonDonym before Tor (User -&amp;gt; JonDonym -&amp;gt; Tor -&amp;gt; Internet)](https://forums.whonix.org/t/connecting-to-jondonym-before-tor-user-jondonym-tor-internet/2555/4):

I&#39;m really thrilled to see this post since I&#39;m trying to do a similar work these days and you offers a lot of  helpful information!

What I&#39;m doing can be called &quot;Connecting to Lantern before Tor (User -&gt;  Lantern -&gt; Tor -&gt; Internet) on qubes-whonix&quot;. And I believe the implement of that is very important for people in Tor-censored area, especially China, who use Whonix, because:
	1. Sadly, Tor Bridges and all kinds of Pluggable Transports provided by Tor project are no longer useful for people to circumvent the Internet censorship in China;
	2. OpenVPN which do have a introduction in Qubes Doc is completely censored by the GFW, so it is also impossible to use it to circumvent censorship. And I&#39;m not aware of any reliable VPN to do that job (Of course there&#39;re some VPN working in China but it is very likely they are all under the control and surveillance of CCP);
	3. Lantern (https://github.com/getlantern/lantern) is one of the two effective tools on linux to cirvmvent the censorship;
	4. Another one is called Shadowsocks (https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-qt5/wiki/Installation), however, it relys on a VPS builed by the user themselves, so it is a little bit hard to use by normal people;
	5. It is hard and extremely time-consuming for individuals to install lantern in VM themselves.

Apart from the most significant advantage that lantern makes Whonix useable in China, as far as I know, there&#39;re some other benefit to use lantern before Tor which may also apply to use JonDonym before Tor (correct me if I&#39;m wrong):
	1. The behavior Tor performs when connecting to Tor network is very unique so that it is very easy for ISP-level adversaries to know the fact you&#39;re using Tor network; By using Lantern/ JonDonym to hid the fact you&#39;re using Tor, one can mitigate the risk of correlation-attack;
	2.  One(or more in JonDonym) more public hops might be more difficult for a adversary to perform a trace-back attack?

Personally I prefer the idea that using Lantern is a separated ProxyVM because lantern is still in beta version and once it&#39;s compromised, it is able to gain the traffic data which hasn&#39;t been encrypted by Tor client yet if we installed it in the sys-whonix.




I&#39;ve been using Lantern before Tor in a vbox-based Whonix. The way I implement it can be found in https://forums.whonix.org/t/thats-how-i-circumvent-tor-sensorship-in-china/2312. (And a more detailed version, but in chinese, can be found in my blog: 
https://2xiangzi.blogspot.com/2016/05/whonix1.html
) However, I do meet some problem when doing it on Qubes-whonix which you guys may be able to help:

I installed lantern in a separate ProxyVM behind sys-whonix.

I make Lantern listen on all interfaces by using Privoxy:
listen-address: 0.0.0.0:8118
Forward / 127.0.0.1:8787

But then I run &#39;netstat&#39;, only to find &quot;127.0.0.1:Privoxy&quot; instead of &quot;0.0.0.0:privoxy&quot;.

Although it can successfully ping the IP of the ProxyVM in sys-whonix, the port ProxyIP:8118 is unreachable. I&#39;ve set the firewall of ProxyVM allow all connects but it doesn&#39;t help:(

Anyone have any suggestions please?</description>

<p>I agree with you that we have to assume every circumvention technique/tool have a short life since to some extent, their lives depend on the technique used by GFW.

</aside>
<p>In my opinion, based on my observation, although whonix is a great project, it is less likely to be “cared” by CCP in near future. That’s because, due to the limitation on money/manpower, they can only focus on those “high-value” “easy-to-catch” target(ex. the author of Shadowsocks who developed a very popular censorship circumvent tool without doing any anonymous protection ). So don’t worry too much:)</p>
<p>By the way, even if whonix project was under pressure, we shouldn’t do self-censorship , should we?<img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Using lantern behind Tor to avoid recaptcha may no longer be a good idea since recaptcha has appeared on at least google site when using lantern.</p>
<p>I’m curious about how you implement using Lantern behind Tor? A way to do this is using Privoxy:<br>
forward-socks5t  /  127.0.0.1:Tor 127.0.0.1:Lantern(8787 by default)</p>

            <p>Whonix should definitely cater to Chinese users seeking internet freedom - that’s what this project is all about. Unfortunately learning Chinese doesn’t happen overnight so your translation efforts are much appreciated. I do worry that Whonix devs might get some additional unwanted attention from MSS - and they may not play by the same rules as US/European agencies (whatever those may be).</p>
<p>Just had a lengthy <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-entry-guard-persistence-assumptions/2559/18">discussion about entry guards</a> so I have a handy quote about this:</p>

</aside>
<p>Here’s what arma (Roger Dingledine) <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters">wrote</a> about that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our best bet would be to use an anonymity system to reach Tor – but even then whatever remains as the equivalent of the first hop would still need something like entry guards, assuming we’re aiming for a system that scales to millions of people and doesn’t involve having each user set up ‘trusted’ infrastructure (whatever trusted would even mean on this fine Internet we have).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, it <strong>is</strong> a good idea to use another anonymity system with Tor <strong>if</strong> those entry guards are not monitored along with your current exit points. We don’t know how many Tor or JonDo Entries are evil or whether or not separate anonymity networks are cross-correlated with each other. (I don’t know anything about JonDo but it might be easier to control a larger portion of their Entries - legally, or otherwise).</p>

<p>Not sure if this is what you meant, but FYI, using the Firewall settings in Qubes GUI affects the iptables of the netVM that the machine is connected to, not the machine itself. Example: if you have:<br>

<li>sys-net has no firewall settings, because it’s not connected to a netVM.</li>

            <p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/connecting-to-jondonym-before-tor-user-jondonym-tor-internet/2555/4">Connecting to JonDonym before Tor (User -&gt; JonDonym -&gt; Tor -&gt; Internet)</a>:</p>
<p>I’m really thrilled to see this post since I’m trying to do a similar work these days and you offers a lot of  helpful information!</p>
<p>What I’m doing can be called “Connecting to Lantern before Tor (User -&gt;  Lantern -&gt; Tor -&gt; Internet) on qubes-whonix”. And I believe the implement of that is very important for people in Tor-censored area, especially China, who use Whonix, because:<br>
1. Sadly, Tor Bridges and all kinds of Pluggable Transports provided by Tor project are no longer useful for people to circumvent the Internet censorship in China;<br>
2. OpenVPN which do have a introduction in Qubes Doc is completely censored by the GFW, so it is also impossible to use it to circumvent censorship. And I’m not aware of any reliable VPN to do that job (Of course there’re some VPN working in China but it is very likely they are all under the control and surveillance of CCP);<br>
3. Lantern (<a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/getlantern/lantern</a>) is one of the two effective tools on linux to cirvmvent the censorship;<br>
4. Another one is called Shadowsocks (<a href="https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-qt5/wiki/Installation" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-qt5/wiki/Installation</a>), however, it relys on a VPS builed by the user themselves, so it is a little bit hard to use by normal people;<br>
5. It is hard and extremely time-consuming for individuals to install lantern in VM themselves.</p>
<p>Apart from the most significant advantage that lantern makes Whonix useable in China, as far as I know, there’re some other benefit to use lantern before Tor which may also apply to use JonDonym before Tor (correct me if I’m wrong):<br>
1. The behavior Tor performs when connecting to Tor network is very unique so that it is very easy for ISP-level adversaries to know the fact you’re using Tor network; By using Lantern/ JonDonym to hid the fact you’re using Tor, one can mitigate the risk of correlation-attack;<br>
2.  One(or more in JonDonym) more public hops might be more difficult for a adversary to perform a trace-back attack?</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the idea that using Lantern is a separated ProxyVM because lantern is still in beta version and once it’s compromised, it is able to gain the traffic data which hasn’t been encrypted by Tor client yet if we installed it in the sys-whonix.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Lantern before Tor in a vbox-based Whonix. The way I implement it can be found in <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/thats-how-i-circumvent-tor-sensorship-in-china/2312">That’s how I circumvent Tor sensorship in China</a>. (And a more detailed version, but in chinese, can be found in my blog:<br>

) However, I do meet some problem when doing it on Qubes-whonix which you guys may be able to help:</p>
<p>I installed lantern in a separate ProxyVM behind sys-whonix.</p>
<p>I make Lantern listen on all interfaces by using Privoxy:<br>
listen-address: 0.0.0.0:8118<br>
Forward / 127.0.0.1:8787</p>
<p>But then I run ‘netstat’, only to find “127.0.0.1:Privoxy” instead of “0.0.0.0:privoxy”.</p>
<p>Although it can successfully ping the IP of the ProxyVM in sys-whonix, the port ProxyIP:8118 is unreachable. I’ve set the firewall of ProxyVM allow all connects but it doesn’t help:(</p>
<p>Anyone have any suggestions please?</p>
