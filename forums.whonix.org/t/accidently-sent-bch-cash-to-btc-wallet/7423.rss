    <title>Accidently Sent BCH Cash to BTC Wallet</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/accidently-sent-bch-cash-to-btc-wallet/7423</link>
    <description>Hi,
I have no idea if this is the correct place to ask this. Basically my problem is I sent Bit Coin Cash to a BTC Wallet. The user gave me his BTC wallet address and I had a bitcoin wallet (That had both BTC and BCH in it) and sent him bitcoin cash to his BTC wallet. I wasn&#39;t aware this could even be done but apparently it can. It&#39;s my understanding that he can recover it basically by creating a BCH wallet with the same address I guess but correct me if I&#39;m wrong. His question is can he use the BCH wallet with whonix? I guess this would be so he could maintain his anonymity. I apologize as I don&#39;t know a lot about cryptocurrency. The user just wants to maintain his privacy and I just want to either get my BCH cash back so I can send him BTC or make it so he can recover the BCH and maintain his privacy. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I&#39;m a noob that clearly didn&#39;t know what I was doing. Please help!</description>

            <p>Ok, if you meant “make sure the BTC address has no balance before importing the private keys to the BCH wallet” I can agree with this precaution.

<p>It’s used as an example for an untrustworthy wallet to avoid calling BCH<br>
untrustworthy but I really shouldn’t have called any names even when<br>
with BSV it’s as close to a consensus as it can get, I guess.</p>

</aside>
<p>What is your idea of a trustworthy wallet then? they are all “third party”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None is “trustworthy” to share the key to access on coins on two<br>
different chains. It’s just prudent to limit exposure of keys. This also<br>
presupposes using different VMs.</p>
<p>Safe Split means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>move coins away from BTC (or any other important chain) first so if<br>
the keys you are going to import into another wallet are worthless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then use the private keys (empty on BTC chain) on any other chain such<br>
as with a BCH wallet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you coding it yourself?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, certainly not required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or do you suggest the user run a full node and use its wallet?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No need for full node as far as safe split is concerned.</p>

<p>Electron should meet your requirements. Likely all that need to be done is copy over you mnemonic seed phrase to the new wallet and punch in your password.</p>
<p>Be sure to verify the AppImage before using. Also, there have been reports of counterfeit Electron websites. If you install an Electron wallet from one of these sites your BCH Cash will be stolen.

            <p>Ok thanks for your help I googled Bitcoin Cash wallet for Linux and Ubuntu. The same result comes up at the top all though I can’t post links here. If you think of the wallets name you used <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/sheep">@sheep</a> that might really help us cause right now its like the blind leading he f’ing blind. You’d think I’d know more about this since I worked in a bitcion mining facility for a few months but I don’t I’m sorry. So once we find the right wallet how to we import the private keys? does he just create a linux wallet with the same private keys as his bitcoin wallet?</p>

            <p>Let’s clear the confusion.<br>
If you sent BTC then the transaction is on the BTC blockchain.<br>
If you sent BCH then it’s on the BCH blockchain.<br>
It is correct both coins use same type of address and so errors like that can occur.<br>
To solve it, the receiver needs to import the private keys to the other coin.<br>
For example, if you actually sent BTC and he only has a BCH wallet, he needs to create a BTC wallet with the private keys of the BCH wallet. He can’t just have the balance move from one coin to another, that won’t happen.<br>
He needs to create a wallet for the coin that fits the transaction that actually tok place.</p>
<p>And yes, he can work with both BTC and BCH wallets within Whonix.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I have no idea if this is the correct place to ask this. Basically my problem is I sent Bit Coin Cash to a BTC Wallet. The user gave me his BTC wallet address and I had a bitcoin wallet (That had both BTC and BCH in it) and sent him bitcoin cash to his BTC wallet. I wasn’t aware this could even be done but apparently it can. It’s my understanding that he can recover it basically by creating a BCH wallet with the same address I guess but correct me if I’m wrong. His question is can he use the BCH wallet with whonix? I guess this would be so he could maintain his anonymity. I apologize as I don’t know a lot about cryptocurrency. The user just wants to maintain his privacy and I just want to either get my BCH cash back so I can send him BTC or make it so he can recover the BCH and maintain his privacy. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I’m a noob that clearly didn’t know what I was doing. Please help!</p>
