    <title>Fingerprinting installed addons of scripts not allowed?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/fingerprinting-installed-addons-of-scripts-not-allowed/3704</link>
    <description>I have read quite often that addons should not be installed on tor browser but I have I guess a two teired question regarding that. Is if possible for adversaries to fingerpring ones addons if scripts are turned off? If so, or even if not but perhaps I turn scripts on occasionally, or maybe can make make-life-difficult-for-adversaries reading whonixVM, how much am I compromising myself using addons? I ask because while having javascript turned off conviently does get rid of alot fo adverts etc it doesn&#39;t get rid of all, and I would like to use a page reformater, and a few other things to make reading more, enjoyable. Pitfalls?</description>

            <p>The best way to find out is to test it first before you do anything dangerous in your situation/location.</p>
<p>Go to one of the following websites and run tests with and without Javascript on and see what the reports show:</p>
<p><a href="http://browserleaks.com" class="onebox" target="_blank">browserleaks.com</a></p>
<aside class="onebox whitelistedgeneric">
  <header class="source">
      <img src="https://panopticlick.eff.org/static/favicon.ico" class="site-icon" width="16" height="16">
      <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">panopticlick.eff.org</a>
  </header>
  <article class="onebox-body">
    <div class="aspect-image" style="--aspect-ratio:690/345;"><img src="https://panopticlick.eff.org/static/images/panopticlick-og.png" class="thumbnail"></div>

<h3><a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Panopticlick</a></h3>

<p>Is your browser safe against tracking?</p>


  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>(There are many others, but you will quickly discover your needed information via the above three).</p>
<p>From previous testing, I suspect that even the presence of additional add-ons will show up, but without Javascript enabled a lot of additional information that might be leaked will show null results.</p>
<p>On the basis that the boilerplate advice from Tor devs is NOT to change the add-ons selection from the default HTTPS Everywhere and No Script ones, then it is safest to assume that the (likely) detection of further add-ons will make you very fingerprintable (unique) and thus traceable across the militarized net.</p>
<p>How badly do you want or need them? The majority of activities can be achieved in Tor Browser with the default configuration and (often) no Javascript.</p>
