    <description>I had a chat with the Tor developers and they confirm Hidden Service plans are being hashed out, but its going to happen

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;username&gt; Hi is there a revamp of Hidden Services in progress or planned? Or are waiting for contributors to step up before this happens?
&lt;velope&gt; see the proposal in the torspec repo and discussion on the tails-dev list
&lt;velope&gt; developer time is a major problem
&lt;velope&gt; but first it&#39;s an architecture-design problem, because there is not yet agreement on exactly what and how much to do
&lt;username&gt; Ovelope: alright so it is planned but its in the early planning phase yes?
&lt;username&gt; velope
&lt;username&gt; There is a certain feature like private hidden services planned from what I read in the torspec
&lt;velope&gt; i guess &quot;not yet agreement on exactly what and how much to do&quot; could be one definition of &quot;early&quot;
&lt;username&gt; I&#39;m trying to cite this as an upcoming feature on wiki, but it keeps getting rejected on the grounds that no overhaul is planned
&lt;velope&gt; wut
&lt;velope&gt; what wiki, and who rejecting
&lt;username&gt; Whonix wiki. The lead dev Patrick is very specific when it comes to citations
&lt;username&gt; but reading your weekly newsletter you mention the next-gen HS and are taking concrete steps to realize them
&lt;velope&gt; well, the newsletter is a secondary source that shouldn&#39;t be cited
&lt;username&gt; ok this chat log with your input is primary I guess
* velope chokes
&lt;velope&gt; the torspec proposal and tor-dev mail threads are primary
&lt;velope&gt; and it cannot be disputed that there has been preliminary design and discussion
&lt;username&gt; Understood. Thanks.
&lt;velope&gt; but really, whether it ever gets done depends on funding&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This weeks [url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-august-13th-2014]newsletter[/url] talks about the Next generation Hidden Services and guard parameters change as a preliminary step in that direction.

If that doesn&#39;t do it for you as a reference then I&#39;ll drop it.  :D</description>

Exactly my point. There is no funding yet = no work. Could likely be the same situation in five years from now. There is a bunch of tasks they would like to do with no funding for years. So this doesn't get me excited.
