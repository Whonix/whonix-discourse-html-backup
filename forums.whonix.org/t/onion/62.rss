    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m looking forward to use Whonix services by its .onion(s) exclusively and I currently have a question as well as a problem regarding this.

Is it correct that we basically have two (complete/redundant) .onion mirrors?
zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion
kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion

Onto the problem ;)
While MediaWiki is relatively linked and works great, the forums seem to be absolutely linked and this is an annoyance. Is it possible to configure SMF to also relatively link? I mean otherwise, one needs to manually copy the absolute URL to a particular SMF link, paste it and replace the actual domain for every single link.

EDIT: thinking about this further, is it even possible to actually create content (wiki articles/forum posts) via the .onion(s)? I mean, is it a two-way sync OR an alias (would somehow defeat the purpose of the onion) OR ... hopefully valid questions that come to my mind here.</description>

Nice one! Thanks for getting back to me here. I’m putting this next onto my ToDo list. Currently, I’m hard at work with LowFat Whonix 8.</p>

<p>Hi Cerberus!</p>
<p>I have a workaround for accessing the forum via .onion more easily, using HTTPS Everywhere and user rules.</p>
<p>Paste this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;ruleset name="Whonix Onion"&gt;
  &lt;target host="www.whonix.org" /&gt;
  &lt;target host="kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion" /&gt;
  &lt;rule from="^http(s)?://(www\.)?whonix\.org/" to="http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/"/&gt;
&lt;/ruleset&gt;</code><br>
into a file named “WhonixOnion.xml” in [Tor browser folder]/Data/Browser/profile.default/HTTPSEverywhereUserRules/ and restart the browser.</p>
<p>Now all your <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> traffic should be pointed at the onion. If you want to go back to <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> (and not .onion), the HTTPS Everywhere icon in the upper right will show your ruleset with a check box. Uncheck it, and continue browsing the .org!</p>
<p>The .onion and .org sites are identical, and edits / posts made on one domain will be reflected on the other. As Patrick said, the .onion isn’t really for privacy as it is for censorship-resistance and fallback in case DNS gets wonky.</p>
<p>For being a bit hacky, it’s a pretty solid solution - HTTPS Everywhere is clever and it does the rewrite <em>before</em> making the request, so the browser never asks for <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a>, only the .onion.</p>

Sure, I understand this.
<blockquote>"Optional Tor hidden service (.onion domain); alternative end-to-end encrypted/authenticated connection; in this use case, not for location privacy; backup in case DNS is not functional" (...) Only full anonymous development and .onion domain only could work. This isn't an option anymore, at least not for me since the word is out.</blockquote>
Thanks for explaining this. Actually I pushed your "outing" to the back of my mind for a second here. My mistake.

Not any longer. Fixed that. Thanks for spotting.

This is just a legal requirement. The old onion can only be removed there, when we take it offline.
<blockquote>What's the purpose of the onion then?</blockquote>
It's purpose is a bit hidden, documented on https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix:Privacy_policy in a footnote:
<p>“Optional Tor hidden service (.onion domain); alternative end-to-end encrypted/authenticated connection; in this use case, not for location privacy; backup in case DNS is not functional”</p>
<blockquote>If the onion is just an alias it doesn't provide any protection against "invading forces" anyways. If we'd change this, several onions for the subdomains may make sense, i.e. the forum physically isolated from the wiki, blog and so on. From a cosmetic perspective, I'm totally fine with the subfolder approach.</blockquote>
We probably won't make separate servers for blog/wiki/forum anytime soon. It's not worth it yet.
<p>There can be no protection from invading forces. Only full anonymous development and .onion domain only could work. This isn’t an option anymore, at least not for me since the word is out. Also you might not have heard about Whonix in the first place if we took that route.</p>

I see. What's the purpose of the onion then? I mean if the IP is publicly known, it isn't an emergency backup after all. Think stupid law-makers.

Thanks for the heads up. If I come across some useful information here, I'll let you know.

I see. I'm not sure what to vote for here. If the onion is just an alias it doesn't provide any protection against "invading forces" anyways. If we'd change this, several onions for the subdomains may make sense, i.e. the forum physically isolated from the wiki, blog and so on. From a cosmetic perspective, I'm totally fine with the subfolder approach.

            <p>zo7fksnun4b4v4jv.onion is our old onion. No longer advertised anywhere. We may take it offline at some point. Our new kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion onion will stay. They’re both running on the same server. Just kept the old one for compatibility.</p>
<p>The .onion domains are just alternative domains pointing served by the same server. No mirrors.</p>
<p>Editing the wiki using the .onion should work well.</p>
<p>About .onion support for the blog and the forum, we would like it. Seems tricky, though. Unless someone can provide a shortcut of telling us how to implement it. Fortasse still has it on its list.</p>
<p>Another issue is, that .onion domains do not support sub domains. At least not at time of writing. It may change in a few years, how knows. I guess <a href="http://forum.whonix.org">forum.whonix.org</a>, <a href="http://blog.whonix.org">blog.whonix.org</a> would be more attractive than <a href="http://whonix.org/forum">whonix.org/forum</a>. But we’re not aware of anyone coming up with a good solution for that in combination with .onion domains. The Tor Project uses several .onion domains for the various sub domains. I am not sure this is a better solution than /forum.</p>
