    <title>Warning! Qubes/Whonix is not safe by default</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/warning-qubes-whonix-is-not-safe-by-default/4913</link>
    <description>One must remember:  **there is nothing like safety by default.**

I did interesting test in situation where everything in LAN was infected. Infected Win, Mac, Linux computers, infected all mobile devices iOS/Android. Infected router. Everything was turned off, except router.
I was curious how much time unknown pentester will take to brake uninfected laptop with installed from scratch Qubes 3.2/Whonix...

Ok. Let,s turn it on!
If  it is connected to infected router, **it&#39;s matter of 5 minutes!**
Firstly he broke fedora nerwork VM, then he did access to XEN, and start some code to change boot process, at this time I turn off laptop.

After some time I did research with this laptop, and it&#39;s BIOS was changed on different version with backdoors.

**One must remember, there is no safety if your internet access is honeypot.**
Safety is no static. It is process of step-by-step hardening, not only Install and Go thing. 

And, please, avoid public free wifi connections. One can be knowledgeable those WiFi can be infected as well.

Save your internet connection IP, like it&#39;s your best treasure.</description>

            <p>Calling bullshit on that story.  It is clearly a made up story.</p>
<p>Indeed it is theoretically possible to use unknown exploits to escalate privileges, but <strong>no way</strong> a “random hacker” will use so many 0day vulns to attack a random user/IP.</p>
<p>Just step 1 is really really hard.  I can’t even remember the last RCE in Fedora (NetVM) and even if someone found a RCE in Fedora/Linux TCP stack, then they would most likely keep it very very secret.</p>

            <p>I dump my BIOS about once a week with the tools in UBCD and compare with what I had.  There are BIOS editors and blasters and all type of hardware tools.  Most of the of the shelf computers will not recover from a BIOS attack.  Whoever does the attack MUST know your exact hardware otherwise it will be obvious.</p>

<p>Agreed. Had my head up some rabbit hole when I wrote that. As in - a compromised (or unpatched) base install can override any update mechanism no matter how secure. Of course, in such a situation, all is already lost with no recourse. The point being that it’s imperative for any distro to provide patched images as expediently as possible - which Qubes makes every effort to do.</p>

<p>Please understand that the Qubes OS Project cannot act on these sorts of claims when no details are provided about how to reproduce or verify the alleged vulnerabilities. If the alleged vulnerabilities actually exist, we’d love nothing more than to fix and announce them while giving due credit to the discoverer(s) (if we haven’t already done so), but in the absence of any actionable information, there is simply nothing for us to do.</p>
<p>Like most software projects, businesses, and websites, we receive several vague claims through improper channels about alleged security vulnerabilities every week (most of which are spam or phishing attempts). If we were to try to investigate even a fraction of these, we would never have time to pursue the main goals of the project. Given their lack of credibility, the only reasonable response is to ignore them.</p>
<p>By contrast, when someone responsibly discloses a security vulnerability through the proper channel, we always take it seriously. For details, please see: <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/security/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/security/</a></p>

</aside>
<p>These two comments are not entirely accurate (or, at least, might be misleading to some readers). It depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Every Qubes update must be validly cryptographically signed before it is applied. As long as the hypothetical vulnerability does not compromise this procedure, receiving updates through a compromised network will still be secure, since the packages will either be authentic (as proven by their valid cryptographic signatures) or will not be installed at all.</p>
<p>For dom0 updates, in particular, see: <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dom0-secure-updates/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/dom0-secure-updates/</a><br>
(While TemplateVMs do not implement the same procedure as dom0, the default templates also require valid cryptographic signatures on all packages.)</p>
<p>Since the Qubes security model assumes that the network is untrusted, we usually respond to vulnerabilities that compromise the update process by releasing new ISOs in which the vulnerability is patched.</p>

            <p>No modern high density silicone is safe.  I did a lot (2-3K) of systems and networks that are safe even from a nuke in space (685 in one year OEM).  That is why your water is not shut off by hackers,  your traffic lights work most of the time, people do not take over emergency room equipment, US nukes are on 1990’s technology etc…(including North Korean things).  I was taken through Qubes 3.2 and RC4.4 but nothing like 5 minutes (more slowly over days).  If you want to be more secure have Fedora 27 Security Labs installed as a template and NetVM (some work! but a lot of things work out of the box).</p>
<p>This has to be in the political part of this forum!</p>

<p>I believe OP conducted these tests i.e. pentesting. That’s how I understood it. Could be wrong though.</p>
<p>EDIT: I see now, an attacker compromised all systems on LAN and OP wanted to see how long it took a newly istalled Qubes 3.2. to be compromised.  Thanks for clarifying that <code>entr0py</code>!</p>
