    <description>Not entirely sure this is the right place, but hoping it would be useful/interesting to the Whonix community. (Feel free to remove/ask me to repost elsewhere if this is not the right place).

I have recently written a sandboxing suite for some desktop programs I use quite often (e.g. browsers, PDF readers).

Some recent designs took inspiration from sandbox-app-launcher (http://forums.whonix.org/t/system-wide-sandboxing-framework-sandbox-app-launcher/9008), but overall objective is to make each script more tailored to the program rather than making a general tool.

Main features
- Private home for programs
- Shell interpreter access is removed in the sandbox
- Access to number of binaries is minimized (via bubblewrap and AppArmor)
- Fairly strict seccomp filters are supplied to bubblewrap
- Fairly strict AppArmor profiles are generated

Repo: https://github.com/darrenldl/sandboxing

(README &quot;Profiles&quot; section contains an overview of profiles ready to be used)</description>
