    <title>Tor in the whonix-host</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-in-the-whonix-host/11329</link>
    <description>Since I read the wiki indicating Tor-over-Tor in the whonix-workstation is dangerous, is it secure to install tor and tor browser bundle in the whonix-host instead? And if so, what is the traffic route in both host and workstation like? I assume in the host would be host -&gt; tor -&gt; server, and the workstation would be host -&gt; tor -&gt; tor -&gt; server?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>And just to add some motivations to my question: my initial thought was inspired by the ongoing whonix-host development which is expected to torify the entire host. For now, ISP could see the host having un-tor traffics and the workstation having all-tor traffics at the same time. I guess thatâ€™s suspicious? Thus I came up with the above question: should I use tor in the host as well or is there any better way?</p>
