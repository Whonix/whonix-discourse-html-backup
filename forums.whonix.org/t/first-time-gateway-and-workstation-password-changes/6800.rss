    <description>Have read posts regarding password changing. I am a rank beginner at this level so if some one could go through the password changing routine, step by step I may be able to move on from here. Terms like root/user,user password etc make no sense to me. Help would be really appreciated. I´m not dumb, don´t answer that!!, I´m just old. Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>Hi, thank you for the feedback. This will hopefully help us to clarify documentation.</p>
<p>Whonix is based on Debian.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a></p>
<p>Therefore often terminology is the same as for Debian, or in a wider sense same as for Linux and often even same as for any linux distribution.</p>
<p>root means superuser or administrator.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser</a></p>
<p>The superuser in Linux is in most (like Whonix) if not all cases called <code>root</code>.</p>
<p>For better anonymity, the non-superuser, normal user account is called <code>user</code>.</p>
<p>I’ve modified <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Post_Install_Advice#Change_Passwords" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Post_Install_Advice#Change_Passwords</a> a bit more more clarify right now. Hope that helps.</p>
