    <title>(Whonix KVM, non-qubes) Waydroid issues</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-kvm-non-qubes-waydroid-issues/15922</link>
    <description>I have Waydroid working on what (last time I checked was yesterday) is the latest version of whonix on KVM this is because Anbox sadly did not work. I have also managed to get some APKs on there and they work. 

While this is all good, I am experiencing some issues, namely that the waydroid setup I have going right now does not seem to be connected to the internet, which I require for the task I am doing, as it requires a connection. I suspect that this could be related to the firewall in whonix, as I saw in a past question about waydroid where the user solved their problem by allowing UDP (I think), and it was for a network related issue. I completed the steps in the wiki and nothing seems to have changed.

Anybody else using waydroid on whonix waydroid with this problem? Also if anyone answering wants more details about my problem feel free to HMU</description>
