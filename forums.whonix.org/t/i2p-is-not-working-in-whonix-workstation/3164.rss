    <title>I2P is not working in whonix-workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/i2p-is-not-working-in-whonix-workstation/3164</link>
    <description>I followed all instructions on this page &#39;https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P&#39; but I could not able to get it running. I done all the steps and then waited for few hrs and checked the status as well. 
&#39;sudo systemctl status i2p&#39; timer showing network is activated 30 min ago. I still cant access i2p websites through tor browser. Time out error and server not found error.
I checked the iceweasel and I can see foxyproxy extension but not activated, in tor browser I cant see anything as such.

   Is there anything else I suppose to do?</description>

            <p>You can check  ‘/var/log/i2p/wrapper.log’ to see if the I2P Router did start and succesfully build a tunnel.<br>
But first you should read the Wikipage carefully and do the steps described there.</p>
