    <title>Using wlan0 to Connect to Internet on Physical Isolating Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-wlan0-to-connect-to-internet-on-physical-isolating-gateway/3588</link>
    <description>Hey!

So I am wanting to create a physical middlebox (or as Tor and Whonix is calling it a Physical Isolating Gateway) but the device I am using only has one Ethernet port and one Wireless card.

What I am wanting to do is connect the workstation (which will run on hardware and not a virtual machine ~ please don&#39;t ask why) via Ethernet and then connect the Gateway to my router via Wifi. Is this possible? How would one go about doing this?

I have been reading [Whonix&#39;s Physical Isolation guide](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation) but need more detail on this part.

Thank you,

_Also:_

**Edit:**
The gateway is running on a 64bit operating system (Debian Stable/Jessie) and has no DE (but will install one if needed).</description>
