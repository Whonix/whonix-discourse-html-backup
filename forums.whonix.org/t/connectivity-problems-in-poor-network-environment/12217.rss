    <description>I use ISP service who is known to artificially limit network traffic. I noticed this as I have trouble during connection initiation to Tor when I use Whonix in virtual machines and I don&#39;t have the same issue if I use another network provider. When I try to connect to a website on Workstation I open wireshark on the host system and observe many ICMP packets with notice &quot;Destination Unreachable(fragmentation needed)&quot; sent from nodes inside ISP&#39;s network. Sometimes I can connect succesfully to websites, most of the times I can&#39;t.

But if I use tor browser on my host machine to connect to the very same sites I have no problem at all. Connection is successful 100% of times and I see only a few destination unreachable packets. 

I guess I have a problem with particular obfs4 bridges on whonix? Once I couldn&#39;t use whonix at all because it didn&#39;t find bridges in torrc available for use even in networks with no latency issues. I spontaneously fixed it with reconfiguring tor connection settings and choosing obfs4 transport once again in tor settings. Old bridges were replaced with new ones.</description>

            <p>I used apt with sudo to upgrade software. I omitted sudo in my post above.</p>
<p>This is the first time I report problems with open source software to maintainers. All other times in the past I just was too lazy to do this but had a reason to do this. I suspect there are many users like me. But this is whole different topic</p>

            <p>Upgrading without sudo/root isn’t possible. That cannot be the issue.</p>
<p>Upgrading can cause issues but should not. If that was to happen, then many users would report the same issues. Upgrading is important.</p>
<p>Given the situation, for Whonix 16 stable release of consider <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-16-0-0-8-debian-11-bullseye-based-for-virtualbox-major-release-testers-wanted/12190" class="inline-onebox">Whonix 16.0.0.8 (Debian 11 bullseye based) - for VirtualBox - Major Release - Testers Wanted!</a>.</p>

            <p>Several times I upgraded whonix with “apt update &amp;&amp; apt upgrade” instead of sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. Maybe this was the cause of problems?</p>

<p>I downloaded whonix from whonix dot org website and verify it with signature</p>

            <p>Yes. Was renamed to systemcheck. Typing whonixcheck should still be functional due to compatibly symlink.</p>
<p>Where did you download Whonix from?</p>

</aside>
<p>That seems outdated. There is no such reference in the source code anymore in the current Whonix version.</p>
<p>At the rate you’re having strange issues which nobody else is reporting I suspect you’ve downloaded an old Whonix version from somewhere else?</p>
<p>I suggest to re-install Whonix and download Whonix from <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a>.</p>

            <p>I tried running systemcheck or whonixcheck because this is how it’s called on my whonix version. If I type whonixcheck in console it says it cannot find the script. The same thing happens if I launch it with GUI.<br>
whereis command reports it is located in /usr/bin/whonixcheck and when I run “file /usr/bin/whonixcheck” it outputs “broken symbolic link to systemcheck”. I also have /usr/lib/whonixcheck directory as whereis says and I have whonixcheck script file inside it. When I launch it outputs “whonixcheck script bug” with “error_cause: error handler signal ERR detected with BASH_COMMAND: touch /run/whonixcheck/${IDENTIFIER}_running”</p>
<p>I’ll try installing and testing non whonix VM connectivity later</p>
