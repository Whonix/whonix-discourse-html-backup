    <title>Saving virtual machine with shared folder</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/saving-virtual-machine-with-shared-folder/3260</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. First of all, thank you for your work on whonix, it&#39;s awesome!
But I have a problem, which for me is very annoying. One thing I love about virtual machines is that any time I can just save VM&#39;s state and run it from this state some time later. But when I trying to save vm with shared folder from virt-manager I&#39;m getting this error:

Error saving domain: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command &#39;migrate&#39;: Migration is disabled when VirtFS export path &#39;/home/john/files&#39; is mounted in the guest using mount_tag &#39;shared&#39;

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/asyncjob.py&quot;, line 88, in cb_wrapper
    callback(asyncjob, *args, **kwargs)
  File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/engine.py&quot;, line 1084, in cb
    vm.save(meter=asyncjob.get_meter())
  File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/libvirtobject.py&quot;, line 83, in newfn
    ret = fn(self, *args, **kwargs)
  File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/domain.py&quot;, line 1441, in save
    self._backend.managedSave(0)
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libvirt.py&quot;, line 1400, in managedSave
    if ret == -1: raise libvirtError (&#39;virDomainManagedSave() failed&#39;, dom=self)
libvirtError: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command &#39;migrate&#39;: Migration is disabled when VirtFS export path &#39;/home/john/files&#39; is mounted in the guest using mount_tag &#39;shared&#39;

Is there any way that I can fix this error? Thank you</description>

            <p>That concerns an upstream feature request. Although note that “live” snapshots are recommended against in general because their state is easily corrupted.</p>
