I am not a fan of NTP&#39;s unauthenticated nature and inability to work over Tor, but I am sure it&#39;s already the apocalypse. In this thread I would like to discuss how much it can be skewed.

Added a source and made some calculations here:

Just a transparent proxy alone isn't a great idea in many situations anyway.
<p>I guess Android really doesn’t use NTP, because those clocks are synced by the carrier network.</p>
<blockquote>One can reveal your HS while the other just gives signs that you may be running a relatively uncommon setup.</blockquote>
This is a good argument to make fingerprinting a low priority. That stuff isn't binary 1 or 0. An arms race. At the moment censors work on detecting traffic flows and The Tor Project and devs are coming up with clever pluggable transports. When at some day things like "no Y (ex: NTP), but should be, probably X" are done by censors, hopefully there will be a separate team to create a fake operating system that emits the expected fingerprint.

Yes, NTP would not have helped. I just wanted to show that small things like “just a second” can have broader consequences nevertheless.</p>
<blockquote>If you don't want to recommend it its ok.</blockquote>
It's hard for me to recommend things, if I don't fully understand them. It would be okay to present the current state of knowledge and research, which is that there are open questions as per:
https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,512.msg3945.html#msg3945
<blockquote>When there are TAILS users, the traffic will not have TCP timestamps, so should this dangerous information be left to leak so traffic is not marked for that? I don't think so.</blockquote>
Leaving them enabled seems the worse than being fingerprintable. An better solution may be be something like SkewMask.

<p>“What kind of fingerprinting resistance a system like Tails can reasonably pretend to, at the network scale?” was the only question before they updated the ticket. It’s a hard question. The fingerprinting stuff is an arms race. As well as a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Most people are behind routers. The way DPI distinguishes individual machines behind a router is through tracking TCP time leaks.</p>
<p>When there are TAILS users, the traffic will not have TCP timestamps, so should this dangerous information be left to leak so traffic is not marked for that? I don’t think so.</p>
<p>I’m not pushing for this. If you don’t want to recommend it its ok.</p>

<p>The "leap second" crash -- which hit several web operations on Saturday evening -- can be traced to a single glitch in the Linux operating system. Here's the inside story on what happened.</p>

<p>Why did they about implementing NTP in the first place?</p>
<p>Why did all operating systems bother installing it by default?</p>
<p>What are the consequences of the clock drift that will inevitably result from this?</p>
<p>How much does a usual hardware clock drift per day, month, etc?</p>
<p>How much does defect hardware clock drift per day, month, etc?</p>
<p>Yeah, maybe a giant nag screen to ask the user once to check its system clock and relying from then on hardware clock only may work. But as I know users, they don’t care about defect hardware clocks that are far off. We need to be really careful with decisions as this one. Can’t act on assumptions.</p>

            <p>Looks good.</p>
<p>AFAIK this can be extrapolated from similar siutationss: Because it lacks encryption and authentication, an attacker could MITM the request, impersonate an NTP server and potentially tell any lie they like to the clock. A replay attck could skew the clock so much that it could fall in a range that makes Tor fail to connect.</p>
