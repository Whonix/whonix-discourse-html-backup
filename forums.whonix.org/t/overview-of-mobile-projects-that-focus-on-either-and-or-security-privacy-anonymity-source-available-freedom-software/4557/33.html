would not use that option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s fundamentally not possible to implement it in a way that doesn’t degrade the security of regular users.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I previously didn’t reply since I am not that deep into Android. And it would have taken a long time to form an opinion reviewing your technical points.</p>
<p>Your technical arguments against even opt-in root decreasing security may be true. Likely, they are true. I will assume in my reply, that they are in fact true.</p>
<p>I think our disagreement is prioritization. You seem to prioritize security over user freedom. [1]</p>
<p>Here is the freedom restriction that I am seeing:<br>
The 4 original essential software freedoms as defined by the Free Software movement are granted. However, since the inception of the 4 original essential software freedoms, other issues came up sometimes called tivoization, malicious feature, antifeature, tyrant software, treacherous computing or DRM (digital restrictions management).</p>
<p>Non-root enforcement can be considered a lesser form of tyrant software or antifeature since it doesn’t restrict flashing an alternative, but cripples the system in major ways. You might argue you can use userdebug version or software fork and compile a version that doesn’t do this, but then the networking effect and scale of a project becomes so great that rolling an own fork has negligible effects and upstream choices are the de-facto state of things.</p>
<p>Non-root enforcement is also similar to DRM. While DRM is about applications which don’t allow users to easily, freely copy data on their own devices, non-root enforcement here leads to users not able to backup/copy/migrate their application data from one phone to another. Either the application has a backup / data export feature or data is “trapped” inside the phone. Even with a app dependent app data backup feature, it’s better if users who choose so can get access to the raw data stored by the app for convenience (not using tons of different data export features rather than scripting backups, data export feature may be incomplete, analysis of app data by user).</p>
<p>Non-root enforcement also aids DRM enabled applications. If GrapheneOS gets more popular, perhaps picked up my phone manufacturers or resellers, mobile carriers it will be easy for application developers to utilize DRM. To prevent the user from accessing application data. Making phone work in the interest of the application developer rather than phone user.</p>
<p>Phone manufacturers or resellers, mobile carriers couldn’t be blamed for refusing root access. That would already be the GrapheneOS default. They could conveniently blame it on “security”. Some power users might be able to flash a root-enabled version but the effect would be negligible. In practice, this will result in a lot users having their freedom restricted.</p>
<p>[1] But even the security vs user freedom view is a false dichotomy. Bootloaders allow for flexibility to boot into a root-enabled mode. There could be a key combination and/or boot menu which allows users to boot into root-enabled mode. There could be timeouts [user has to wait 5 seconds before proceeding a anti-root warning] / strong warnings. Booting into root-enabled mode could make subsequent boots into non-root enabled mode show a warning that the device may be compromised due to previous boot into root-enabled mode.</p>
<p>The question is rather, how much time/effort/money would be required to grant user freedom (root) in a secure way (such as alternative boot options)? If you were offered 1 million USD and had time, could you implement root access in a secure way? This is unrealistic and just and example to encourage imagination of solutions. Is this really a question of unsolvable security issues vs user freedom? Or is it rather prioritization effort/time/money required to implement user freedom (root) vs other goals (just don’t prioritize on user freedom, make something work for novice users, more quickly monetize (understood, we all need to eat)).</p>

<p>That’s not true. If users want root, they can unlock their bootloader and make whatever modifications they want. Users that don’t need root shouldn’t have it exposed at all.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers don’t allow unlocking the bootloader but that’s the fault of the manufacturer, not Android. Would it be the fault of Whonix if someone made a fork which ripped out the superroot boot mode?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s not true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think that statement can be shrunk to a single line and I think<br>
I’ve already elaborated why I came to that conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some manufacturers don’t allow unlocking the bootloader but that’s the fault of the manufacturer, not Android. Would it be the fault of Whonix if someone made a fork which ripped out the superroot boot mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, because Whonix implemented superroot and someone else ripped that<br>
out. Can’t be responsible for action of third party and neither are any<br>
actions by Whonix useful to justify that. Would be different if Whonix<br>
didn’t implement superroot by default. Plus I would criticize that and<br>
argue for superroot boot mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can’t allow root in production if you want security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand that premise. bootloaders allow for that flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If users want root, they can unlock their bootloader and make whatever<br>
modifications they want. Users that don’t need root shouldn’t have it<br>
exposed at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My previous post describes how bootloaders allow for that flexibility.</p>
<p>It’s a question of usability vs freedom vs security vs priorities vs<br>
economical realities.</p>
<p>About how hard will it be to gain root. Unlock bootloader (more<br>
difficult) or key combination during bootloader (easier). It’s very<br>
similar just combination during bootloader might not be implemented due<br>
to low priority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you allow unrestricted root, the attacker will just go for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning, it needs to have bad usability, otherwise users will do it?</p>

<p>Steps include, simplified:</p>

<li>do something on your computer - skipable [1]</li>
<li>boot in normal mode and enable something (USB debugging and OEM unlock) in android settings (usability still good if this is kept)</li>
<li>connect USB - skipable [1]</li>
<li>do something on your computer - skipable [1]</li>
<li>automatic factory reset (I don’t see need for this except DRM which is a bad reason.)</li>

<li>boot in normal mode and enable something</li>
<li>reboot</li>
<li>bootloader now allows to boot into root mode</li>

<p>Also for physical security root mode could require (a special) PIN code or whatever. (What’s good enough physical for normal boot is also good enough for root enabled boot.)</p>

<p>If user choose to to enable root mode and choose root boot in boot loader, I don’t see how any attacker has any advantage.</p>
<p>A local attacker can try to boot into either non-root or root mode. Either way, there is encryption / access controls. I don’t see why in one case encryption / access controls are weaker.</p>

<p>I am not convinced this dilemma exists.</p>
<p>I don’t see why Android couldn’t do similar as planned in <a href="../../multiple-boot-modes-for-better-security-persistent-user-live-user-persistent-secureadmin-persistent-superadmin-persistent-recovery-mode/7708/32.html" class="inline-onebox">multiple boot modes for better security: persistent user | live user | persistent admin | persistent superadmin | persistent recovery mode</a>. (That concept is generic. Works for both, hosts and VMs.) Seems like saying “when booting into superadmin delete /home/user first”. When using full disk encryption (FDE) it doesn’t matter which boot mode is used. If local attacker doesn’t know password, it’s considered secure.</p>
<p>I don’t see how Debian based vs Android based changes something conceptually.</p>

</aside>
<p>I see. For phones, that’s because of “BIOS” is root of trust is read-only in hardware, which verifies the first stage, the bootloader which then verifies in a chain kernel and so forth.</p>
<p>Verified boot can work in principle also on computers using SecureBoot and/or heads. It uses a TPM and measured boot. Doesn’t extend to user space but that’s just a lack of implementation rather than conceptual impossibility.</p>
<p><a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://github.com/osresearch/heads">https://github.com/osresearch/heads</a></p>
<p>Example implementation (see “boot integrity”):<br>
<a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://insurgo.ca/">https://insurgo.ca</a></p>
<p>I am writing this to show that I don’t see the conceptual differences between computer hardware and phone hardware which somehow introduce a (conceptual) difference which in one case allows for secure root-enabled boot mode without user data wiping (computer) but not in another case (android) that’s not possible.</p>

<p>That’s a rather complex attack. Similar to installing a hardware keylogger, microphone (can guess keystrokes) and/or miniature camera during the absence of the victim into/near a computer.</p>
<p>Also “just replace the bootloader” sounds simple but for phones there are many phones where people would like to unlock the bootloader but that freedom is refused by the device vendor. For many phones, mortals cannot replace the bootloader.</p>

<p>That feature might have a point. But should have an opt-in or opt-out. (Probably opt-out since it’s default already.) If it’s possible to securely implement booting into normal boot mode, enabling OEM unlocking in android settings, then it conceptually must also be possible to add an option to disable “wipe user data when bootloader gets unlocked”.</p>

<p>Let’s consider local attackers. If figured out it’s infeasble it can be ignored but would be good to at least consider and describe why that is. heads / insurgo make that seem realistic to cover some local threat models.</p>

    I am copying over the conceptual notes to a wiki page and refining the concept. Please check: 


What would probably cause chaos is to have sometimes 1 word and sometimes 2 words.

super root

also 

admin
super admin

“But I used root.” “You need super root.” “I mean, I used super root.” 
Therefore I think single words should be avoided. Documentation should introduce and consistently use two words. Which ones? 

limited admin / limited root
super root / super root

<p>Agreed but I don’t see how that’s related.<br>
Modified unencrypted parts would be hopefully caught by verified boot implementation.</p>

<p>The only thing required in step 1) is enable OEM unlocking. Remote root compromise (suppose which would be undone by verified boot) to enable OEM unlocking would be the only thing the attacker would care about. The attack would succeed so far.</p>
<p>My premise is:<br>
remote exploit that gained root on android -&gt; can enable OEM unlocking in android settings</p>
<p>If that is the only thing the attacker does… And accept premise verified boot will undo attacker root… Then still, after reboot OEM unlocking is still activated. Now back to what you said…</p>

<li>automatic factory reset (I don’t see need for this except DRM which is a bad reason.)</li>

</aside>
<p>As I wrote before:</p>
<p>I don’t see why this procedure couldn’t be simplified in principle. Slightly refined:</p>
<ul>
<li>boot in normal mode and enable something</li>
<li>reboot</li>
<li>bootloader now allows to boot into root mode (require physical button press)</li>
</ul>
<p>What you said “With the way it is now, the attacker has to compromise the device remotely first to enable OEM unlocking and then have physical access to the device to unlock the bootloader which then wipes all user data so they can’t access anything.” is still the same under my proposed model. Just that has better usability, because less steps required.</p>

<p>Not really. Even if you think modifying the bootloader is too complex, you can modify something simpler like the base system.</p>

<p>Same difficulty. The internal storage drive of an android device cannot<br>
be easily removed. Without booting the device and going through<br>
permitted APIs, no file can be removed. In comparison to computers, hard<br>
drives can be unplugged, plugged into another computer and modified<br>
there. Maybe can be de-soldered?</p>
<p>This is btw also a data recovery and security disadvantage of phones:<br>
internal storage drive cannot be removed my mortals. Hence not mounted<br>
in a device (computer or so) considered secure. Therefore hard to do<br>
data recovery and checking for malware.</p>
<p>I’ve also read somewhere internal storage drive of an android device is<br>
“married” to hardware, disk encryption. I.e. when desoldered and mounted<br>
elsewhere it cannot be decrypted because disk encryption key is<br>
practically impossible to extract for mortals (similar to smartcard<br>
chips). At most the system partition could be read but data in user<br>
partition is inaccessible.</p>

<p>Encryption on android only covers the userdata partition because there’s no point in encrypting the others when they’re covered by verified boot and hold no sensitive information.</p>

<p>Mostly yes.</p>
<p>(I guess an argument could be made for encrypting system partition,<br>
/boot (same as for Linux desktop) but maybe not a strong one, overrules<br>

<p>b) A simplified root opt-in without wiping user data.</p>
<p>Subject a) is fully independent from subject b). But subject b) depends<br>
on subject a). And certainly related.</p>
<p>For subject a), I don’t see why opt-in root enabled boot mode<br>
necessities unlocking the bootloader or disabling verified boot.</p>
<p>Android might currently disable verified boot when unlocking bootloader,<br>
but the current implementation legacy must not be a hindrance for future<br>
designs proposals.</p>
<p>Considering a lot arbitrary, proprietary phones with google android. For<br>
a lot of these phones there are - manufacture unwanted - root unlock<br>
procedures available. In essence, these run a known exploit to gain root<br>
temporarily which allows to install something to gain root permanently.<br>
At no stage the bootloader or verified boot enters this concept.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there are many phones where rooting is possible while<br>
bootloader unlock has not been accomplished by the modding community.</p>
<p>This is to show that bootloader / verified boot / rooting is all<br>
somewhat independent. The only thing in my proposal that is different is<br>
the way to accomplish the goal.</p>
<p>Either, run an (often closed source) exploit from an unknown source<br>
somewhere from the internet to enable some setting in android or provide<br>
simpler steps the user can use (boot into normal mode, opt-in some<br>
settings, reboot, some key combination at boot).</p>

<p>Suppose the attacker has (temporarily until reboot) root compromised the<br>

consideration once physical access is established? Most data by then is<br>
accessible anyhow even without root.</p>
<p>Well, there might be one barrier. FDE and/or lockscreen. But a root<br>
compromise would also leak FDE and/or lockscreen credentials?</p>
<p>But I don’t see much issue anyhow. When we start with “suppose the<br>
attacker has (temporarily until reboot) root compromised”, well, then<br>
most is lost already anyhow. After such as (temporarily until reboot)<br>
root compromise most data can be extracted over remote from attacker<br>
anyhow. Why one would bother with local access after remote root exploit<br>
is unclear to me.</p>

          <p>I sent this via email and it didn’t work so I’m copy-pasting that directly to here with whatever mangling happened due to email / MIME nonsense. Don’t feel like going through it all again and correcting it. A bunch of further posts were made here since the one that tagged me and I’m not particularly interested in reading through those or replying to them either. Hopefully whatever is pasted below is readable.</p>
<p>It seems like you haven’t really read through what I’ve written previously.<br>
You don’t understand the security model and you’re unaware of the basic<br>
functionality of the OS including backup support. You disregard and dismiss<br>
that there’s an officially supported userdebug variant of the OS offering<br>
root access in a sensible way. You make it seem as if it’s something which<br>
has to be invented when it already exists and is officially supported. I<br>
don’t understand why you have a problem with GrapheneOS offering both user<br>
and userdebug builds. Most people in the GrapheneOS community want user<br>
builds and it’s what fits the goals of the project. You say you believe in<br>
software freedom but you don’t support people’s freedom to deliberately<br>
choose to use an OS without root support. This improves their security at<br>
the expense of not having a feature that a tiny minority of people would<br>
ever use. For those people who want to use it, userdebug builds are<br>
available as an option. It’s regularly tested and is officially supported<br>
by us. Any issues specific to userdebug builds will be treated as a high<br>
priority since it’s important to developers, although there have never been<br>
any of those issues discovered. It isn’t something that’s neglected or not<br>
properly supported. We fully support both user and userdebug builds. We do<br>
not officially support eng builds, but that’s not relevant to the topic of<br>
root access since userdebug builds provide it. The official tagged releases<br>
have full support for userdebug builds and in fact it’s tested for every<br>
release. It’s not something second class.</p>
<p>We would happily publish official userdebug builds using a different set of<br>
signing keys. It would require doubling the space available on the update<br>
server and more importantly doubling the time needed to make official<br>
releases. The project’s resources are already stretched very thin both in<br>
terms of money and development time. If you want us to make official<br>
userdebug builds available, you’re welcome to donate the money to cover<br>
upgrading the storage on the update server and a powerful local workstation<br>
/ server to build the releases. I can cover the electricity costs out of<br>
pocket and I’m even willing to spend the time building/maintaining the<br>
setup and making the releases. I’ve talked about this multiple times and<br>
there has never been interest from the community in making official<br>
userdebug builds available. Providing the resources to do this is the<br>
responsibility of people who want it. If you want it, it’s on you to make<br>
it possible to do it. It’s your choice to spend your time attacking the<br>
project by spreading misinformation and spin about it instead of helping us<br>
get the resources to provide something that we’ve wanted to provide for<br>
years. It would be helpful to offer userdebug builds so that people could<br>
help us more with debugging issues without building the OS. People who want<br>
root access for reasons aside from debugging could also use them. I don’t<br>
see another use case for it, but if people want to use it they’re welcome<br>
to do that. Our tagged releases already have fully tested official support<br>
for userdebug builds. I test it for every single official release. The only<br>
thing we don’t do is publish them particularly since that would mean<br>
building for each device. GrapheneOS hardening results in more specialized<br>
builds than AOSP so we aren’t able to reuse builds across similar devices<br>
or use generic kernels / system images like AOSP. The only option is<br>
building and publishing another release per supported device, doubling the<br>
overall release engineering work. I think you’re misinterpreting our lack<br>
of resources to do this as a decision not to provide these releases. That’s<br>
not the case. Provide the funding and I’ll start making these releases as<br>
soon as the parts for a new workstation arrive. I’ve already set things up<br>
so that it can be done.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>AOSP and GrapheneOS already support root access with the minimal possible<br>
impact to security via userdebug builds with ro.adb.secure=3D1. A userdebug<br>
build exists primarily to provide root access. It makes root available via<br>
ADB, which requires physical access. If ro.adb.secure is enabled in the<br>
build configuration, it makes it more like a user build by preserving the<br>
physical security model for ADB by requiring that it be enabled within the<br>
owner account along with requiring that the owner account approves the key<br>
for a host to be able to use ADB access. These keys automatically expire on<br>
a regular basis, so there is no such thing as truly persistent long-term<br>
ADB access. I think the default expiry is something like 30 days but I<br>
don’t feel like checking right now. We do not priority security over user<br>
freedom. We have the best of both worlds via these build variants already.<br>
A user build provides maximum security, a userdebug build with<br>
ro.adb.secure=3D1 is insecure with control over the owner account OR<br>
persistent state + physical access, a regular userdebug build is insecure<br>
with physical access and an eng build enables further debug features for<br>
development which are not desirable in production. A userdebug build with<br>
ro.adb.secure=3D1 is pretty much a production build other than having root<br>
access and other debugging features available via ADB. The other debugging<br>
features are not particularly relevant to security since root access could<br>
be used to do the same things.</p>
<p>Root access via control of the owner account OR physical access + an<br>
exploit to enable ADB + whitelist the key causes substantial damage to the<br>
security model of the OS and harms users by making them more vulnerable to<br>
real world threats. It makes them far more vulnerable to compromises by<br>
people they trust or through coercion. Some examples are an abusive<br>
romantic partner or friend, law enforcement, violent criminals, etc. who<br>
are now able to get root access via temporary control of the owner account.<br>
That temporary control now allows them to obtain lots of data they<br>
otherwise could not obtain including bypassing app locks features which<br>
either do not use encryption (such as Signal’s app lock) or which are not<br>
currently at rest (i.e. decryption has happened and the app currently has<br>
access to the data). They can give the device back to the user and keep<br>
root access until the device is rebooted. Even if the user is aware of the<br>
benefit of rebooting, they could put software on the device to trick people<br>
into thinking that the device has rebooted by mimicking the boot sequence.<br>
Consider an abusive romantic partner using 1 minute of access to the owner<br>
account to get root access until reboot, which they can now use to spy on<br>
their partner in a way that they cannot detect even if they are suspicious<br>
about it. The owner can look through all the installed apps, app<br>
permissions and check for device management or accessibility services which<br>
will give them a false sense of security but the device has been deeply<br>
compromised and they are being watched. The only way to deal with this is<br>
forcing an actual reboot by making sure to hold the power button even past<br>
the point that the device appears to turn off since that could be the<br>
attacker faking it. Even after doing that, there can be all kinds of nasty<br>
things left persistent in persistent state compromising the security of<br>
future usage of the device unless the user triggers a reset of persistent<br>
state in the OS either via Settings or recovery. You can choose to ignore<br>
these kinds of threat models, but they are not ignored by GrapheneOS. These<br>
kinds of attacks are a much more realistic threat to the vast majority of<br>
being than being remotely compromised via zero day exploits. It’s important<br>
that we not only improve the security for these less interesting forms of<br>
compromises but also work to improve it by providing more visibility and<br>
review of installed apps and granted permissions / special permissions /<br>
access. Root access ruins the security model on a deep level.</p>
<p>Persistent app-accessible root accessible is a completely different beast<br>
completely ruining verified boot and adding a massive amount of attack<br>
surface and I’m not going to go into that. It’s what people usually mean<br>
when they talk about the OS being “rooted”. It isn’t what userdebug builds<br>
provide and unlike userdebug is not something that we will ever officially<br>
support or make available. A variant of GrapheneOS with that kind of root<br>
access does not and will not exist. A variant with root access does exist:<br>
userdebug builds of GrapheneOS have stable releases and are fully<br>
supported. It isn’t what most of our users want and only a few people are<br>
actually using userdebug builds on their devices, but you cannot pretend<br>
that it doesn’t exist. I have multiple devices running userdebug builds of<br>
the most recent stable tag or of the development branch. My personal device<br>
for normal usage runs a user build and does not / will not have ADB access<br>
or other development options enabled either (ADB access is available in<br>
user builds, just not root access or bypassing whether apps have the debug<br>
flag set).</p>
<p>The build type wanted by the vast majority of GrapheneOS users on<br>
their devices (including myself) is a user build.  The vast majority of<br>
users (99.9%+) do not have any use case for a userdebug build and would<br>
never take advantage of it. In reality, it has very little use case aside<br>
from OS development. It isn’t needed for app development and would rarely<br>
ever be useful for that. People using userdebug builds would only serve to<br>
harm them, with very few exceptions. They are available as an option to<br>
people working on OS development or who want root access for some other<br>
reason including their religious beliefs about software and licensing, but<br>
those users are not typically interested in GrapheneOS in the first place<br>
and have largely worked to cause harm to GrapheneOS and the community by<br>
spreading misinformation and attacking it. I think it should be obvious why<br>
our official builds are the build type wanted by the vast majority of the<br>
GrapheneOS community. They would be upset if we only provided user builds.<br>
If we did provide userdebug builds, they would need to be signed with a<br>
different set of signing keys and those new verified boot keys would need<br>
to be added to Auditor and AttestationServer with ‘GrapheneOS insecure<br>
debug build’ shown as the OS instead of ‘GrapheneOS’. Root access could be<br>
used to bypass the attestation security model and the assurance provided by<br>
Auditor / AttestationServer would be lower without making sure there is no<br>
attached USB device and then forcing a hard reboot by holding the power<br>
button until the device forcibly shuts down. It’s important that people<br>
hold it long enough and do not get tricked by an attacker pretending to<br>
reboot, which is a serious problem with trying to use rebooting as a<br>
workaround for it. For example if you need to hold it for 10 seconds, the<br>
attacker can fake a reboot at 8 seconds and most people aren’t going to<br>
notice. Requiring a reboot for Auditor to work properly makes it<br>
substantially less usable and there isn’t a comparable workaround for<br>
AttestationServer since the whole point is opting into automatic scheduled<br>
verification instead of manual verification.</p>

<p>I don’t have any iota of interest in a religion/ideology built around<br>
software and software licensing. My experience with Free Software<br>
ideologues is that they’re dishonest, manipulative and have gone out of the<br>
way to cause harm to myself and GrapheneOS through spreading<br>
misinformation. You folks go out of the way to cause harm and do not think<br>
about things in a rational or reasonable way. The FSF is fine with<br>
proprietary firmware/hardware as long as it cannot be updated. If you<br>
prevent updating proprietary firmware, it doesn’t violate their rules. The<br>
entire OS could be treated as firmware that cannot be updated too,<br>
providing a completely locked down appliance with no security updates and<br>
which conforms to the FSF rules. That’s exactly the kind of path being<br>
taken by certain people to create a FSF approved mobile device. Sorry, but<br>
none of this makes any sense to me and is just a bunch of silly semantic<br>
games rather than anything to do with privacy, security or even user<br>
freedom. It’s not relevant to the real world and I’m not interested in a<br>
discussion based on irrational religious beliefs.</p>
<p>We officially support userdebug builds of GrapheneOS and you should not be<br>
claiming that we do don’t. We do not support persistent or app-accessible<br>
root and never will do that. The only form of root access that will ever be<br>
supported is temporary root access by the owner of the device until reboot<br>
on userdebug builds. We already provide this, and don’t pretend that it<br>
doesn’t have severe consequences. It makes no sense for people to pay the<br>
cost of those consequences when they aren’t ever going to use it and have<br>
no use case for it, which is why it’s limited to userdebug builds. We<br>
officially support it and it’s available + tested for each stable release.<br>
What you are claiming doesn’t add up at all. If you want us to provide<br>
official userdebug builds, provide the necessary funding for a workstation<br>
and server storage. You cannot reasonably complain that we do not offer<br>
them when you folks do not make it possible for us to offer them despite us<br>
wanting to do it. It is not my fault that the few people who want this are<br>
unwilling to support it. The vast majority of people do not want it and we<br>
cannot reasonably use their donations to provide it. It would not be what<br>
they donated to support. The tiny niche of people who want official<br>
userdebug builds would need to put together the resources for us to build<br>
and host the releases or stick to doing it themselves which a couple people<br>
are already doing. They are free to publish their builds for others. I’ve<br>
put in a huge amount of work to have an extremely well documented build<br>
process along with it being incredibly easy to deploy over-the-air updates<br>
including delta updates to minimize bandwidth usage. I’ve put a lot of work<br>
into writing and publishing scripts to make everything easier including<br>
managing signing keys encrypted with scrypt + AES, fully signing releases<br>
with those, etc. along with making sure builds are reproducible and fixing<br>
issues with that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You’re trying to misrepresent a userdebug as comparable to a fork or<br>
modification of the OS. It’s an official supported build variant of<br>
GrapheneOS. It uses exactly the same sources without any modification and<br>
does not have any negative network effect. The scale of the ‘project’ is<br>
non-existent since it already exists and officially supported. You just<br>
don’t like that it isn’t what most people want and don’t want to admit that<br>
it has serious downsides. We’re already having to consider dropping devices<br>
and scaling back aspects of the project even without doubling the amounts<br>
of builds. If the few people who want this won’t provide funding, how do<br>
you expect it to happen? Either people need to provide funding for us to do<br>
it or they need to do it themselves. It’s already officially supported and<br>
the only thing that needs to be done is building a debug variant of the<br>
entire OS for each supported device. I’d need a whole new local<br>
workstation/server support that without disrupting development and even<br>
then I’d still need to invest my time in building and maintaining another<br>
workstation and dealing with making these builds on it. I am willing to<br>
invest my time in that but I’m not spending a bunch of money building a<br>
powerful server to build a dozen extra builds of the OS in a reasonable<br>
amount of time.</p>
<p>Non-root enforcement is also similar to DRM. While DRM is about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>applications which don=E2=80=99t allow users to easily, freely copy data =<br>
on their<br>
own devices, non-root enforcement here leads to users not able to<br>
backup/copy/migrate their application data from one phone to another.<br>
Either the application has a backup / data export feature or data is<br>
=E2=80=9Ctrapped=E2=80=9D inside the phone. Even with a app dependent app=<br>
data backup<br>
feature, it=E2=80=99s better if users who choose so can get access to the=<br>
raw data<br>
stored by the app for convenience (not using tons of different data expor=<br>
t<br>
features rather than scripting backups, data export feature may be<br>
incomplete, analysis of app data by user).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you should educate yourself about Android including backup services,<br>
ADB and userdebug builds before making outlandish claims about it. AOSP and<br>
GrapheneOS have an official OS backup mechanism available via both ADB and<br>
backup services integrated into the OS. GrapheneOS includes Seedvault, but<br>
the backup functionality is available via ADB either way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-root enforcement also aids DRM enabled applications. If GrapheneOS<br>
gets more popular, perhaps picked up my phone manufacturers or resellers,<br>
mobile carriers it will be easy for application developers to utilize DRM=<br>
.<br>
To prevent the user from accessing application data. Making phone work in<br>
the interest of the application developer rather than phone user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fork of GrapheneOS signed with different keys is not GrapheneOS and is<br>
not something we can control short of not using the Free Software licenses<br>
that you hold so dear. The only solution to people forking the project and<br>
using it in ways that we don’t want is disallowing it in the licensing<br>
which you would be against. Do you want us to forbid commercial usage of<br>
the OS again?</p>
<p>It sounds like you have a problem with the consequences of truly free<br>
software which includes being able to turn it into proprietary software or<br>
using it to create locked down systems. That’s unlike non-free licenses<br>
like GPLv3 which forbid certain kinds of products. GPLv2-only licensing<br>
forbids mixing it with GPLv3 code. The license is incompatible with ITSELF.<br>
Linux kernel code cannot be included in GPLv3 projects. GPLv3 code cannot<br>
be included in the Linux kernel. That is a severe restriction freedom with<br>
serious real world consequences. The restrictions on freedom by the GPLv2<br>
and GPLv3 also prevent including the code in projects which cannot or will<br>
not make those concessions, so code that is locked up as GPLv2/GPLv3 cannot<br>
be sent back upstream to projects like OpenBSD. Forking permissively<br>
licensed code and locking it down as GPLv3 is something that I consider bad<br>
behavior and it’s certainly in opposition to wanting to be a good citizen<br>
and contributing whatever we can back upstream. OpenBSD considers GPL to be<br>
a non-free license and will not include GPLv2 code whenever they can avoid<br>
it. They absolutely will not ever include GPLv3 code as they consider it<br>
completely non-free. These definitions of freedom are very subjective and<br>
most of the world does not agree with your extreme ideological views.<br>
Freedom includes the freedom to make a locked down, highly secure device<br>
significantly more resistant to compromise. It includes the freedom to<br>
support and use features like verified boot, which is also counter to that<br>
ideology.</p>
<p>Software that moved to GPLv3 was entirely replaced nearly everywhere and<br>
most GPLv2 software other than Linux has better alternatives. Linux itself<br>
has horrible safety/robustness/security with no realistic way of fixing it<br>
and a trajectory headed for making it far worse over time, so incrementally<br>
or outright replacing it is important. That will be the end of the normal<br>
GPL licenses in most places. What’s the justification for the GPL<br>
restricting freedom when it hasn’t actually worked and has deterred people<br>
from using that software and driven them towards freer licenses like MIT?<br>
It sounds like you want an even more restricted license if you expect DRM<br>
to be forbidden. The only way of forbidding those things is restricting the<br>
freedom to do it like GPLv3 but actually beyond GPLv3 with clauses that<br>
would be incompatible with it since they’d have to go further… maybe that<br>
is exactly what the GPLv4 will do and even fewer people will use it, and it<br>
will drive people away from using GPLv2/GPLv3 even further just like GPLv3<br>
did to GPLv2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phone manufacturers or resellers, mobile carriers couldn=E2=80=99t be bla=<br>

</blockquote>
<p>A fork of GrapheneOS signed with different keys is not GrapheneOS so you<br>
are not talking about GrapheneOS anymore but rather something else not<br>
relevant to the discussion. I love the manipulative scare quotes around<br>
security even though the security issues it causes are very real and very<br>
impactful. It’s far more relevant than zero day exploitation for most users=<br>
.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1] But even the security vs user freedom view is a false dichotomy.<br>
Bootloaders allow for flexibility to boot into a root-enabled mode. There<br>
could be a key combination and/or boot menu which allows users to boot in=<br>
to<br>
root-enabled mode. There could be timeouts [user has to wait 5 seconds<br>
before proceeding a anti-root warning] / strong warnings. Booting into<br>
root-enabled mode could make subsequent boots into non-root enabled mode<br>
show a warning that the device may be compromised due to previous boot in=<br>
to<br>
root-enabled mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn’t a false dichotomy. I suggest reading through what I’ve written,<br>
doing your research and actually putting in some effort to understand the<br>
security model. There are already userdebug builds, i.e. a root enabled<br>
mode requiring enabling an option within the owner account AND having<br>
physical access to the device at the time that it’s used. It is ‘temporary’<br>
in that the option to use it remains available but the access itself goes<br>
away on reboot - but not whatever changes were made to persistent state<br>
using that access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question is rather, how much time/effort/money would be required to<br>
grant user freedom (root) in a secure way (such as alternative boot<br>
options)? If you were offered 1 million USD and had time, could you<br>
implement root access in a secure way? This is unrealistic and just and<br>
example to encourage imagination of solutions. Is this really a question =<br>
of<br>
unsolvable security issues vs user freedom? Or is it rather prioritizatio=<br>
n<br>
effort/time/money required to implement user freedom (root) vs other goal=<br>
s<br>
(just don=E2=80=99t prioritize on user freedom, make something work for n=<br>
ovice<br>
users, more quickly monetize (understood, we all need to eat)).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is already official support for userdebug builds in GrapheneOS.<br>
People are free to use those but it isn’t what the vast majority of the<br>
GrapheneOS community wants to use. It has hardly any use case aside from OS<br>
development. Give me 20k USD in funding and I will publish official<br>
userdebug builds signed with different keys alongside the regular releases<br>
for 2 years after I get the parts to build a new workstation/server, etc. I<br>
cannot do it without build hardware and server space for it. It could also<br>
just go on a separate update server.</p>

          <p>The argument got heated unfortunately and the <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Operating_System_Comparison" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mobile section</a> is outdated.</p>
<p>Although it is hosted at kicksecure now, the thread is here, so maybe better to continue here.</p>
<p>I know this is an old thread, but that page needs some reviews.</p>
<p>I could be a mediator (I use graphenos, but not a dev)… anyway, after two years nobody is angry anymore and possibly some stances have changed.</p>
<p>I’m not an android or mobile ps developer, just sharing what I know.</p>
<p>A lot of the points below are just simplifications of the post above, just to not repeat the same text and be more as a summary.</p>
<p>I will compare whonix design to gos to clarify to Patrick some points, although they are distinct systems and security features, I will use this method so it can be better understood, not that the options presented are equivalent.</p>
<p>So let’s see:</p>
<h2>
<a name="sections-separate-into-recommended-and-not-recommended-oses-1" class="anchor" href="#sections-separate-into-recommended-and-not-recommended-oses-1"></a>Sections: separate into recommended and not recommended OSes.</h2>
<p>Madaidam agrees for clarity.<br>
Patrick’s disagrees because it is just a page for listing mobile projects.<br>
I agree because I don’t think just mentioning OSes and some sources helps making a good decision, needs more detailed information.<br>
If grapheneos gives easy to use root, then attackers will have the same.</p>
<p>I would leave GrapheneOS, Android and Iphone on the recommended list for security. One can only be private if they are secure.</p>
<p>The rest of the projects I’d put then in the “avoid” section, as they do not implement modern security features, sometimes even disable it.</p>
<h3>
<a name="root-2" class="anchor" href="#root-2"></a>Root</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Argues that allowing users to gain root (superuser) access would inevitably break the security model and that there is no conceivable solution that can uphold both user security and freedom.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Potential <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Miscellaneous_Threats_to_User_Freedom#Conflict_of_Interest" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Conflict of Interest</a>. If GrapheneOS wouldn’t disable easy to use technical ways that most laymen users can use to gain root and/or to keep control over the software running on their devices, then GrapheneOS’s chances to be ever get a highly profitable hardware producer partnership would be severely diminished.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>User don’t need root and is very much recommended to not use it. Legacy applications required root to do things that now lesser privileged permissions can do.<br>
If root is allowed on the distributed build, then devices would be prone to a great variety of attacks.</p>
<p>Also userdebug builds mentioned by Daniel above, it takes development time and anyone can do it. Would be the same thing as asking to ship an I2P ws and gateway.</p>
<p>Just an example, lets do “s/root/netvm/g”<br>
AOSP user should use application without having root.<br>
Whonix user should use applications in the WS, without having control of the netvm.</p>
<p>AOSP user should use the user space for applications, and without root, they can not do nasty things, or even nastier.<br>
Whonix user should use the workstation space for applications, and without access to the gateway they are safe.</p>
<p>AOSP user needs to build to get root.<br>
Whonix user needs access to the gateway to change the gateway.</p>
<p>AOSP and Whonix are not restricting freedom, they are enforcing security, on AOSP Root through not adding it, and on Whonix through isolating the machines.</p>
<p>I understand that a Whonix user can edit the GW easily, and GOS root is not easy, needs build. But that is security stance.</p>
<h3>
<a name="verified-boot-3" class="anchor" href="#verified-boot-3"></a>Verified boot</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Full verified boot which would be great if the key would be held by users and encouraged through a first start process or similar instead of held by the developer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The user would need to sign build and sign the releases.<br>
But here is the thing, this is not a GOS issue, nor a AOSP issue, this is a feature that can be used by anyone that builds the program. GOS is using the verified boot but it needs a signing key and a repo distributor, and that is the project contributors.</p>
<p>On a linux desktop such as debian we only need to download a signing key and change a sources list entry, the same way that is easy, it is much worse for security.</p>
<p>So it is not restricting the user, they have build instructions <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://grapheneos.org/build" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Build | GrapheneOS</a>.<br>
Also, for AOSP, having an entry on the settings to add a new repo would be insufficient, someone has to sign firmware for verified boot to work.</p>

<p>Refusing root rights without user data wipe has many repercussions. From the table <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Operating_System_Comparison#iPhone_and_Android">iPhone and Android</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal storage can reasonably easily be removed and mounted elsewhere for the purpose of data recovery or hunting malware / rootkits. - No.</li>
<li>Internal storage can reasonably easily be decrypted once transferred to a different device if password is known.	 - No.</li>
<li>Can reasonably easily boot from external hard drive, ignoring internal harddrive for purpose of data recovery or hunting malware / rootkits.- No. But any Android phone currently has this issue.</li>
<li>Can reasonably easily create full data backup. No.</li>
<li>Applications cannot refuse data backup (for purpose of malware, spyware analysis or backup and restore). - No.</li>
<li>No culture of users can ask device (code) for permission and device (code) will decide to grant or refuse the request.	- No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investigation of any compromise without root is hindered. Not possible to create a full raw backup, boot, create another full raw backup and then compare the changes on the disk.</p>
<p>Without such essential freedoms easily accessible, I consider this a platform inherent security risk as a (high profile) user suspecting they’ve been compromised, cannot hand their device to anyone capable of malware investigation. The data isn’t accessible. The device locks out the user from their own data with no recourse.</p>

<p>In summary, you (Patrick)</p>
<ul>
<li>wish for root easily available as a boot mode or build distributed.</li>
<li>to have full control of the device, but as of now, requires you to build and sign, and that is how mobile systems works.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand GOS, AOSP:</p>
<ul>
<li>will not provide easy for because of many security issues, including breaking verified boot</li>
<li>breaking verified boot leads to malware persistence</li>
<li>full control of the device via should not be implemented for <em>distributed user builds</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The war on general purpose computing to make any user have root breaks the security model of AOSP.</p>
<p>Having control over everything is great, but that is for advanced users, there is no vendor locking from GOS, it is just not distributed with root as it is not suitable for users.</p>
<p>Also, the manual malware check of the device is not needed because of verified boot.<br>
So in the end, what remains, is full system backup for some unkown reason because malware changes are reverted on boot via verified boot and user data backup is enough to create the same user again.</p>
<ul>
<li>/root (system, vendor, oem) - cleaned on boot</li>
<li>/user_data (user space applications) - can be backed up</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know how malware inspection works on mobile, but with the verified boot, it greatly reduces the attack.</p>

Requires unlocking the bootloader, disabling verified boot.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. There is no hard technical requirement for that. Lower levels (such as firmware) and hands over control to the next level (such as bootloader). If any stage is broken, then verified boot is broken. The levels are approximately: hardware trust root → firmware → (shim -&gt;) (grub) bootloader → (linux) kernel  → kernel modules → initrd → (systemd) init.</p>
<p>For example, you can have verified boot SecureBoot (actually RestrictedBoot) on the Intel/AMD64 platform. Windows uses it.</p>
<p>As for Linux desktop distributions, I don’t think any offers full verified boot support yet. But that partial verified boot process is interesting to use an as example how this could be implemented. The firmware has a built-in key (by Microsoft). It verifies shim and if the signature checks out, it hands over control to shim. Next, shim verifies grub and hands over control to it. Next, grub verifies the kernel. Then it should verify the initrd but that’s not implemented in any Linux desktop operating system as far as I know. (Chromium OS …) That’s where the verified boot implementation stops for now.</p>
<p>So for most Linux desktop distributions currently the verified boot isn’t very useful. It’s a development progress start but it’s incomplete. The takeaway message is, that any level during the boot process can implement its own key management.</p>
<p>For example, on Linux systems using verified boot, users have to manually sign kernel modules so these can be load. But what does that tell us? That users can add their own keys which the Linux kernel accepts to verify kernel modules. There’s no need to add user custom key to the firmware just to load custom installed kernel module (such as the VirtualBox kernel module or LKRG).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Consider a design where the current way to implement verified boot is called the “the unbreakable stage1 verified boot”.</p>
<p>This stage1 verified boot (immutable, verity-protected, signed file system) could <code>verity</code> a stage2 image. If it’s modified it could report it and refuse to boot (unless some kernel parameter is set by user but this needs more description).</p>
<p>Similar to Android A/B (Seamless) System Updates concept where when the upgrade is supposedly atomic. If it fails, it reverts to the previous one. Two images. The old one and the new one. And these don’t break verified boot either.</p>
<p>This blog post goes into that direction: <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://0pointer.net/blog/fitting-everything-together.html" class="inline-onebox">Fitting Everything Together</a><br>
But while probably well intentioned, the “Developer Mode” described in that blog post could also lead to further user freedom restrictions.</p>
<p>At the moment the big surveillance corporate complex cannot yet lobby the governments to mandate that only big corporate signed full verified boot operating systems can boot. But if most devices are verified boot anyway and only a few Linux desktop computers remain while they’re one day also only available with full verified boot… At some point there’s not much devices left where general computing is possible without the approval (signature) of a third-party. And then a law mandating that only corporate signed full verified boot operating systems can boot becomes more likely.</p>

<p>I am referring to the following. It’s in the table, footnotes…</p>
<p>Quote <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#allowbackup" class="inline-onebox">&lt;application&gt;  |  Android Developers</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>android:allowBackup</code></p>
<p>Whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and restore infrastructure. If this attribute is set to false, no backup or restore of the application will ever be performed, even by a full-system backup that would otherwise cause all application data to be saved via adb. The default value of this attribute is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently on most Androids (which have verified boot + refuse root rights to the user), if an application is configured by the vendor <code>allowBackup=false</code>, then no backups are possible unless verified boot is broken and/or the device has been rooted.</p>
<p>If no backups are possible, then it’s also not possible to inspect the data. In essence, the app vendor gets a bit of private storage on the user’s device which the user cannot access.</p>
<p>Operating system and app vendors dictating such restriction to users is a bad direction to go specifically if more and more devices are already locked out the user in that way (most phones used my most users, smart TV, tables and whatnot) and are already developing towards that direction and the few remaining ones, which are desktop computers are already on the decline as well as going into the same direction. Referring to Intel/AMD64 platform with RestrictedBoot.</p>

<p>Also, the manual malware check of the device is not needed because of verified boot.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. Verified boot unfortunately isn’t a cure for all the security threats. If verified boot is broken, then it’s broken. Meaning, then malware can persist.</p>
<p>Any locked Android where the modding community managed to found a vulnerability to exploit it to free/unlock the bootloader is evidence that verified boot has been broken in past. To illustrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the modding community broke the bootloader then they did it to gain control over their hardware.</li>
<li>When <a href="../../../../external.html?link=https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Mobile_Phone_Security#Advanced_Mobile_Phone_Spyware">Advanced Mobile Phone Spyware</a> breaks verified boot / the bootloader, then they do this to spy on the user why at the same time keeping the user locked out from auditing. Malware uses technically similar methods to how the modding community sometimes archives unlocking of the bootloader. This then it invalidates any security advantages by verified boot. And that is then the worst of both worlds. Malware has the ability to spy on the user while the user still has no access ability to perform an audit of their device.</li>
</ul>
<p>User freedom and security auditing is crucial in security. Verified boot and locking the user out is “trust us”.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It mostly doesn’t. Security researchers have to invent complex hacks to get around the obfuscation and locks. Requires bootloader unlock. But if bootloader unlock isn’t possible without user data wipe then auditing is prevented. Here’s a research paper that briefly mentions research hurdles vs user locked-out bootloaders as well as the research methods.</p>

<p>Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reverse Engineering</p>
<p>A fairly substantial amount of non-trivial reverse engineering is generally required in order to decrypt messages and to at least partially decode the binary plaintext. 1) Handset Rooting: The first step is to gain a shell on the handset with elevated privileges, i.e. in the case of Android to root the handset. This allows us then to (i) obtain copies of the system apps and their data, (ii) use a debugger to instrument and modify running apps (e.g. to extract encryption keys from memory and bypass security checks), and (iii) install a trusted SSL root certificate to allow HTTPS decryption, as we explain below. Rooting typically requires unlocking the bootloader to facilitate access to the so-called fastboot mode, disabling boot image verification and patching the system image. Unlocking the bootloader is often the hardest of these steps, since many handset manufacturers discourage bootloader unlocking. Some, such as Oppo, go so far as to entirely remove fastboot mode (the relevant code is not compiled into the bootloader). The importance of this is that it effectively places a constraint on the handset manufacturers / mobile OSes that we can analyse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unbreakable verified boot + user locked out = no auditing possible for users. They are then only users, guests, non-administrators on their own devices.</p>
