    <title>Migrated old VMs and now display is black with mouse cursor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/migrated-old-vms-and-now-display-is-black-with-mouse-cursor/9664</link>
    <description>I used to run whonix gateway and workstation in virtualbox on macos. it worked fine.

i migrated to a nested setup under proxmox and now when booting the VMs with VirtualBox 6.1 I end up with a black screen with a x-windows mouse cursor.

I can switch to console and log in, but connection to tor is not established.

I have tried changing display settings. I had been used Videoram of 128MB and have experimented with 16MB and 64MB without change.

I was using VBOXvga previously, but have tried other options and the same result.

Any ideas how to get this going?</description>

<p>Whonix doesnâ€™t produce VirtualBox. The virtualizer VirtualBox is produced by <a href="http://virtualbox.org">virtualbox.org</a>. Unfortunately, we cannot support nested virtualization use cases here. These are far too uncommon and far too difficult to support.</p>
