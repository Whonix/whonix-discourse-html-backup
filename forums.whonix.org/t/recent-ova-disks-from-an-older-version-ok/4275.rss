    <title>Recent .ova + disks from an older version = Ok ?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/recent-ova-disks-from-an-older-version-ok/4275</link>
    <description>Hey I&#39;m back into Whonix after a while, I&#39;ve brought out the system disks I had back then, and now I&#39;m trying to rebuild my machines in VB.

Can I import images of Whonix 13 and then point them towards those disks ? They were Whonix 11 or 12 disks, I can&#39;t really remember.

I&#39;ve tried without importing images, just by pointing VB towards the folder where the VMs are, but no machine appears in the VMs list in VB (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s normal or if it is a matter of not enough privilege to access the content of that folder, it doesn&#39;t reside in the system disk. And empty list as well for sudo virtualbox + same folder path).

Host is Ubuntu 17.04 btw


EDIT: If machines are working right, and if my disks are from Whonix 11, then I first follow these steps
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_11_to_Whonix_12
and then these

right ?</description>

            <p>Okay, it went rather well. Making the .ova and disks files work together just needed a bit of editing of the VirtualBox.xml file and fiddling with the Virtual Media Manager, and then all was ok.</p>
<p>I then followed the steps needed for an upgrade to v.13, and I seem to have succeeded.<br>
Whonixcheck displays all green lights and sanity checks results are fine, but how can I be sure that I really succeeded ?</p>
<p>-Whonix packages dependencies are version 3.4.2-1, that’s good?<br>
-One thing I’m not sure about: the repository for updates is the Jessie repository, should it be that one ?<br>
-Is there something else I need to run or test to verify that I’m all good ?</p>
<p>(Actually, I was like sure that it was going to fail, after one year and a half without having touched Whonix. And now, the simplicity and smoothness of how it went is just making me doubtful that all is really in order.)</p>
