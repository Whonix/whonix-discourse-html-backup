            <p>Hi <code>HowToDoThis</code></p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. Is your hardware compatible?</p>

<p>Did you search qubes-users (google groups) to see if this has been brought up before?</p>
<p>I saw you ask this same question on multiple forums with no responses. This same question (almost exact) is asked in multiple forums <em>and</em> answered. My point is don’t wait for an answer. Perhaps a solution can be found as per: <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle</a></p>
<p>Or maybe not if your hardware is not compatible. Regardless, this is not whonix related</p>

    As a rule of thumb: 

Everything that happens “inside” the virtual machines is Qubes-Whonix and belongs into this sub forum.
Everything that happens “outside” the virtual machine is Qubes and the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/help/" rel="nofollow noopener">Qubes help</a> should be consulted.


Some examples: 

EFI -&gt; <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/" rel="nofollow noopener">Qubes support</a>

Errors by by Qubes VM Manager (QVMM) -&gt; <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/" rel="nofollow noopener">Qubes support</a>

libvirtError -&gt; <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/" rel="nofollow noopener">Qubes support</a>

Issues that also apply to Debian based VMs. -&gt; <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/" rel="nofollow noopener">Qubes support</a>
