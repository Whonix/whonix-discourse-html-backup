    <description>Hi, I receive a Network Time Synchronization failed error when I start up a new AppVM based on whonix-gw-experimental in Qubes 3.0 rc2.  The following is a printout from the terminal of sdwdate.log:

This is the first time I am trying whonix and the install was based on the instructions at https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Binary_Install#First_time_user.3F (which by the way were excellent!).  I was also able to update the templates without any errors.  I believe that I have everything setup pursuant to the article (below is the experimental setup):

Template: whonix-gw-experimental with NetVM: sys-whonix-gw-exp

AppVM: whonix-exp-app01 with NetVM: sys-whonix-gw-exp

ProxyVM: sys-whonix-gw-exp with NetVM: sys-firewall


I have the same issue with my AppVM based on whonix-ws. Here is sdwdate.log

Type: &quot;whonix&quot; &lt;enter&gt; for help.
user@host:~$ sudo service tor restart
[ ok ] Restarting tor (via systemctl): tor.service.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Thank you Patrick for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>I’m currently running Qubes 3.0 rc2</p>
<p>Looking at the steps to upgrade, I think I’ll wait until Whonix 11 <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The steps you provided do not work.  However, so as to not waste your time we do not need to spend any more time on this.  I don’t mind waiting until Whonix 11.  I provide the following just as an FYI.</p>
<p>The sudo systemctl enable control-port-filter-python returns a “Failed  to issue method call: No such file or directory”.  The first two lines of code worked and I have control-port-filter-python sitting in my Home directory. (yes I am running it in the template)</p>
<p>I tried running sudo service control-port-filter-proxy status in the proxy and it returns an unrecognized service (which makes sense since the above did not work).</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Richard</p>

            <p>The short user centric answer is:<br>
You can ignore this for now, because time synchronization is broken anyhow. Will be fixed with Whonix 12.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>The contributor centric answer is… A lot stuff you can try…</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade to Qubes Q3 RC1. That’s what I am working with at the moment.</li>
<li>Upgrade to Whonix 11: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_10_to_Whonix_11#Upgrading">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_10_to_Whonix_11#Upgrading</a>
</li>
<li>or wait until Whonix 11 is released (announcement through usual channels) which is hopefully very soon</li>
<li>time synchronization will still not work as expected then (dom0 interfering with it)</li>
<li>check what whonixcheck says</li>
</ul>
<p>In TemplateVM:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>You can also try the following command which I currently test to make time synchronization work in Qubes. (Prevent Qubes dom0 from syncing Whonix VMs clock.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>In ProxyVM (gateway):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Then the ControlPort should be accessible.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
