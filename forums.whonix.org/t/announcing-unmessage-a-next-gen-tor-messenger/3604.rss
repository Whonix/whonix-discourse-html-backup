    <title>Announcing unMessage: a Next-Gen Tor Messenger</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/announcing-unmessage-a-next-gen-tor-messenger/3604</link>
    <description>&lt;small&gt;Originally published at:			https://www.whonix.org/blog/announcing-unmessage-next-gen-tor-messenger
		&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;unMessage is an anonymous messenger that uses Tor to hide metadata of participants. Its still in early development, however a major new feature such as Tor-to-Tor audio chat (the first such implementation we are aware of) has been included. Major additions like file-sharing support, video conferencing and a portable code-base for mobile platforms are planned.

Their major goal is to provide a better UX and a competitive feature set to move users away from proprietary solutions that don&#39;t respect privacy. Its not ready for mass adoption yet, so only the more technical audience among you should go ahead try it out. Feedback and/or pull requests are highly appreciated.
