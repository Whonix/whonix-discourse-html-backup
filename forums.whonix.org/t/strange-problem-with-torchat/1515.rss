    <title>Strange problem with Torchat</title>

    <description>Hi there!

I have a strange problem with Torchat.

1. When I first installed it - everything was fine. But then, when I closing the laptop lid and leaving the sleep mode when active Virtual Machines (Gateway and Workstation) - Torchat stops working (no connection). I tried everything from restarting virtual machines and host machine - to debagging.

Everything works fine, logs show me no problem, but Torchat still have no connection.

It helps to re-install only the &quot;pure&quot; Whonix - then Torchat works.

It is the cause of the problems in sleep mode - I don&#39;t know, but the correlation is. The same problem at my buddy.

2. I tried to install the Pidgin and Torchat plugin. But it is not possible to copy the plug-in (libpurpletorchat.so) in to the folder / usr / lib / purple-2 - is not have a access/rights. I even tried to load Workstation as root at the command line and use the command -f c, No results. Even Su does not help.

At the end I setup Torchat on the host machine (Win) and it works fine.

I understand that the use Torchat on the host machine is not a good idea, so I decided to write a question on the forum.

Thanks in advance!</description>

            <p>Are you sure just Torchat doesn’t work anymore or no internet in Whonix works anymore?<br>
Do connections to other hidden services still work?</p>
<p>The problem is that the clock within the VM gets out of sync, which confuses Tor. See also:<br>

<p>Manually fix the clock. Or restart the gateway. Or the gateway and the workstation. Or don’t use sleep mode.</p>
