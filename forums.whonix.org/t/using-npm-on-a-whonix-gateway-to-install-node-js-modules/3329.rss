    <title>Using NPM on a Whonix Gateway to install node.js modules</title>

    <description>**edit**: _I got it all working....because installing the server on the gateway is NOT what you&#39;re supposed to do. The server is on the workstation and everything is working proper. I could not have been more wrong about my approach if I tried. I&#39;ll leave the URL up for a bit just in case if anyone wants to see (lol..)._

I am trying to deploy a test hidden service site on the TOR network through my Whonix Gateway in Virtual Box that just says &quot;Hello World!&quot; when you visit the .onion url. I have succeeded in this task using PHP and Lighttpd; it was a breeze. I now want to do it with Node.js. The problem that I am facing is that NPM doesn&#39;t work when trying to install modules via the terminal, such as _npm install express_. Has anyone gotten this to work? I have been all over the net trying to find guidance but this question is the first of its kind and my personal efforts haven&#39;t worked at all. I know that manual methods of module installation exist, but managing numerous modules manually is just not feasible with huge projects.

Below is am image of the issue.

            <ul>
<li>
<p>Its Tor not TOR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If whatever you’re doing involves installing things on the Gateway then you are doing it wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>node.js is infamous for having shitty security - downloads and updates don’t even have basic security last I checked.</p>
</li>
