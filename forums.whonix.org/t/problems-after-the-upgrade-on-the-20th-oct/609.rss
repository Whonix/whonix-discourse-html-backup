    <title>Problems after the upgrade on the 20th Oct</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-after-the-upgrade-on-the-20th-oct/609</link>
    <description>Just upgraded, and found 2 small problems.

1. The number pad located on the right side of the keyboard won&#39;t work.

2. Arm monitor on the gateway showed tor disconnected after the upgrade, and had to press &quot;r&quot; to reconnect.

Just to make sure if these are normal? :)</description>

<p>Dunno.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Tor receives an upgraded (by Debian or The Tor Project repositories) then it is restarted as part of the upgrade process. Arm loosing connection is expected then.</p>
