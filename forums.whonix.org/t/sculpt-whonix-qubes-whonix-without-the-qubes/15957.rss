    <description>[quote=https://genode.org/about/challenges#Virtualization]Qubes OS is a desktop operating system that follows the principle of security through compartmentalization. In spirit, it is closely related to Genode. In contrast Genode&#39;s clean-slate approach of building a fine-grained multi-component system, Qubes employs Xen-based virtual machines as sandboxing mechanism. In version 3.0, Qubes introduced a Hypervisor Abstraction Layer, which decouples Qubes from the underlying virtualization platform. This exploration project pursues the goal of replacing Xen by Genode as virtualization layer for Qubes.[/quote] 

Since Qubes and Genode both utilize a network of sandboxed virtual containers each running its own operating system, I&#39;m toying with the idea of replacing Qubes OS with Sculpt OS (Genode&#39;s flagship) as the host for the Whonix gateway and workstation. Has anyone tried this before? Is there a reason why it shouldn&#39;t be done?</description>
