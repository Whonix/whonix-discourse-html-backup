    <title>Can&#39;t connect to VPS on workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/cant-connect-to-vps-on-workstation/998</link>
    <description>Hi, after recent whonix-gateway update I can&#39;t connect to any of my VPS. I&#39;m trying to connect from WinXP (workstation) through Remote Desktop Connection and UltraVNC. Before update everything was working great, I had no problems with connection. Since the update (tor-geoip-something), I got this notice in whonix-gateway terminal:
&quot;We tried for 15 seconds to connect to &#39;[scrubbed]&#39; using exit $manyrandomnumbersandletters-nodename at IP.IP.IP.IP. Retrying on a new circuit.&quot;

Beside that internet connection works fine on different applications in workstation, the only thing that doesnt work is UltraVNC and Remote Desktop Connection.

How can I fix this?</description>

            <p>Port scan run in Whonix-Workstation - if you did that - scans the Tor exit, not your machine.</p>
<p>Port scan of remote servers through Tor is not simple and I won’t be helping with that [for reasons unrelated to you]. Using one VPN of yours to scan another VPS seems easier/better.</p>
<p>Why does e-mail work… That’s kinda networking basics. The easy answer is… For one, webmail doesn’t use the pop/imap/smtp port. Another thing… For reaching open listening/server ports on a remote machine the accessing machine doesn’t need any open incoming/server ports. Not in that sense. See also [random] source port vs destination port and this:</p>

            <p>Sorry for late reply, I was offline for couple days. But this issue is the only thing that I can think about right now. I need to solve this.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.portcheckers.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portcheckers.com</a> I run some test, I’ve tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>whx-gateway+whx-workstation (only opened ports were 80 &amp; 443)</li>
<li>whx-gateway+winxp-workstation (22 &amp; 80)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve never checked which ports are opened, and which are blocked because everything was working great, till last week. So now I wonder, why on winxp-wrk I can’t access any of my VPS through SSH on port 22, which is clearly opened? Also why I can send emails even when all “email” ports are blocked? And how can I finally access my VPS through RDP on port 3389?</p>

That's sufficient. Sure you also enabled a server listener on these ports?

ssh works for me.

Plain debian wheezy + system Tor from torproject's apt repository.

<p>I’ve even installed Debian as a workstation, configured internal connection, and tried couple different RDP/VNC clients, none of them work, I’ve got the same notice in arm. So it’s not the Windows fault.</p>

            <p>It just could be a coincidence. Not the cause. Unlikely, but perhaps there is no more Tor exit, that allows/is capable to let you exit on that port? Can you try on another port?</p>
<p>For diagnosis, you could try to downgrade to earlier version and see if it works then. Unfortunately, downgrades don’t come without risk.</p>
<p>You need to somehow nail the cause of this. Perhaps getting Whonix out of the equation and reproduce so a bug could be reported against upstream. Otherwise it’s unlikely to get such super strange issues fixed.</p>

            <p>My application is build-in Remote Desktop Connection on WinXP which is on default settings using TCP 3389 port, which couple days ago was working great. Other similar programs also can’t connect.</p>
<p>Not even one packet is going through on workstation side, in arm terminal I got new notice every 15 seconds:<br>
“We tried for 15 seconds to connect to ‘[scrubbed]’ using exit $manyrandomnumbersandletters-nodename at IP.IP.IP.IP. Retrying on a new circuit.”</p>
<p>over and over and over…</p>
<p>It’s ridiculous, because I didn’t changed anything, beside doing that update, and now it seems completely dead.</p>

            <p>No idea.</p>
<p>I find it unlikely - not impossible - that any upgraded on the gateway caused this or that removal of any packages would help.</p>
<blockquote>How can I check if it persists?</blockquote>
If you still have the issue now, then definition "problem does still exists" is fulfilled.
<blockquote>How can I check that? UDP or TCP?</blockquote>
That is specific to your application. Check your application settings/documentation for UDP vs TCP. Use TCP, because the Tor network does not support UDP. (Unless this hack... https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnel_UDP_over_Tor)

            <p>Maybe not that particular package cause this, I think there was at least two other packages upgraded during that update.</p>
<p>How can I check if it persists?</p>
<p>I’ve been using six different VPS from different providers, none of them work on any workstation right now. I’ve tried WinXP, Win7 also. I’ve downloaded newset whonix-gateway also, updated&amp;upgraded, and it’s the same.<br>
I’ve connected with no problem through VPN that have TOR connection available. So access from TOR it’s not an issue here.</p>
<p>How can I check that? UDP or TCP?</p>
<p>I don’t know, because I have no idea what packages I need to remove.</p>

<p>Does it persist?</p>
<p>You sure it’s not the server which is offline? Tried any other servers?</p>
