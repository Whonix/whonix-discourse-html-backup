    <title>KDE Display Manager doesnt start! (enough RAM)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kde-display-manager-doesnt-start-enough-ram/1341</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am for a very long time a happy Whonix User.
I was using Whonix Gateway 9 until today with VMWare Workstation 11 and some custom VMs as Workstations. (Host System is Windows 7 x64)
Everything was always working fine.

However, now I wanted to change to Whonix Gateway 11, but unfortunately its not working properly.
Although I have enough RAM assigned to the VM (1GB), the KDE Display Manager doesnt start!

The Whonix Gateway itself in console mode seems working! Lets say first: Its only the KDM that doesnt work or start somehow...

That last two lines (starting with &quot;[INFO]&quot;) were just showing for a half second. As I remember from Whonix 9 there should be actually some more load time.
However, it says it would start KDM, but it doesnt really.

Thats the next what was showing to me. (That &quot;host login:&quot;-line seems also to be unusual, because there is no line break...?)

Can you please tell me how to fix this KDM Problem?

Is there a way to start KDM manually from the console?

Would be awesome if you could help me with this Problem :(

Btw, this Project is f*cking awesome! Keep it up!</description>

            <p>VMware (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VMware">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VMware</a>) is unsupported. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#What_do_you_mean_by_unsupported.3F">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#What_do_you_mean_by_unsupported.3F</a>)</p>
<p>I don’t think this problem is caused by rads (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter</a>) or too less RAM.</p>
<p>Log into to a virtual console (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles</a>). Try manually starting it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Will probably not work. Maybe this is caused by some incompatibility since Whonix 10 (Debian 7 wheezy based) to Whonix 11 (Debian 8 jessie based).</p>
<p>Check out xorg log. Try also if Debian jessie / KDE works in VMware.</p>
