    <title>Whonix on bootable OS + a couple of other questions</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-on-bootable-os-a-couple-of-other-questions/371</link>
    <description>Hello. I&#39;ve been reading on Whonix and how it works etc. I don&#39;t have profound IT knowledge so please speak in laymanish.

So I would like to have a USB stick with a host OS and Whonix on it. Of what I understand this is quite doable. 
Question 1: If I boot this USB stick on a machine that is running Windows or say, a public pc or just anything that hasn&#39;t been secured - could this compromise my anonymity and my bootable OS? 

Question 2: Can you please recommend a Linux OS that would be most suitable for this purpose? I am looking at Xubuntu, but actually I have no clue. The bootable OS with Whonix would be a Whonix dedicated system.

Thanks</description>

Unless there is a hardware backdoor such as a hardware keylogger and/or miniature camera etc. this is fine. So I’d be careful using public computers.</p>
<p>A computer that you haven’t used for something else before in theory is safer - since hardware compromise is less likely. I don’t know how theoretic that is.</p>
