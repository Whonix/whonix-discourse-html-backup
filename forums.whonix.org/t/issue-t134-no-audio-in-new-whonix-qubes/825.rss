    <description>[b]Issue T134: Audio Sometimes Not Working in Qubes

Posted by @WhonixQubes

February 5, 2015

https://phabricator.whonix.org/T134[/b]

&lt;blockquote&gt;Audio output is sometimes not working in Qubes.

Experienced in both Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway.

When audio is working, the &quot;Attach/Detach audio-input to the VM&quot; option is enabled for the VM in the Qubes Manager.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[hr]


I just tried playing a video in Whonix on a Qubes R2 system that I know has good audio coming out of it.

Unsuccessful. No audio came out of the Whonix Workstation VM for me. Unmodified original VM.

Tested using ITL compiled Whonix-Workstation 2.1.7-201412012203.

[b]Has it been confirmed by anyone that audio output works in the new Whonix Qubes?[/b]



FYI: No audio was also an unresolved issue in the old Whonix HVM port...

https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,590.0.html

It was reported with the old system that audio worked in Debian Wheezy HVMs but not Whonix HVMs.</description>

<p>Awesome that you got this bug. And really cool about the configuration setup GUI. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>It’s not a major personal priority for me right now, so no need to trouble yourself, since I’ve got a more important backlog to take care of first on completing the leak testing, documentation, and announcement of our new platform.</p>
<p>Could you write up here what the exact technical problem was and what the fix was. And I will close the issue ticket with that information.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I can confirm <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/qubonix">@Qubonix</a>’s experience of having audio output work randomly.</p>
<p>When audio is working, the “Attach/Detach audio-input to the VM” option is enabled for the VM in the Qubes Manager.</p>
<p>This occurs the same way for both Whonix-Workstation and Whonix-Gateway.</p>
<p>I have not seen audio output go from on to off, or vice versa, while a live VM is running. So it may be with some kind of VM startup issue. But I haven’t spent a lot of time confirming this behavior.</p>

I have it on my list of things to look in to.  Audio does work for the regular Debian templates which I use daily.</p>
<p>Does audio not work for you in both the Gateway and Workstation or just Workstation?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for working on this!</p>
<p>Interesting to know about audio working on your Debian templates. This seems to be mirroring the same issue with audio working on Debian HVMs but not on Whonix HVMs.</p>
<p>Good question about Workstation vs Gateway… My test was just on the Workstation. I will have to get back to you on the Gateway. As my primary machine does not have audio hardware and I will have to check this on a test machine.[/quote]</p>
<p>I found some issues with the wheezy template as well.  I am using the jessie one.  I think I fixed it for 9.6 release.</p>

I can confirm that I can get audio in the WhonixVM based on nrgaways template, but it is random. Most of them time audio won’t work, and other times it will.</p>
<p>You can tell if audio is working if the “Attach/Detach audio-input to the VM” is able to be toggled.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Interesting problem. Thanks for your report, Qubonix.</p>
<p>A potential bug indeed. I wonder if it is machine specific or pervasive for all Whonix Qubes templates.</p>
<p>I also wonder if audio is consistently working on <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/nrgaway">@nrgaway</a>’s generic Debian 7 template.</p>
<p>As mentioned, in the old HVM setup, audio was working in Debian HVMs but not Whonix HVMs.</p>
<p>So maybe an audio conflict between Whonix packages and Qubes.</p>
<p>We will have to get to the bottom of this.[/quote]</p>
