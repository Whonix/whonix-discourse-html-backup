Is it possible still to go then out with the normal ISP IP from client? Maybe with a Proxy authentication? I do play some online games and want still play them (yes I will try that with Whonix-Workstation)<br>
[/quote]<br>
Possible in theory, but in practice it is neither researched nor documented how to do this with Whonix-Gateway.[/quote]</p>
<p>Opensource is the key for the win, I will look for a solution</p>

            <p>Ok thx for your help, will look how to get some Ethernet Ports for my Raspberry and then I will start that.<br>
But one question still exist: Is it possible still to go then out with the normal ISP IP from client? Maybe with a Proxy authentication? I do play some online games and want still play them (yes I will try that with Whonix-Workstation)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mhhh Whonix-Gateway as router?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see. The definition “router” is too ambiguous. My idea was, that you go online with a standard device (adsl router / 3g stick / etc.) which is connected to Whonix-Gateway. Then connect all devices through Whonix-Gateway. Looks way simpler to me than “all devices connected to RP, which decides to forward a few connections to Whonix-Gateway”.</p>
<blockquote>Is that hard to configure?</blockquote>
Whole computer stuff Linux is imho very hard and not really user friendly.
<blockquote>I am not at home, but i thought I can disable the whole internet but for accepted clients.</blockquote>
Devices would have to somehow authenticate themselves. Using ARP spoofing defense, ssh or vpn. (The https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Connections_between_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation page is related, similar.)
This is more like a general linux / router config question. I haven't done this yet.
<blockquote>So I should better connect the raspberry to the router and all devices to the raspberry?</blockquote>
Yes. Installing Whonix-Gateway on RP is another challenge. For one you need two network interfaces. Then follow physical isolation instructions. (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation) There was an older forum thread about RP (http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/30381157/).
<blockquote>But that the Gateway can have much ProxyServer's with different node's, did I see that rigth?</blockquote>
Yes, see:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstations
<blockquote>Android is anyway a whole trojan, but my girlfriend wana use it and she have all google &amp; facebook shit on her phone. So I am very interesting for that [b]Stream Isolation[/b].</blockquote>
Stream isolation / Tor has less value when one logs into accounts, that know your name anyway. However, you get location privacy. And more harsh account verification requests, of course. See also:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstations
<blockquote>pps: (ach cool du kommst aus leipzig? da ziehe ich auch bald hin :) )</blockquote>
Ja. Cool.

Android devises are usually connected by wifi, not physical lan cable. Once a device is compromised, they can jump onto any other available wifi.[/quote]</p>
