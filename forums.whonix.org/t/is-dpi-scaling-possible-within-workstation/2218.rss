    <title>Is DPI scaling possible within Workstation?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/is-dpi-scaling-possible-within-workstation/2218</link>
    <description>I have a QHD display. I have enabled VirtualBox Guest Additions. It works fine, desktop is shown in native resolution. However as usual, everything is too small on it. if I change the scale-factor in host&#39;s VirtualBox, then chars are fuzzy. In Windows and in Ubuntu there are ways to use DPI scaling. I have checked at System settings / Hardware / Display and monitor, but I can&#39;t find this setting there. I have checked https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Higher_Screen_Resolution, but it is for without GA. 

Can I somehow change the DPI scaling within WS, if Guest Additions are enabled?

Thanks</description>

            <p>KDE that is used by Debian stable (which Whonix is based on) does to my<br>
knowledge unfortunately not support DPI scaling.</p>
