    <description>Hi,

After some routine updates to Discourse, I identified some quirky regressions regarding the category logos and the header logo.

The category logo size issue is [confirmed](https://meta.discourse.org/t/after-2-2-0-beta-5-update-category-logos-are-now-big/103385/3) as an upstream regression and so we await a fix to land in the next release.

The header logo issue is another one of those onion-hostility changes that relates to forcing &#39;https&#39; in the protocol, and absolute rather than relative URLs. If I switch on &#39;force_https&#39; mode, I break the onion service entirely I think.

Nonetheless I was able to workaround both with some custom CSS and Nginx tweaks, so you hopefully don&#39;t notice much if anything has changed.

There may be other (minor) impacts related to logo image sizes, other cases of assets being referenced via absolute URLs and its impact on .onion, though probably (hopefully) not. But I thought I&#39;d get on the front foot by saying the usual disclaimer - please avoid making new topics about it or expecting any magic fixes due to Whonix budget constraints, as it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;ll be able to do much. 

When Discourse fixes the image issue upstream, I can remove my custom CSS tweaks and then I&#39;ll bin this post.

Obviously if you encounter massive show-stopping problems using the forums, let Patrick know. But the fact that I can add this post indicates things are basically fine.

Happy new year folks..</description>

It provides functionality that is impossible with plain HTML and is a better alternative than turds like Flash. Discourse is infinitely better than the buggy php stack that was before it.</p>
<p>We do take precautions and privde the most secure ways possible to access the forums whether through an onion or via clearnet with a Let’s Encrypt cert. In the case of the latter, no MITM will go unreported thanks to transparency.</p>

<p>Yes this seems to work for those projects. To he honest though, I use Qubes but don’t use the mailing list very often. Mostly because of usability - its always a trade off. Maybe I’m just spoiled with Whonix forums.</p>
<p>Tails used to have a support forum. So I actually see Tails mailing list as a regression of sorts.</p>

<p>Hows that related to whonix forum security while you said “malicious JS can be injected by an exit node, with SSL certificate issues” ? but its as i said it emphasis risk on the user.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Javascript is risky:</p>
<ol>
<li>It assists advanced fingerprinting techniques.</li>
<li>It assists browser exploits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Javascript on innocent, well meaning sites is still risky, because the risk of the content being tampered with by a third party is always there. <strong>If the content is tampered with when the browser is set to block JS, the potential damage to the user is lower than when JS is allowed</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s why blocking JS (on any site, <strong>even our own site</strong>) is certainly safer security-wise. Regarding fingerprinting, there are arguments to both sides (most users do not block JS so doing that puts one in a smaller group), but in my opinion the advanced fingerprinting allowed by JS is a greater threat than being in a smaller group. And, to the very least, the user needs to have the option of making the decision.</p>
<p>How can third parties inject Javascript to innocent sites?</p>
<ul>
<li>By modifying the content on the server (hack)</li>
<li>By modifying the content of a component that gets updated</li>
<li>By using MITM (Man in the middle) attacks</li>
</ul>
<p>What are MITM attacks, in this context?</p>
<ul>
<li>Tor exit node injecting content into the requested page</li>
<li>Someone on your network that does ARP redirection injecting content to the requested pages (not possible with Tor?)</li>
<li>Any remote scripts used getting revised by above methods or others</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn’t SSL protect against tamper attempts? only to a certain extent. SSL can be stripped (user redirected to a non-SSL site). Or the MITM uses a different SSL certificate. Certificates can be forged or stolen. Or the CA (Certificate Authority) is malicious to begin with or otherwise compromised.</p>

            <p>Just reading the forums can already be achieved without JS, and while using the highest level of TBB security level. So, we distrust the infrastructure and <strong>can take the means to protect ourselves</strong> (at least to a certain extent) while browsing the forums.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What does it mean to “distrust the infrastructure”?</p>
<p>A core tenet of the Qubes philosophy is “distrust the infrastructure,” where “the infrastructure” refers to things like hosting providers, CDNs, DNS services, package repositories, email servers, PGP keyservers, etc. As a project, we focus on securing endpoints instead of attempting to secure “the middle” (i.e., the infrastructure), since one of our primary goals is to free users from being forced to entrust their security to unknown third parties. Instead, our aim is for users to be required to trust as few entities as possible (ideally, only themselves and any known persons whom they voluntarily decide to trust).</p>
<p>Users can never fully control all the infrastructure they rely upon, and they can never fully trust all the entities who do control it. Therefore, we believe the best solution is not to attempt to make the infrastructure trustworthy, but instead to concentrate on solutions that obviate the need to do so. We believe that many attempts to make the infrastructure appear trustworthy actually provide only the illusion of security and are ultimately a disservice to real users. Since we don’t want to encourage or endorse this, we make our distrust of the infrastructure explicit.</p>

<p>Why do you use GitHub? (<em>Could be changed to “Why use Discourse?”</em>)</p>
<p>Three main reasons:</p>

<li>It’s free (as in beer). We’d have to spend either time or money to implement a solution ourselves or pay someone to do so, and we can’t spare either one right now.</li>
<li>It has low admin/overhead requirements, which is very important, given how little time we have to spare.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Admin/overhead of Discourse (is ?) vs. What forum software did you say has lower Admin/overhead? better security?  Works with onions? Will not have any/other problems not currently experienced on <a href="http://whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix.org</a>?</p>
<p>A knee jerk reaction would be so assume that none of your concerns have been brought up or considered before. But just like everyone else you claim to have the answer but aren’t will to help move <a href="http://whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix.org</a> in that direction. For starters this might include</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding suitable forum software to migrate to. Meaning requires low resources, low admin overhead. Tor/.onion compatible, no Java Scirpt…</li>
<li>Testing this platform for whonix developers/sysadmin</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyday whonix deveopers have countless ideas brought  to them by the good idea fairy but no one is willing to lift a finger to help. So my question:</p>
<p>If this i so important to you what would you be willing to do to make it happen. I mean if I want something done on <a href="http://whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix.org</a> <strong>I have to take the initiative</strong> Although a very corny and cliche,  “Talk is cheap actions speak”  applies here.</p>

</aside>
<p>Who told you that Whonix forum is not simple and stable and not secure? (you need proof on this claim)</p>
<p>Just because there is JS , doesnt make the forum magically malware. We dont recommended JS because it MAY emphasis a risk on the user because it can be used to in ways to harm users IF its used wrongly like similar what is been done by horrible companies like Google or Microsoft or Cloudflare …etc.</p>
<p>Also to attract the new users to know how to interact easily with our forum it NEEDS to be shiny and nice looking (because geeks dont care about shiny stuff like the average users).</p>
<p>And there is other channel Whonix provide inside whonix-workstation like IRC chat that is fully torrified.</p>
<p>What else? We have social media accounts only accessible while using Tor + free JS and we already have mentioned that in our social media list: (specially Galaxy3)</p>

<p>Just imagine you chose Fedora rather than Debian as a base Distro for Whonix. Imagine the headaches you’d face with a distro that tries to be cutting edge rather than stable. In the same way, and while there are no guarantees, I think forum software for this project should place emphasis on simplicity and stability. Updates - mostly (or only) for security reasons rather than shiny features. I am not an expert on that. I just hope people keep an open mind to study the options.</p>

forum software since any upgrades by the forum software could break this<br>
feature leading to chase yet another forum software.</p>

<p>A knee jerk reaction and invalid / not-applicable when moving from a resource-draining platform to a simpler one actually <strong>makes more sense in a limited funding and manpower project</strong>.</p>
<p>Same automatic response was given about Whonix having to stay with KDE. And here, magically, we have XFCE which will actually save development resources in the future.</p>
<p>I am sure Whonix will eventually move away from Discourse. The only question is how many more hours to spend (down the drain) until the decision is made.</p>
<p>Now not only we have to allow JS, we also have to set security level to minimal to interact on the forum? others would raise eyebrows.</p>

</aside>
<p>Limited resources is <em>one</em> of the issues that prevents changing to a different platform. Regardless of which platform Whonix uses some/many of the same problems will be encountered. Not only that but moving to an new platform will bring new problem.</p>
<p>It might sound good but its not that easy. Plus there might not be any interest by Whonix developers atm.</p>

<p>Hi <code>kasuvus</code></p>
<p><em>If</em> we made the decision to do this would you be willing help with the transition? Meaning, we are low on human resources and we would need to find someone that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would stick around for a while so we could get to know you</li>
<li>Could find and test a suitable platform and would conduct all the required testing.</li>
<li>Has the required knowledge to move all fourm data to the new platform. Must not break anything such as forum links etc</li>
<li>Would assist our current sysadmin with bug reports, patches etc…</li>
<li>Would be willing to do this free of charge.</li>
<li>Likely other things as brought up by lead developer, sysadmin.</li>

After the recent Discourse upgrade by the sysadmin some of the widgets do not render when Tor Browser is set to highest security level. For example, to “like” a post or edit a post  is not visible. 
This is not a Whonix issue, this is a Tor browser/Discourse issue so Whonix developers have no control over this. I will see if I can  find any bug reports on this and maybe a solution. If not I will submit a bug report. 
To clarify: 
Before the Discource upgrade I was able to click on the …

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>After some routine updates to Discourse, I identified some quirky regressions regarding the category logos and the header logo.</p>
<p>The category logo size issue is <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/after-2-2-0-beta-5-update-category-logos-are-now-big/103385/3" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> as an upstream regression and so we await a fix to land in the next release.</p>
<p>The header logo issue is another one of those onion-hostility changes that relates to forcing ‘https’ in the protocol, and absolute rather than relative URLs. If I switch on ‘force_https’ mode, I break the onion service entirely I think.</p>
<p>Nonetheless I was able to workaround both with some custom CSS and Nginx tweaks, so you hopefully don’t notice much if anything has changed.</p>
<p>There may be other (minor) impacts related to logo image sizes, other cases of assets being referenced via absolute URLs and its impact on .onion, though probably (hopefully) not. But I thought I’d get on the front foot by saying the usual disclaimer - please avoid making new topics about it or expecting any magic fixes due to Whonix budget constraints, as it’s unlikely we’ll be able to do much.</p>
<p>When Discourse fixes the image issue upstream, I can remove my custom CSS tweaks and then I’ll bin this post.</p>
<p>Obviously if you encounter massive show-stopping problems using the forums, let Patrick know. But the fact that I can add this post indicates things are basically fine.</p>
<p>Happy new year folks…</p>
