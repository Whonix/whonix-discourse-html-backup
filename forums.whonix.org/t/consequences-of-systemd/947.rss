    <title>Consequences of systemd</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/consequences-of-systemd/947</link>
    <description>I&#39;m worried about the sneaky, underhanded way that systemd has been forced upon the community. Is this merely a way to seize control of the Linux kernel, or are they doing this to enable new and more cunning backdoors?

Sure, it&#39;s open source, but are there really enough eyes on the systemd code? There certainly weren&#39;t enough on the issue when they slipped this one thru! Any thought of using Slackware or one of the BSDs instead?</description>
