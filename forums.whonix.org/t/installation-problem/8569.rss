    <title>Installation Problem</title>

    <description>I installed Whonix 17.0.0.7.1 (in accordance with the documentation), but I got an error message in the end. When I tried to start the Gateway VM, the virtualizer informed me, that it could not find the corresponding qcow2 file. I looked into the xml file and saw, that the name of the qcow2 file in the line &quot;source file&quot; doesn&#39;t match the name of the qcow2 file in the libvirt/images/ direction.

Because of this problem I


1) undefined the Gateway and the Workstation VM

2) edited the &quot;source file&quot; line in both xml files (for gateway und workstation) like this:

 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Gateway.qcow2  &gt;&gt;  /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Gateway-XFCE-15.0.0.7.1.qcow2

 /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Workstation.qcow2  &gt;&gt;  /var/lib/libvirt/images/Whonix-Workstation-XFCE-15.0.0.7.1.qcow2

3) redefined the Gateway and the Workstation VM 


It seems to work now, because I can start the Gateway VM, but I&#39;m still not sure, if my solution of the problem was the right one.  

So... what do the experts say?</description>
