    <description>1) When you drag copied text it lags the browser and system and when you let go of the dragged text it slows down even further until it stops. This does not happen with regular TBB builds on other OS. Easily reproducible.

2) Whonix TBB loads default homepage on startup even though a different homepage is set and only when &#39;New identity&#39; is clicked does it load first page with the proper set homepage.

3) Facing same freezing mentioned in the other thread when system is inactive for short period.

4) sdwdate verification taking too long. I think there is another thread on this but this should definitely be faster.

=======================================================
&quot;True, especially for a VM o/s like whonix or qubes. They start unattended VMs that just run the Tor daemon, so no user interaction to add entropy. They traded security of preventing your IP from being exposed for possibly having all your traffic and pgp decrypted. &quot;

            <blockquote>virtualizer = virtualbox 5</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>TBB = latest stable version</blockquote>
Latest stable of TBB. Tor Browser Bundle. Produced by The Tor Project. Downloadable from https://www.torproject.org/.
<blockquote>debian jessie = this happens using latest Whonix version</blockquote>
No. I mean, go to https://www.debian.org/, download Debian jessie operating system from there. [Debian jessie is the operating system, which Whonix is based (derived) from.] Install that inside VirtualBox. Then install TBB from https://www.torproject.org/. See if you can reproduce the error there.

If this was a problem, then this would be a problem non-exclusive to Whonix, but apply to any software running inside VMs.
<p>There is no easy answer. Entropy is a rabbit hole. Apparently very difficult to prove a negative in this world such as “there is no issue”, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot" data-bbcode="true">Russel’s teapot</a> certainly does not exist”. Security research would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Quote <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Entropy:">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Entropy:</a></p>
<blockquote>[html]
The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man4/random.4.html">Linux Kernel man page</a> says: "<i>[...] /dev/random should be suitable for uses that need very high quality randomness</i> [...]".
<p>Quoted from the <a target="_blank" href="https://we.riseup.net/riseup+tech/entropy">riseup.net page about entropy</a>: "<i>[...] entropy-estimation is a black-art and not very well understood [...]</i>".
</p>
<p>While it would be good to be cautions, i.e. learning about the entropy quality in Virtual Machines and if required learning about methods to improve it, it's not a critical problem. Successful entropy estimation attacks have never been reported for any software.
