    <title>Is there any ways to check which IP is connecting to whonix gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/is-there-any-ways-to-check-which-ip-is-connecting-to-whonix-gateway/16026</link>
    <description>Im currently using Qubes OS, im trying to make my traffic through VPN, for that i&#39;ve created everything to make the VPN work. And its working fine luckily. I&#39;ve created sys-vpn and put it between sys-firewall and other-vm/sys-whonix. I&#39;ve followed micah&#39;s mullvad vpn guides and many more threats from qubes os forum to make it work. The VPN is perfectly working whenever im checking the ip and stuff. And when i disconnect it, the connection is literally cutting off as expected, same goes with normal browser as well as whonix/tor,, connection is cutting off means VPN or the tunnel is working. 

But im not 100% sure that the whonix traffic is coming through my VPN server instead of real IP, so the thing i just wanna check or know **IS THERE ANY WAY TO CHECK WHAT&#39;S THE IP ADDRESS WHONIX IS BEING CONNECTED TO AT FIRST?** connecting to my real ip or vpn server ip.

TIA</description>
