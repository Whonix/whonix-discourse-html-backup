    <title>Is there any ways to check which IP is connecting to whonix gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/is-there-any-ways-to-check-which-ip-is-connecting-to-whonix-gateway/16026</link>
    <description>Im currently using Qubes OS, im trying to make my traffic through VPN, for that i&#39;ve created everything to make the VPN work. And its working fine luckily. I&#39;ve created sys-vpn and put it between sys-firewall and other-vm/sys-whonix. I&#39;ve followed micah&#39;s mullvad vpn guides and many more threats from qubes os forum to make it work. The VPN is perfectly working whenever im checking the ip and stuff. And when i disconnect it, the connection is literally cutting off as expected, same goes with normal browser as well as whonix/tor,, connection is cutting off means VPN or the tunnel is working. 

But im not 100% sure that the whonix traffic is coming through my VPN server instead of real IP, so the thing i just wanna check or know **IS THERE ANY WAY TO CHECK WHAT&#39;S THE IP ADDRESS WHONIX IS BEING CONNECTED TO AT FIRST?** connecting to my real ip or vpn server ip.

TIA</description>

            <p>Clearnet might mean different things in different contexts but in this context it means browsing the normal internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Logging into Captive Portals‎ chapter Unsafe Browser in Whonix wiki</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Following these instructions you can access the normal internet from inside Whonix-Gateway.</p>
<p>With this complexity even the term “normal internet” might be confusing. If using Qubes, Whonix-Gateway would use whatever Whonix-Gateway’s (sys-whonix) dom0 Net Qube setting is. If it’s sys-vpn and functional (not leaking) then it’s the VPN’d internet connection.</p>
<p>While these instructions are probably fine, just come to mind that these alternative instructions might be simpler:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#Clearnet_Connectivity_Test">Troubleshooting - Whonix chapter Clearnet Connectivity Test in Whonix wiki</a></p>
<p>You can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>some-VM → sys-vpn → sys-firewall → sys-net</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>sys-whonix → sys-vpn → sys-firewall → sys-net</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both based the VM be it some-VM or sys-whonix must use the sys-vpn. With some-VM it’s trivial to start a web browser such as Firefox and visit some IP check website. With Whonix-Gateway that’s a bit harder - you need to follow above instructions but once you do it’s really the same.</p>
<p>There is much less “magic” than often assumed.</p>

<p>So in this case to download Firefox to browse surface web and put my all traffic through my Real/VPN ip instead of tor (in this firefox obviously)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Firefox alone doesn’t equal surface net. It depends in which VM and how that VM is configured.<br>
For example, running Firefox inside Whonix-Workstation is still over Tor even though not recommended for unrelated reasons (see <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser" class="inline-onebox">Tor Browser Essentials</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s no connection because its coming through Real IP or something?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Making any external connections run from inside for example let’s say Whonix-Gateway terminal is always “difficult”. That’s because Whonix-Gateway “usually” isn’t used to make any connections without Tor. To do connection tests, you need to look up documentation (or re-invent or something, have deep knowledge of Linux networking). Since it’s documented that’s doable.</p>

            <p>What does the <strong>clearnet</strong> meant there? the surface web? to check my actual ip or the ip is connecting before Tor (VPN server ip)?</p>
<p>So in this case to download Firefox to browse surface web and put my all traffic through my Real/VPN ip instead of tor (in this firefox obviously)?
