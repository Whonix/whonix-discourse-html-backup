    <description>I have a running IRC .onion server running ngircd.

I&#39;m planning to add the guide I&#39;m working on([on a secluded subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libregamingdotonion/wiki/ngircd_w14bb)) to the [Onion Services Guides](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Onion_Services_Guides) eventually. Though before that I&#39;d like to add at least 1 bot(that is some form of a gaming bot) to my own server. I&#39;ve considered IdleRPG but they don&#39;t have a libre license so I&#39;ll wait with that one until I run out of options(I hope I don&#39;t).

After doing some research I found a topic on github called [ircbot](https://github.com/topics/ircbot). I&#39;m currently looking into onebot and trying to figure out how to work this thing. As part of the instructions on how to get onebot up and running I might have to get python-pip up and running too and deal with something called &quot; virtualenvwrapper&quot;. This is probably gonna take a lot of my time.

**Update**:

Gathering from this https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/etc/whonix.d/30_whonixcheck_default.conf#L70
I realize python-pip is an unwanted package from a privacy perspective. I&#39;ll try to work without that package. Anyway there&#39;s a whole list of irc bots. I will find something somewhere, I&#39;m pretty sure of that...sooner or later.

IRC bots that worked to some extent:

* https://github.com/ldilley/rubot (it managed to connect to the server but failed entering a channel)

----

* IRC bot &quot;monop&quot; that hosts monopoly on IRC: https://github.com/thlc/monop-irc
