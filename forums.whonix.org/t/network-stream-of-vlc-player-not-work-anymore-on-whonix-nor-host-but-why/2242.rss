    <description>**I have not money for donate whonix i am sorry, so my thanks again to whonix forums.**
_-That is writed for anonymous flash videos online with Whonix-_
I remember i was use network stream on  vlc player inside whonix workstation for watching flash videos online , because adobe flash plugin consider pseudonymous rather anonymous on tbb inside whonix, 
i remember that works on whonix workstation and on host to, but last days i try to use it and not work , nor on host ! i try several workaround for days : reinstall vlc , reset to defaults vlc, the last day i download the latest whonix kvm images (clean) * aplyed to the workaround for vlc crash on kvm and nor that works!  JDownloader works on whonix workstation for watching flash videos online anonymously but if want to watch a video from the midle to the end for example must wait for downloading , with network stream of vlc player not need to wait for that so its better , but why not work? help please , as that is very important for whonix project, (that need for sites like vimeo, because youtube for example not need adobe flash plugin).</description>

            <p>Solution find at last :</p>
<ul>
<li>For first note that is a clean private way and not pseudoprivate , as the vlc streaming inside whonix have not fingerprint protection like TBB , plus must not install flash plugin on TBB , so the solution is : right click on video area , then view page source , inside that file can found the source of video file (other site) then copy and paste to site like <a href="http://catchvideo.net" rel="nofollow noopener">http://catchvideo.net</a> and download it from there , as if try to just copy and paste the ususual url video will not work because must is installed adobe flash plugin on TBB to show the source url.<br>
that’s it .<br>

            <p>Tested… Working (sometimes)</p>
<p><strong>Specific to Vimeo</strong> (maybe change title of thread).</p>

<li>To get URL, use method: <a href="http://superuser.com/a/782685">http://superuser.com/a/782685</a>

<li>Video URL is not visible in ‘Page Info’ unless it is playable (?) by the browser. (Don’t know why that is.)</li>
<li>To make video playable in <strong>Iceweasel</strong> use this method:<br>

</li>
<li>Input URL into VLC: Open Network Stream; Play</li>
</ul>
<p>Played video successfully 2/3 times. Could not open link on initial attempt. Was the circuit too slow? Timeout? Or maybe <a href="http://vimeocdn.com">vimeocdn.com</a> is blocking Tor exit nodes? Need more tries, different circuits…</p>

Might not be Whonix or VLC issue, just wrong URL.<p></p>
<p>If that doesn’t work:<br>
search “vlc network stream vimeo”</p>
<p>Or it might be protocol related. http is no problem obviously but rtp doesn’t always play well with Tor (my experience with voip).</p>

            <p>I speculate, it’s an open research question if streaming (using VLC) may be pseudonymous rather than anonymous also. Haven’t really heard of this and I don’t know any protocol analysis or cleanup tool. I guess downloading the video would leak less data. On the first thought, I would not leak when you pause / resume a video or to which marks you jump.</p>
