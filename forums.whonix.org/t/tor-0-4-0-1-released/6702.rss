    <description>Tor 0.4.0.1 is released. A couple of interesting things are an experimental new padding scheme and a power saving dormant mode. A lot of memory and startup speed optimizations done.

https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2019-January/044826.html

One change that I noticed was for DNS handling. I want to make sure this change does not cause any accidental leaks on the GW: 

&gt;   o Minor bugfixes (DNS):
&gt;     - Gracefully handle an empty or absent resolve.conf file by falling
&gt;       back to using &quot;localhost&quot; as a DNS server (and hoping it works).
&gt;       Previously, we would just stop running as an exit. Fixes bug
&gt;       21900; bugfix on 0.2.1.10-alpha.</description>
