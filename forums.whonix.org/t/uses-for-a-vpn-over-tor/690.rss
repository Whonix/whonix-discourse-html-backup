    <title>Uses for a VPN over Tor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/uses-for-a-vpn-over-tor/690</link>
    <description>Elsewhere (https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,742.msg5567.html#msg5567) Patrick asked why might someone use a VPN over Tor.

There&#39;s a note on the mail server, mail2tor (http://mail2tor2zyjdctd.onion) saying &quot;Our front end got killed.&quot; Presumably, if they had a front end then they also have a back end. The front end might be for the actual receipt and sending of e-mail, and the back end for everything else such as mailboxes. The front end therefore would attract complaints but would be easily replaced. The easiest way to connect them could be by VPN.</description>
