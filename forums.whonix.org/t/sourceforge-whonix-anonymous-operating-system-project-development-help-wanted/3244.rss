    <description>Just now submitted a Project Development Help Wanted post in sourceforge forum.
 https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/helpwanted/programmers/thread/78b0971d/

Haven&#39;t done that in a while. Was time to renew that. Current post below. sourceforge relaxed with edits, post bumps or new posts after a few days. Posting there can be useful. Some contributors found there way to Whonix through that. Suggestions for modifications to the Project Development Help Wanted post or for future posts are welcome.
