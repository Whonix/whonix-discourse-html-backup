    <description>Will be starting to create new tunnel pages as per:

[quote=&quot;0brand, post:1224, topic:3477&quot;]
&gt; Patrick
&gt;
&gt;I think users don’t like documentation for the thing they want to work on split among multiple pages. They want the exact thing they want to do all on one coherent page. This however would require a ton of new wiki templates which then get reused for the many combinations before/after Tor vs VPN vs proxy vs ssh. Perhaps not realistic? Too much work? That’s why above’s quote is stressed.

If you would like me to spend the time on this, i can do that. Might be worth it.

* Easier to follow instruction = Less support requests.
* Pages would be shorter. Maybe users would *actually* read the documentation?
  * Users might not even use a VPN? But not likely, it took me a while before I realized they were not required / not always necessary.

Needs to be done eventually why not start now?

Looks like this will be quite a bit of work so this thread will be used for keeping track of tunnel page/chapter/template creation. Otherwise this could get a little confusing. 

Feel free to edit this post if anything needs to be added.


-----
**New wiki**


When templates are created they will be added under the corresponding pages. There may end up being more pages than what is listed. Once everything is in place the pages will be created. Will also have to fix any broken wiki links and maybe some of the high traffic forum links if needed. It might be worth it to fix as many forum links a possible so there are not more deprecated pages in the wiki 

**Tunnel-link before Tor.**

     * Add content to page as per Patrick.
       &gt; Connections to proxies are unencrypted and therefore should not be used to hide Tor use. Proxies are a type of tunnel-links which are not VPNs or SSH. Proxies are ok for circumvention of censorship if that works for the user but are unsuitable for hiding Tor due to lack of encryption.

            <p>After looking at the tunnels docs I can see why the tutorials might be a little confusing. In certain areas its difficult to tell the actual tutorial steps apart from the required knowledge and examples. Its all mixed together. In my opinion, (<a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN</a>) is the most confusing.</p>
<p>While I’m not fond of the Warning boxes, the information found there is vital since most users would never even think of that stuff.</p>

            <p>Downloading files from the VPN provider and installing resolvconf before breaking the connection solves the difficulties and will be simpler in my opinion than moving things between VMs after it’s broken.</p>
<p>How will you install resolvconf without a connection? I guess there is a way to download it on one machine then install on another but I don’t see how it’s simpler.</p>
<p>Using two VMs in parallel can be very helpful at times but if that’s a mandatory part of the setup here it adds more steps (for example editing the VM’s IP to make sure it can run in parallel).</p>

            <p>Hi <code>sheep</code></p>
<p>Lets recommend users clone the Whonix-Workstation and use the clone for VPN configuration. Its good practice to always have clean Whonix VM available for cases like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to download a new image every time a clean VM is needed. Convenience for the user. (saves a lot of time)</li>
<li>Avoid inexperienced users reverting edits without understanding what they are doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way the cloned VM does not need to have an internet connection during configuration. And there will be a functional workstation for troubleshooting if they need it.  If moving content around would simplify the instructions we could do that.</p>
<p>I was told recently “Don’t let perfect be the enemy of progress”. Or something similar to that. I think that applies here.</p>

<p>Who`s your number one pic for the examples?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think Mullvad will be good for the examples.</p>
<p>Another point re the VPN pages - if I recall correctly the instructions to install resolvconf are at a point the user lost internet connection due to reload of Whonix firewall, and before the new connection (with openvpn) is established. Should we move the following to the top?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo apt-get update<br>
sudo apt-get install resolvconf</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If users follow the instructions from top to bottom, there will be similar difficulties with downloading files from the VPN provider.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps move the Fail Safe Mechanism to the bottom? anyway it’s clear users should use some kind of connection to download stuff required to configure the connection…</p>
<p>Last point: I recall previous versions of the VPN pages included the “aptitude keep-all” command. I see now that it was removed on Feb 3. Is it not required?</p>

<li>Even after the first time this person was in trouble why was he allowed back? It would be obvious this bringing back person would have affected revenue? Why?
<ul>
<li>Personal relationship?</li>
<li>Business relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stated as a Decentralized service - who really  owns crytpostorm. Could this person still have partial ownership but does not have access to severs? (silent partner)They never mentioned that and refuse to state who really owns cryptstorm. (my mistake. I thought decentralized might be a good thing. No, not with service providers)</li>
<li>I have not attachment to this provider.</li>
<li>Whonix can not use this provider for examples. Other users will bring this up? I have no interest defending this decision when there are other providers that meet requirements. This could end up blowing up in out face.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>sheep</code> seems to have good ideas and judgement. Thanks for bringing this up. Who`s your number one pic for the examples?</p>

<p>Don’t know. I see that Nord’s 7-days free trial requires a CC so not relevant here. There’s also a 30-day money back guarantee with crypto payment accepted but it still requires an advance payment for that month.</p>

<p>One point I like about NordVPN (Mullvad doesn’t have this advantage) is that don’t expose all of their servers as a public list. It’s less trivial for a site to blacklist or discriminate against their IPs. I guess still possible though. Searching in Shodan, I could easily identify that it is a Nord server.</p>

<p>Im not concerned about that idoit. For the short time he came back it was mostly helping out with forum support. He is long gone now so that review has quite a bit of outdated info. Not that there aren’t any good points though. Would like to have configs from several providers if possible. Its tough to find decent ones that have a free service with no email registration. There are some that provide free service but with required email reg.  Appreciate that you’ve been helping out!</p>

            <p>Didn’t dig into it beyond reading those two sources, but as far as I gathered the reason he got uninvolved with the project at some point was his drug dealing, smuggling and bestiality conviction and incarceration. After his release they took him back (!), then he had further legal issues so his involvement stopped. There are other question. This provider does not even clearly state in which jurisdiction they reside. “Contact us” page only gives emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This review (which also talks to a CryptoStorm spokesperson) states that CryptoStorm is based in Iceland. I can, however, find no other confirmation of this. Iceland is good for privacy, but if CryptoStorm is indeed based in there, then it is interesting to note that it runs no servers from that location. Update: CryptoStorm has told me that: " <em>Which country are you based in from a legal perspective? Iceland, actually we don’t care.</em> "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At any case - I am happy to assist on the technical sides of assessing providers, but it will take me some time. I really think we can do better then to give this provider as an example but as Patrick said, you’re doing it so it makes sense it will be your call.</p>

            <p>I would also like to clarify my last posts.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend any of the providers above for <strong>usage</strong>. Not NordVPN or any of them. Users, please do your own due diligence.</p>
<p>I did recommended NordVPN to be used as an example for this guide. This is not intended to be any kind of review as to the quality of Nord or any of the others. <strong>It is simply an attempt to hypothesize what will be useful for Whonix users when they come to follow the VPN page instructions</strong>, many of them already come with a clear idea of which provider to use, as can be seen in the search results I presented. I just know that many Tor users who value their anonymity and also require VPN (with or without Tor) mostly go for those. Maybe they’re making a horrible mistake with their choice - I’m no authority on that matter.</p>
<p>If the choice was mine I’d take the 3 top providers who appeared in search results, and evaluate them only according to the technical aspects (have free service / tcp / ease of setup etc). Any attempt to make an opinion on the less then visible aspects (try to guess… do they really store logs or not? what is the chance they are compromised? etc) is meaningless, although it is very common to see those kind of reviews</p>
<p>By the way I’ve seen less than favorable reviews on the person behind CryptoStorm and about other points with them.</p>

<p>Now perhaps the author is just a hater of CryptoStorm for some reason. I can’t be the judge of that. Maybe the other providers give him better affiliate fees or something. Can’t tell. But when I see zero interest in this provider from users on this forum I will gladly move on.</p>

<p>I should have been more specific about recommendations. For any recommendation</p>
<ul>
<li>the provider was thoroughly screened to the best your abilities. security very important.</li>
<li>has a free service or limited use free service.</li>
<li>has free service that supports both <code>tcp</code> and <code>udp</code> (possible exception could be made for a proto <code>udp</code> only provider)</li>
<li>no email registration if preferred (but not necessary)</li>
<li>(nice to have) provider that can be used for light browsing. This could be useful for maintainer/user: bypass Tor censorship testing?  Tunnel over UDP testing? Tunnel testing in general?</li>
<li>took a look at some reviews of provider. has a good reputation</li>
<li>simplified setup</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible/likely some the your recommendations meet requirements. cryptostorm meets those requirements. i.e. I thoroughly screened to the best of my abilities.</p>

            <p>I agree some provider is better than no provider.</p>
<p>If we must choose one, I would go for NordVPN for this guide.</p>
<p>They’re not necessarily my personal choice, but consistently appears on any list I’ve seen that discusses anonymous / crypto accepting VPN providers. Others that are frequently mentioned are ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access (PIA), TorGuard, Mullvad, AirVPN, ProtonVPN. There are more.</p>
<p>Running a search on this forum, NordVPN were mentioned 7 times on support tickets. Mullvad appear 15 times. Five results for TorGuard. One for ExpressVPN, 11 results for PIA, 10 for AirVPN, none for Proton VPN.</p>
<p>Four results for Cryptostorm. Two of them initiated by a company representative and one of the results is this thread.</p>
<p>I would argue that unless they have very noticeable advantages, CryptoStorm are an obscure choice.</p>

<p>That would be cool. The only other issue I could think of would be wading through all the proposed edits from VPN adversisters. Also posts from users asking for <code>sheep</code>/other wiki maintainers to review a specific service provider. This could turn into a real mess.</p>
<p>This gave me an idea though. I could use some specific provider suggestions to use in <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Examples" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Examples</a>. Then i can go through and set them up in a Debian VM (when I have time) and add the steps needed on that page.</p>
<p><em>If</em> possible that page should use providers that don’t require any type of  email registration</p>

            <p>Armed with knowledge and no specific example being done mostly isn’t how users operate.</p>
<p>The people who do most work just be the ones also to make most decisions.</p>
<p>Since in this case 0brand is working on research, testing and documentation of VPN documentation, I’ll leave the ultimate decision about choosing which provider to 0brand. This has also pragmatic reasons. By spoiling the fun for contributors, one’s likely to loose the contributor. So unless it’s something that justifies a <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/issues-with-and-alternatives-to-democracy-and-majority-votes/638/5">objection or veto</a> (which is unlikely in this specific case), I’d let 0brand decide.</p>

</aside>
<p>We gain no doubts about affiliation of Whonix with any VPN provider. Disclaimers are better than no disclaimers but it’s best if we don’t need them in the first place. At any case people are going to wonder, why provider X and not Y? riseup’s choice could be justified, or implicitly understood, without lengthy explanations, more easily than other choices (at least before their canary drama).</p>
<p>Look, my ideal solution isn’t going to happen. Say, if there was an openvpn server on <a href="http://whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix.org</a> that only allows connections to <a href="http://whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whonix.org</a> or maybe also to <a href="http://torproject.org" rel="nofollow noopener">torproject.org</a>. Users could then test the VPN setup with a real connection and then revise settings to match their own provider. If something doesn’t work at that point, they know they should look at the provider’s settings for answers. But that kind of infrastructure not only increases Whonix’s involvement with users connections, it might imply Whonix endorses VPN in general. Plus there will be added maintenance involved. Second best is using a real provider.</p>

<p>I think it’s a good criteria, but without the payment option.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can think of many reasons to <strong>not</strong> limit usage. What would be gained by doing this? I doubt users would even try the test setup if they new it was only to see a Connection Successful message. Just because there might be users that could use the VPN for general use doesn’t mean that option should be taken away. If they don’t head the warning and recommendations its on them. This should be their choice to make.</p>
