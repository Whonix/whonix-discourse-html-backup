    <description>I have downloaded whonix gateway xfce and whonix workstation xfce, but i found two issues so far with whonix workstation:
1. Tor browser won&#39;t start. I tried to launch it from the start menu and by clicking on tor launcher file, but it won&#39;t start.
2. Ricochet won&#39;t connect to tor. It only shows &#39;connecting&#39;, but it won&#39;t connect.</description>

            <p>The Tor browser started working. I didn’t do anything, just restarted the workstation.<br>
I followed the instructions and Ricochet is connection to tor. Actually, i got this issue before, but forget i need to do additional setup.<br>
But i have problem installing Electrum. I am following the instruction from the official site and i am getting error that it needs newer python version - 3.6. How to install it?</p>
