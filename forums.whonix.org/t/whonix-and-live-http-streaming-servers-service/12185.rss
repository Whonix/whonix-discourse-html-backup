    <description>Does anyone know if it is possible to decentralise a live streaming service , so it can only be accessed through whonix or tor etc

i have 10 servers I would say I&#39;m nearly at an advanced beginner level with Linux I&#39;m constantly doing different random projects just learning and playing about with things, I cant find any resource or threads any where regards my question the current setup is..

client connects to nginx reverse proxy through and an android media player app then the clients connection is forwarded and then passed onto what ever lb is streaming what they have selected, not a lot to it, but I would like to decentralise it if possible, thanks</description>
