    <description>Hi, 

Attempting sudo release-upgrade on whonix-gw (Non Qubes), and it is failing on sdwdate:

Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.5-2) ...
Processing triggers for desktop-file-utils (0.23-4) ...
+ true &#39;INFO: Install pre release upgrade of dependency packages (2/2)...&#39;
+ apt-get-noninteractive --yes --no-install-recommends install sdwdate
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 sdwdate : Depends: helper-scripts but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
+ true &#39;ERROR: An error was encountered during download of dependency packages. Recommendation:
Fix network connection and retry.&#39;
+ exit 1

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks</description>

            <p>Hi Patrick - Just an FYI - the updated release-upgrade script also worked without issue on Whonix WS (I also have full log output of this upgrade if your interested)</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much Patrick - The updated release-upgrade script worked without issue on GW.</p>

0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>I have a “lot” of user data that needs to be maintained, hence why I’m attempting the release-upgrade method (On both GW and WS).</p>
