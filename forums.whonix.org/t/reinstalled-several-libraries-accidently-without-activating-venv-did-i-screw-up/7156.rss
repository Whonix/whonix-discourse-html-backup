    <title>Reinstalled several libraries accidently without activating venv - did I screw up?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/reinstalled-several-libraries-accidently-without-activating-venv-did-i-screw-up/7156</link>
    <description>So I am trying to install a distributed email (Mailpile), and I accidentally installed a bunch of libraries in the global Whonix install rather than doing it in a virtual environment (forgot to activate venv)...am I screwed? I am assuming these packages came pre-configured with Whonix? But I could be wrong. Here are the libraries I reinstalled: 

&gt; 
&gt; Successfully installed Jinja2-2.10.1 PySocks-1.6.8 appdirs-1.4.3 asn1crypto-0.24.0 cffi-1.12.2 cryptography-2.6.1 enum34-1.1.6 fasteners-0.14.1 imgsize-2.1 ipaddress-1.0.22 lockfile-0.12.2 lxml-4.3.3 markupsafe-1.1.1 monotonic-1.5 pbr-5.1.3 pgpdump-1.5 pillow-6.0.0 pyDNS-2.3.6 pycparser-2.19 setuptools-41.0.0 six-1.12.0 spambayes-1.1b3 stem-1.7.1

I am new to server management in general and also Whonix.</description>
