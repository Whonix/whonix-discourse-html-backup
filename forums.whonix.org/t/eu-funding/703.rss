    <description>There are instances of EU funding open computing initiatives, for example KDE&#39;s desktop semantic search. Patrick have you considered applying for grant programs?

Provided that the money is neutral and has no strings attached, it would be great for you.

            <p>There are ~30 or so or more potential sponsors that one could ask.</p>
<p>Going through their hoops (reading up all their stuff, writing proposals, communication) apparently is a huge task. Copy and paste won’t work. If I was to go through all of them, I couldn’t to much development for a half year or so.</p>
<p>One could make oneself a full time paid position for working on that stuff:<br>

<p>There are 3 active discussions with sponsors at the moment. Nothing definitive yet. May or may very well not succeed. Mostly they find Whonix too unusable due to its two VM design.</p>
<p>Without funding it’s hard to find high skilled developers who could do the difficult stuff such as VirtualBox GUI replacements [or whatever a great dev could do to improve usability] and such. Very few applied:<br>

<p>And without the potential manpower it’s difficult to find a sponsor. A bootstrap issue.</p>

<p>Most EU funding finances programmes that further EU policies. A small amount is spent on contracts to buy in services and goods for EU institutions.</p>
