    <title>Qubes-Whonix + Wireless (bluetooth or wifi) monitor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-whonix-wireless-bluetooth-or-wifi-monitor/14527</link>
    <description>Hello to all.

I would like to use a **wireless 13-15 inch touchscreen monitor** connected either through bluetooth, wifi (or any other way I do not care as long as it works) to a Qubes-Whonix PC (mini-PC). 

**Requirements**:
==&gt; 90% of the time this monitor is for having in bed, on couch and travel (train/car) therefore wireless would be ideal but I could consider having to use a very flexible cable if necessary... 
==&gt; Security-wise: I am no hacker, no dark net, no journalist/whistleblower so no need to have the strongest level of security. I however discovered I had a sick eavesdropper on my computer for god knows how many months/years and also would like to be sure my &quot;anonimity&quot; remains strong on streaming websites for example !

**Questions**:
- is it possible with Qubes-Whonix ?
- if yes is there any (complex) configuration needed ?
- what should I look for when looking at wireless touchscreens specifications in order to make sure the monitor will work with Qubes-Whonix ?</description>

            <p>This depends on Qubes only. If Qubes is functional, then there should be nothing specific to Qubes-Whonix. Therefore this belongs to Qubes support.</p>

    As a rule of thumb: 

Everything that happens “inside” the virtual machines is Qubes-Whonix and belongs into this sub forum.
Everything that happens “outside” the virtual machine is Qubes and the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/help/">Qubes help</a> should be consulted.


Some examples: 

EFI → <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/">Qubes support</a>

libvirtError → <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/support/">Qubes support</a>
