Lets say I want to enable shared folders on the host by default and I select a pre-existing folder. What is an appropriate folder path to include in the XML that will not violate user expectation or expose their private data to untrusted VMs?

<p>Unfortunately so. I guess it was worth a try.</p>

            <p>My first thought is: none of the already existing folders such as <code>~/Download</code>. That would surprise the user.</p>
<p>Also does the virtualizer refuse to start if the folder is non-existing?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a blocker.</li>
<li>But if so, bad for usability.</li>
<li>Could still be covered by telling the user to create that folder in instructions. I guess for KVM one more step doesn’t matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shared folder for which VM? I mean, ~/shared-whonix-gateway ~/shared-whonix-workstation but what when using multiple workstation’s?</p>
<p>Doesn’t sound easy, but cool to have.</p>
