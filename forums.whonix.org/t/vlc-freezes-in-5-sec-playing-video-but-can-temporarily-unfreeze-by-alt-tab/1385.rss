    <title>VLC freezes in &lt; 5 sec playing video but can temporarily unfreeze by ALT-TAB</title>

    <description>[s]Symptom: VLC freezes (stops responding) in about 1-2 sec, and I have to killall -9. I can get it to where it takes longer to freeze and is possible to prod into unfreezing, but that&#39;s the best I can do. It doesn&#39;t matter what video I play, or even the format. It happens on everything. I had a similar issue with previous versions of Whonix but for the life of me can&#39;t remember what I did to solve them other than it involved building my own VLC.

[i][b]Edit: Updating Virtualbox to 5.0.3 test (r102467) seemed to solved issue. I&#39;ll update if anything changes. I was using 4.3.30 before[/b][/i]

It may be a good idea to add release notes that Virtualbox / Windows 10 use Virtualbox 5.0.3 and up. According to Virtualbox devs, there were some Windows 10 fixes in Virtualbox 5.0.3 test.

[s]
I have Whonix 11.0.0.3.0, having let auto updates run
Host: Windows 10 running Virtualbox 4.3.30 r101610, Intel core i7 4-way with 16GB of ram, x86-64

Per FAQ, change following setting:
VLC -&gt; Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Video -&gt; Output -&gt; X11 -&gt; Save

No change, VLC still freezes on every video play after 1-2 sec

kill vlc in terminal just to be safe killall -9 vlc
Then, change the following setting: Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Input/Codecs -&gt; Hardware Accelerated Decoding -&gt; Disable -&gt; Save

Now it doesn&#39;t freeze every single time (just most times) and often lasts 3-5 seconds before freezing. I can now unfreeze it by ALT+TAB between Linux apps or by clicking &quot;close&quot; on virtualbox and then hitting cancel. 

However, it still freezes every 3-5 seconds (with an occasional longer &quot;lucky&quot; period) and I have to keep ALT+TABing to watch a full video. Eventually, entire video plays through this way, and vlc can play another video. On rare occasions, vlc still freezes and I have to hit close on virtualbox window and run killall. But it&#39;s less often now.

Host is working fine, and no other apps are freezing

Any ideas? Any dmesg or other output I should look for, etc?

I would ask vlc people, but this has happened every release of Whonix, so I think it&#39;s something peculiar to whonix. I don&#39;t have the issue with Tails in Virtualbox but I don&#39;t like Tails for many reasons and prefer Whonix.

Issue described here, but already suggested same thing as in Whonix FAQ: http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=116074&amp;p=591948#p591948
