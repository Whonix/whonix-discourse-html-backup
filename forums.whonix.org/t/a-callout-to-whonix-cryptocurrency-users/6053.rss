    <title>A Callout to Whonix Cryptocurrency Users</title>

    <description>Dear Whonix users,

Members of the Monero community recently approached us in the Organization forum about ways in which we could collaborate together. [1]

The Monero community has a reputation for being passionate about privacy and there are a significant number of users who also rely on Whonix for their activities. With obvious shared goals and interests, a number of Monero community members quickly came forward and provided detailed, fully-functional instructions for Monero on the Whonix platform. [2]

The Whonix team would like to thank OSNF2P, thotbot, rehrar and others for their efforts and ongoing maintainer status of the Monero wiki page.

Based on this success, we would like to welcome members from other popular cryptocurrency communities such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and so on to step forward and improve the existing Whonix wiki sections that already exist, but which are either out-of-date or unfinished. [3]

The wiki badly needs the love of aficionados who want a win-win for both communities: working crypto instructions combined with a higher-security, virtualized platform.

Anybody who is willing to contribute can freely edit the relevant wiki pages and/or nominate themselves for maintainer status.
