    <description>Recently whonix is no longer able to sync its time and thus unable to connect to the tor network. When running:

&gt; $ whonixcheck --verbose

on the gateway I get the following:

I am unable to link to the screenshots (I have also posted this question on the tor stackexchange):

[same question](http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/10366/whonix-cannot-sync-time)

Rrunning **arm** on the gateway shows that it is not connected to the tor network:



Looking at the logs suggested by **whonixcheck**:

&gt; tail -f /var/log/sdwdate.log

it can be seen that there is no connection to the network:


The output of **timesync** on the gateway is:


Checking the logs of **timesync** 

&gt; tail -f -n 20 /var/log/sdwdate.log

gives:

[timesync 6](http://i.stack.imgur.com/m9Kvy.png)

I&#39;m also unable to set the **hwclock**. Running:

&gt; # date +%T -s &quot;01:01:30&quot;

changes the time locally, but **hwclock** returns the same time entry as before setting it with **date**. Also, the time I set is reset on each reboot (both on the gateway and workstation)(I&#39;m running whonix in VirtualBox on a Win7 host machine).

Another thing worth mentioning is that a few days ago I made a dual 
boot setup (debian/win7) and booted in debian. I also disabled the UEFI 
boot option in BIOS in order to be able to boot from a USB stick and 
install debian. 

Why isn&#39;t whonix able to sync its time?</description>

            <p>Thanks, the date was offset behind by one day. Now tor can connect both in the host and guest machines.</p>

            <p>I’ve run into a very weird issue. I have a dual boot setup debian/win7. On the host machines the latest tor browser bundle (I am using the latest stable version (I’ve downloaded it Today)) is unable to connect. It displays a message Loading network status and hangs there. Bellow is the complete output:</p>
<p><a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/16290983/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://paste.ubuntu.com/16290983/</a></p>
<p>Strangely, in one of my virtual machines I’m running an older version of tor that is able to connect. I am behind a NAT on a wireless device. I am also running the browser on a wired machine which is also able to connect. Does tor look at the network interface type? This happens with recent versions of tor.</p>
<p>The logs of type “notice” shown in the GUI are:</p>
