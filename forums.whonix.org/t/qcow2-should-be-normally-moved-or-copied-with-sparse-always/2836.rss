    <title>qcow2 should be normally moved or copied with --sparse=always ?</title>

    <description>ok noob problem and most of people must have already noticed it. 
I am installing whonix 13. on debian jessie as recommended by wiki.

I do not understand, I should only move the qcow2 templates to libvirt images folder or copy command is also necessary? I tried doing both first moved then copy just as explained on wiki. While copying it gives me error &quot;cannot stat ‘Whonix-Gateway*.qcow2’: No such file or directory&quot; because file does not exist in home folder anymore. What should I do next again extract the &#39;.xz&#39; and then execute the copy command? or leave it as it is?

&quot;Moving Whonix Image Files&quot; this section is really confusing, at first it recommends not to copy but only move then it explains how --sparse=always is important and that is executed with copy command? what is going on?</description>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The choice to copy vs move something is up to you. It comes down to whether you want to make back-ups or not.</p>

<p>sparse parameter makes sure that when its copied it doesn’t take up 100GB only its original size ~1GB</p>
