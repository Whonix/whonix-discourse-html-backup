    <title>Tor browser</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tor-browser/709</link>
    <description>Hello,

I Tried to open tor browser earlier and had a few issues, when I eventually got it to open it was the new firefox browser which I can remember installing but wasnt an issue. shut down whonix and opened up a few hours later and now when I try to run Tor it keeps saying &#39;tor browser exited abnormally&#39; 

Thanks for the help.</description>

            <p>Got latest Whonix version or got latest updates?</p>
<p>Otherwise… Dunno. Damaged profile perhaps?</p>
<p>Firefox crashed and still running? Try this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>(Reboot also makes sure none is running anymore.)</p>
<p>Downloading a new one using torbrowser-updater should also solve it?</p>
