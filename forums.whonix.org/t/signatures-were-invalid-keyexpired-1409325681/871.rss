    <description>Hi.

I have similar problem as in https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,892.0.html thread but a bit different.

1. This fix doesn&#39;t work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;fpr=&quot;916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA&quot;
gpg --recv-keys &quot;$fpr&quot;
gpg --fingerprint &quot;$fpr&quot; 
gpg --export &quot;$fpr&quot; | sudo apt-key add -&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When running it I&#39;m having this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;user@host:~$ gpg --recv-keys &quot;$fpr&quot;
gpg: requesting key 0x8D66066A2EEACCDA from hkp server 2eghzlv2wwcq7u7y.onion
11:40:06 libtorsocks(14925): connect: Connection is to a local address (192.168.0.10), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks.
11:40:10 libtorsocks(14925): SOCKS V4 connect rejected:
11:40:10 libtorsocks(14925): SOCKS server refused connection
gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 52: getpeername() failed with errno 107: Transport endpoint is not connected
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2. KEYEXPIRED error a bit differs. While upgrading I&#39;m having this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;W: A error occurred during the signature verification. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://deb.torproject.org stable Release: The following signatures were invalid: KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681 KEYEXPIRED 1409325681

W: Failed to fetch http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/dists/stable/Release  

W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;ve found &quot;The Tor Project&#39;s apt repository key expired&quot; thread on the forum with the same &quot;KEYEXPIRED 1409325681&quot; but there is no fix at it.

P.S.: Whonix v8.1

Please help.</description>
