    <title>VPN between clearnet and whonix gateway on Qubes</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/vpn-between-clearnet-and-whonix-gateway-on-qubes/1115</link>
    <description>Just want to update this.

Through some testing either sys-net or sys-firewall give the desired results. I prefer sys-net.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am just wondering if my suspicions are correct
for my purposes I require a VPN between my clearnet connection so that all tor traffic passes through the VPN.

The netvm topology on Qubes is as follows
sys-net -&gt; sys-firewall -&gt; whonix-gw -&gt; whonix-ws

I had it running on Sys-Firewall but just realized there&#39;s also clearnet access on Sys-Net.

I&#39;m thinking Sys-Net start with the lowest common denominator.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
