            <p>oh sorry sometimes they are</p>
<p>like do you want phone notifications while logged in.</p>
<p>more often they are:</p>
<p>attempts at canvas fingerprinting  or something,  since I don’t actual log in to much  while  on / in TBB</p>
<p>but, they sure are annoying to have to click “not now”  over and over</p>

</aside>
<p>No, stream isolation is unrealated here. It is a purely connection related thing, whereas this is a security meassure implemented on the browser level.</p>
<p>You could activate it via “about:config”, though that would obviously change your browser fingerprint, making you more trackable. The setting would be “dom.push.enable”.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>so the same website, will need to be cleared of the popup cause of isolation of streams?</p>
<p>any thoughts to disabling it completely, I would do it in the about:config but of course that would dis anon  myself.</p>
<p>hard to believe one now has to live with hitting these popups 500 times</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, that is just a result of keeping every tab as secluded and seperate as possible. So, simply, security.</p>
