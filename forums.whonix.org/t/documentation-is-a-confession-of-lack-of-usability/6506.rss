I guess that would depend on what was found out by polling. In other words *if* a majority of users are using webmail why are they using it instead of an email client. It might not even be due to lack of knowledge of [safe email principles ](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/E-Mail#Safe_Email_Principles).

For example, it could be that the wiki instructions are to complicated for some users.
[/quote]
Probably too complicated for large majorities.

[quote=&quot;0brand, post:6, topic:6505&quot;]
But for the most part it wouldn’t surprise me if users don’t read the wiki because they don’t know about certain documentation
[/quote]
Very much so.

[quote=&quot;0brand, post:6, topic:6505&quot;]
or just don’t care to read it
[/quote]
Also.

[quote=&quot;0brand, post:6, topic:6505&quot;]
If you look at support requests, its mostly questions that are already answered in the wiki. So inexperience and/or laziness likely plays a part?
[/quote]

Sure.

But the reason why I answer this in a separate thread:

----

In some book on programming I was reading recommendations for using code comments, was something like:

* if you fail to express what you want to say in code, add a comment for clarification
* don&#39;t comment things which are obvious from the code, that&#39;s just noise

----

Translated to usability:

I would go as far as saying if writing documentation is required, it is admittance that the usability is lacking.

Documentation is a confession of lack of usability.

This will sound bold to many technical people but if we look at usability research we can see that most users already fail at far lower barriers. Called `Stop-Points`, see this PDF:

[Eliminating Stop-Points in the Installation and Use of Anonymity Systems: a Usability Evaluation of the Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.petsymposium.org/2012/papers/hotpets12-1-usability.pdf)

On usability, I recommend watching the following video. Worth the hour.

<p>Not many studies on usability research like this. I think everyone can relate to this study. Especially when using Linux. I’m mean how often do we have to stop to troubleshoot a problem. Like the paper states, this holds true for more experienced users as well.</p>
<p>This study is interesting because Tor Project has really been pushing forward with UX, UI changes for the last year or so.</p>

<p>So true! Most users don’t care how Whonix works. They <s>just want</s> expect it to work with little to no intervention.   Not everybody finds hacking fun so I can understand that. Well I <em>kinda</em> understand. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
