    <title>Workstation hanging and Bootstrap error over several hours of use</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/workstation-hanging-and-bootstrap-error-over-several-hours-of-use/1415</link>
    <description>Generally I&#39;m finding Whonix easy to use as a new comer to Linix and security, however these two things continue. 

I have noticed that Workstation will hang after several hours of use, particularly if i have more than 6 tabs on Tor open. It becomes unresponsive and restarting the VM is the only way to resolving. I normally have The Key manager open too. 

Similarly Gateway will come up with a Bootstrap error after several hours of use, swapping between Host OSx and VM. I always check Tor Bundle which will connect and the host still has access to the Net. 

Once the bootstrap can&#39;t connect to Tor, the only resolution is restarting the host and then the VMs, restarting the VM&#39;s alone isn&#39;t enough. 

Its not the end of the world, I can still use the system with great success most of the time but it can be a little annoying to close down all my applications and workflow to re-start. 

Cheers,

            <p>Please don’t use Tor as synonym for Tor Browser. That causes confusion.</p>
<p>If the workstation is crashing when using too many Tor Browser tabs, try to increase Whonix-Workstation RAM setting and see if it works better then.</p>

            <p>Its a brand new MacBook, put new VM on to install Whonix.</p>
<p>But no worries if its too difficult to diganose.</p>
<p>Its much better if I don’t put too much tabs open in Tor. It seems to be tor that crashes.</p>

            <p>Probably not an issue caused by Whonix. More likely an issue of the virtualizer and/or host operating system. Difficult to diagnose. You’re probably better off switching to a Libre Software host operating system for security and also stability reasons.</p>
