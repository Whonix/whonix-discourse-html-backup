    <description>Hi

first I want to say thank you for the effort that you are putting into this project.

I wanted to try a VPN service but one of the software requirements was resolvconf. I installed it but especially the following lines make me worried and I&#39;m afraid I &quot;damaged&quot; my whonix iństallation

&gt; Removing non-qubes-whonix-workstation (3:3.4.2-1) ...
&gt; Removing whonix-workstation-shared-packages-shared-meta (3:3.4.2-1) ...
&gt; Removing whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies (3:3.4.2-1) ...
&gt; Removing whonix-workstation-packages-dependencies-pre (3:3.4.2-1) ...
&gt; Removing anon-ws-dns-conf (3:1.1-1) ...
&gt; Removing &#39;diversion of /etc/resolv.conf to /etc/resolv.conf.anondist-orig by anon-ws-dns-conf&#39;

Was it wrong to install it and how can I make it undo? Did it compromise my security/anonymity?

I&#39;m ok to not use the VPN but I just want to get to the state from before the installation. It seems it removed a lot !?

Thank u

<p>If you did this only in the workstation VM you should still be fine. Gateway however you probably messed up some very important things. Never ever change DNS resolution to something other than Tor or install anything on your Gateway anyhow.</p>
