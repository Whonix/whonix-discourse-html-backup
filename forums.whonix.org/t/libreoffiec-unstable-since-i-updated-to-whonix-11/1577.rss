    <title>LibreOffiec unstable since I updated to whonix 11</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/libreoffiec-unstable-since-i-updated-to-whonix-11/1577</link>
    <description>Was with whonix 9 for a while, when finally switched to 11 (clean install) i foudn that libreoffice was very unstable. 
It will crash regularly upon saving, without saving the last stuff. Quite annoying. Already lost some work.

I&#39;m asking here and not in Debian forum, because it was very stable in previous whonix, so thought it might be somehow related to a change in whonix 11? Even if that feels unlikely.

Well, is someone else having that issue?</description>

            <p>Yes this is completely understandable and I think that no one in their right mind will expect you to do so.<br>
We are extremely grateful for what you already do!</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have the time to do all that from above either, I would love to do so, but I really can’t afford it right now.</p>
<p>Just putting this here for anyone else that might have the same issue.</p>
<p>The last update doesn’t fix it but I found that it doesn’t crash with the very same VM image on another PC. Weird yes.</p>

            <p>They very well might.</p>
<p>If the root cause is already happening in Debian, then the same will happen in Whonix. The Whonix distribution / team is much too small to fix every issue that can happen in any package (many thousand) not developed under the Whonix umbrella.</p>
<p>If you care about some types of issues being fixed, the only realistic way is to try to reproduce them on plain Debian. And if applicable, help Debian and/or the original software distributor to fix them. Search for existing bug reports. Create a new one if applicable. Provide requested debug information. Test fixes. Then these fixes will also land in Whonix.</p>
<p>Sorry, yes, this is an awful service from a customer point of view. But we’re nowhere remotely near a of an all inclusive service product. This is Libre Software. Quote, “Users must be treated as co-developers.”</p>

            <p>They just updated it today, so hoping that fixed it.</p>
<p>Since I have almost default setup, I imagined other whonix 11 users will have same issue, but I guess not.</p>

            <p>Probably unrelated to Whonix.</p>
<p>Whonix 10, Debian wheezy based.<br>
Whonix 11, Debian jessie based.</p>
<p>That makes a difference.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to try to reproduce on Debian jessie as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a>.</p>
<p>Only one thing: check free RAM during run of libre office.</p>
