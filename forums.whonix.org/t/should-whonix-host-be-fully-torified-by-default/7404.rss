<p>if a user has Kicksecure on their Whonix Host, it should be able to use the clearnet with our planned changes to iptables rules. The Kicksecure template points to the “default” virtual network.</p>

            <p>I think that there should be an exception, maybe just for using Kicksecure VMs without Tor, there could be some kind of warning with this.</p>
<p>For most people to be able to use this as their daily driver, they need some way to have non-tor vm as not all activites can be done over tor due to restrictions and in some cases tor might not be helpful. Unfortunately the digital infrastructure isn’t here for most people to use only tor all the time.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if Kicksecure VM templates are planned to be included in Whonix host, but it would be at least a good option during installation with a clear warning, or at least something that can be ‘apt-get’ installed from the whonix repo.</p>
<p>A combination of Whonix &amp; Kicksecure VMs is in my opinion something that really makes daily usage (and adoption) a lot more practical.</p>

<p>We already have an idea of how this should be implemented, but need time to do it. The address ranges of Virtual networks would be excluded in host iptables rules from redirection to Tor.</p>

            <p>The workflow is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian based OS (using torghost, so all is torrified and using TCP) -&gt; whonix gateway (connect directly to torghost) -&gt; whonix workstations or other vm connected to the whonix gateway.<br>
I run torghost because at the end is my main host OS, and so I still use mozilla firefox. But the problem is like Patrick says, is to rover tor.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we should be look for another solution in which main host connection is already torrified, and gateway connection is torrfied but in separate mode, not in tor over tor.<br>

            <p>One method you could do it (using whonix inside a debian based OS) is to install torghost hxxps://github .com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost in the whonix-host,and then start whonix gateway, but in my case sometimes I have some problems.</p>
<p>What do you think about this method?</p>

            <p>For initial Whonix-Host release my plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>no clearnet traffic allowed</li>
<li>optional clearnet / captive portal will be sorted out in a later release or user documentation</li>
<li>torified traffic for apt and sdwdate
<ul>
<li>separate host Tor process, <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Anon_Connection_Wizard">anon connection wizard</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because the Whonix brand stands for “the all Tor operating system”. No exceptions. No IFs. That brand must not be damaged / confused / diluted.</p>

<li>Is to become its own separate thing with  clearnet access and selective anonymity profiles (potentially VPN/I2P access thrown into the mix) on baremetal, using lightweight app sandboxing to do its thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Unistation too complex with diminishing returns, go for a hardened vanilla baremetal Kicksecure and forget about the whole anonymity part.</p>

    How easy is it to adapt corridor and allow non torrified VMs like Kicksecure to connect too? Think dealing with captive portals. Per vm network granularity may be bluntly possible  by excluding the kvm user group from networking restrictions o ensure no other non tor traffic form the host may happen. This should allow updates via apt-tor to work too.

<p>Reframing the question:<br>
What purposes are we using Whonix Host for besides hosting Whonix VMs in a secure way?</p>
<p>I would argue for turning the Whonix Host into something resembling Dom0 where no internet access is possible for software running there except to update the system and keep accurate network time. Any other cleranet access by other applications will add unnecessary risk.</p>
<p>Since we are applying this policy to Kicksecure (with the important caveat that non anonymous traffic is allowed) this shouldn’t seem controversial a decision IMHO.</p>

<p>That it’s the state of things anyhow. Whonix-Host and Whonix-Gateway<br>
running separate Tor. A lot easier to implement than Whonix-Host using<br>

<p>What about the cases users need to use different gateway / tor configuration?</p>
<p>For example, today users can use another Gateway when using onionshare. Another disadvantage will be the lack of snapshots that makes it easier to recover from mistakes in configurations.</p>
<p>In general I agree with <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/onion_knight">@onion_knight</a>’s view. Whonix host as a hardened debian / pre-installed Whonix, Tor connections only within the VMs.</p>

<p>The way I understand it, Whonix Host is “merely” a hardened debian with installed and configured KVM Whonix-Gateway/Workstation VMs with virt-manager.</p>
<p>But network shouldnot be torified.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>May be installed anywhere anyhow, providing debian hardened security + Whonix VM for Tor activities</li>
<li>Do not connect to Tor by default unless the user wants it -&gt; avoiding dangerous situations for the user, ensuring ubiquity</li>
<li>Torifiying the Host does not seem useful as Tor is already provided by the Whonix VMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This being said maybe torifying the network connections could be chosen by the user, not bye default</p>

        <title>Should Whonix host be fully torified by default?</title>

            <p>Fully torified would mean routing all traffic over Tor which would result in Tor over Tor when using a Whonix VM. Something that isn’t wanted.</p>
<p>Routing only some traffic over Tor (e.g. apt) would be good in my opinion as it anonymizes the host instead of just the VMs.</p>
<p>No torification cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An attacker could see what packages you have installed and have better idea of what exploits to use as apt isn’t torified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User might use the network on the host and do something like visit a website, potentially deanonymizing them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User might install other software and will be deanonymized if that software phones home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISP or anyone else monitoring the network can analyse all untorified traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No torification pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Faster speeds for the host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No extra configuration required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need for troubleshooting Tor on the host.</p>
</li>
</ul>
