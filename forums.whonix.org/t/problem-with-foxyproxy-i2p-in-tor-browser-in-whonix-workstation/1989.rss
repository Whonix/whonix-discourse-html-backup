    <title>problem with FoxyProxy / I2P in Tor Browser in Whonix-Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/problem-with-foxyproxy-i2p-in-tor-browser-in-whonix-workstation/1989</link>
    <description>Hello, This board pissed me off so much it did not send the activation mails to my E-mails (and i had to make github account for it like a little noob) -.-----

My question is, I am trying to setup i2p on tor &gt; whonix workstation, and i got it working and everything, 

But whenever i try to install FoxyProxy, I cannot even see it on the list, so when i do insight search it pops up first,

Then when i try to download it it will never download,

It says that you cant install this add-on on this because its not TOR???

WTF IS LIFE -.-


Another explanation;

I was trying to install i2p on whonix workstation,



I got it working with the router up and running linking to the i2p page,



However im stuck on something where the Add-On called FoxyProxy will not install in the Tor browser at all...



It does not even identify the browser as Tor :/



Anybody with Whonix experience please contact me.</description>

            <p>I guess im confused with the whonix default Tor Browser,</p>
<p>Where as I need another Tor Browser installed to be able to edit that ones proxy and leave the whonix default one for browsing dark web…</p>
<p>Could anybody elaborate a little more on installing an additional Tor Browser to Whonix-Workstation so that i am able to i2p on?</p>
<p>Maby thats my problem afterall, im using the default one which is very secure and wont allow any addons or something?</p>
<p>When you wrote “Tested on Tor - Hardened,” it clicked in my mind that i have the wrong version? (normally when i access the dark web, and open Tor, I see the WHONIX page with a search engine, so please correct my confusions if you can.</p>

            <p>Tested foxyproxy on latest TBB and working successfully.</p>
<p>I2P isn’t buggy in my experience. I2P needs 5 minutes after starting to bootstrap. before its ready. Also its recommended to configure it like it says in the documentation.</p>

            <p>Please don’t substitute writing <code>Tor</code> when you mean <code>Tor Browser</code> or the confusion will be perfect. These are two different software packages by the same vendor (The Tor Project [TPO]).</p>
<p>I also recommend read this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support#General_Advice">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support#General_Advice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Needs screenshots or video. Specific instructions on how to reproduce this.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/</a> works for me . Installs just fine in Tor Browser <code>5.5a6-hardened</code>. And also seems to work. (Configured it to use socks 127.0.0.1 9050 [which is redirected to the gateway] which worked as expected. Failed with http 127.0.0.1 9050 or 127.0.0.1 9100 as expected. So everything seems fine.)</p>
<p>As explained under Free Support Principle, we do not develop Tor Browser. So please make sure the issue you are reporting would also apply to Tor Browser on plain Debian, which it most likely would. Upstream (The Tor Project) might change something about Tor Browser and its proxy settings which might very well break foxyproxy. However, this is outside the control of the Whonix team. Differences between Tor Browser on Debian and Tor Browser inside Whonix-Workstation are marginal [ <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_in_Whonix_differences">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser#Tor_Browser_in_Whonix_differences</a> ]. Therefore this is unlikely being caused by Whonix.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>Yes I used 2 differnet emails outlook/hotmail, whonix forums was never sending activation links to them,…</p>
<p>Also for the FoxyProxy,</p>
<p>(we need a tutorial on it on youtube)</p>
<p>You did not tell me any good advice,</p>
<p>I am trying to put I2p on tor, while on whonix workstation.</p>
<p>This is very buggy and the addons dont even install on the Whonix-Workstation Tor browser.</p>
<p>I did insert the proxy manually, but i2p is buggy as fuck, it says timed out connection on every opened page on it.</p>
<p>I dont know if this is from the wrong manual proxy insertion, or I NEED FOXYPROXY with it (which i cant install)</p>
<p>I hope you understand my point of view</p>

<p>But whenever i try to install FoxyProxy, I cannot even see it on the list, so when i do insight search it pops up first,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is a quote from foxyproxy website:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a common misunderstanding that Tor is required to use FoxyProxy. This is not true. FoxyProxy has nothing to do with Tor. FoxyProxy is not Tor. FoxyProxy does not require Tor (this list<br>
has FoxyProxy’s requirements). If used with Tor, FoxyProxy efficiently<br>
loads only the URLs you define through the slow Tor network. All other<br>
URLs load through your direct internet connection or other proxies, as<br>
you define. The benefit of using FoxyProxy with Tor is simply that you<br>
can use your fast internet connection to load normal URLs and the Tor<br>
network to load sensitive URLs without constantly changing Firefox proxy<br>
settings.</p>

<p>u can add 127.0.0.1:4444 inside Tor by this direction:- (similarly for firefox)</p>
<p>open the menu -&gt; preferences -&gt; advanced -&gt; network - &gt; settings… -&gt; then choose manual proxy configuration and add i2p proxies.</p>
