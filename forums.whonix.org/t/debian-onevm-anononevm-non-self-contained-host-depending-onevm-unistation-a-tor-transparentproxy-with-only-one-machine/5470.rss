    <description>Sometimes I am considering to deploy:

* a plain Debian-OneVM, just Debian ova / libvirt / raw images ready for download and use inside virtualizers.
* a self-contained Anon-OneVM (less security, but easier to deploy and use)
* the [non-self-contained, host-depending OneVM](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OneVM) concept which depends on the host is unattractive (complicated, less security). 

Maybe there is better naming than OneVM?

----

Deploying a self-contained Anon-OneVM looks close because:

* Whonix-Gateway&#39;s own traffic has always been torified. I expect it&#39;s doable effort to think and code it through more to make it into a secure, anonymous Anon-OneVM .

On the other hand, deploying a self-contained Anon-OneVM is unlikely because:

* would require rebranding so it won&#39;t get confused with Whonix
* would require a separate project page distinct from the Whonix brand to avoid generating confusion (separate project, separate website, wiki, issue tracker, forum?)
* lack of time

----

Deploying a plain Debian-OneVM has still faint hope:

* doesn&#39;t require much added maintenance burden
* would probably just a project page on some project hosting website ([gitlab or something](https://phabricator.whonix.org/T800))
* low support project: only answering to good bug reports and pull requests, otherwise not giving support</description>

<p>Also looks like while Debian does a great job at making it possible to fix Spectre/Meltdown there is as it looks to me a discrepancy since they won’t go as far as installing some diagnostic tool by default which tests if Spectre/Meltdown is actually patched like we do in Whonix with whonixcheck to make sure they fixes also actually reach users. They also don’t enable apparmor by default. Debian is a great toolbox which I am going to use to create a preconfigured product.</p>

<p>A fair point. We do go well beyond the default and at least for a first time install there are a lot of knobs to be turned for a default Debian. I could really do without having to do this - this project would be perfect. Will you support physical hardware for host installs if this picks up?</p>

            <p>If such a project is indeed doable with minimal effort then it would be worth it to attract more users. I imagine a modified WS would be least path to resistance than modifying GW.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that a separate project page/brand is warranted. A clear disclaimer on the download page and a self evident name is enough.</p>
<p>There is also another potential project our packages are good for. A hardened vanilla Debian guest that is VM friendly with a TBB version that can use the clearnet. IMO such a project may have traction in the enterprise world.</p>
<p>Naming:<br>
UniStation or Whonix Omni<br>
For vanilla project: ClearnetVM</p>

            <p>It wouldn’t be called gateway anymore. It would be a separate build/VM/project.</p>
<p>corridor is not defeating malware.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rustybird/corridor#pitfalls">https://github.com/rustybird/corridor#pitfalls</a></p>
<p>Only a safety net. And if that project was to prioritize usability over security/anonymity, then don’t mention difficult things like corridor.</p>
<p>Otherwise it would be feature complete, Tor Browser, IRC, all.</p>
<p>Recommendation that there is a more secure project makes sense.</p>

<p>An interesting idea. (Wouldn’t be called workstation anymore.) Development effort could be smaller. The code delta might also be smaller that way. Hard to foresee development effort either way.</p>

            <p>Regarding usability. This is certainly true. Still there should be some warning that this setup is the less secure option + maybe give some hints about hardening the host. Maybe something like installing/enabling corridor on the host when using OneVM. The question, which you can probably answer best, is also how feature complete the gateway or workstation should be. I.e. install torbrowser and maybe IRC and other programs on the gateway. Or make torification directly on the Workstation. Not sure how much work this actually would be. Maybe as simple as installing the gw firewall package + timesync + connection wizard?</p>

            <p>So in contrast to the linked OneVM setup torification will be done on the VM and not on the host? Imho usecases boil down to people with older computers and mostly to something like low RAM. The number of those people will decrease over time and without GUI you can run the gateway with quite low RAM. So it would be a difference of 256-512 MB  RAM for OneVM vs   the current setup. I’m not sure if it will make much of a difference CPU wise. Most posts here where something lagged were due to RAM. If it is only one VM then only one can break. But then you need to maintain it in addition to the other ones and the security is not much different from Tails.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I am considering to deploy:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plain Debian-OneVM, just Debian ova / libvirt / raw images ready for download and use inside virtualizers.</li>
<li>a self-contained Anon-OneVM (less security, but easier to deploy and use)</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/OneVM">non-self-contained, host-depending OneVM</a> concept which depends on the host is unattractive (complicated, less security).</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe there is better naming than OneVM?</p>
<hr>
<p>Deploying a self-contained Anon-OneVM looks close because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whonix-Gateway’s own traffic has always been torified. I expect it’s doable effort to think and code it through more to make it into a secure, anonymous Anon-OneVM .</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, deploying a self-contained Anon-OneVM is unlikely because:</p>
<ul>
<li>would require rebranding so it won’t get confused with Whonix</li>
<li>would require a separate project page distinct from the Whonix brand to avoid generating confusion (separate project, separate website, wiki, issue tracker, forum?)</li>
<li>lack of time</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Deploying a plain Debian-OneVM has still faint hope:</p>
<ul>
<li>doesn’t require much added maintenance burden</li>
<li>would probably just a project page on some project hosting website (<a href="https://phabricator.whonix.org/T800">gitlab or something</a>)</li>
<li>low support project: only answering to good bug reports and pull requests, otherwise not giving support</li>
</ul>
