&gt; As HTTPS deployment grows, middlebox and antivirus products are increasingly intercepting TLS connections to retain visibility into network traffic. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the prevalence and impact of HTTPS interception. 
&gt; 
&gt; First, we show that web servers can detect interception by identifying a mismatch between the HTTP User-Agent header and  TLS client behavior. We characterize the TLS handshakes of  major browsers and popular interception products, which we use  to build a set of heuristics to detect interception and identify the responsible product. We deploy these heuristics at three large network providers: (1) Mozilla Firefox update servers, (2) a set of popular e-commerce sites, and (3) the  Cloudflare content distribution network. 
&gt; 
&gt; We find more than an order of magnitude more interception than previously estimated and with dramatic impact on connection security. To understand why security suffers, **we investigate popular middleboxes and client-side security software, finding that nearly all reduce connection security and many introduce severe vulnerabilities.** Drawing on our measurements, we conclude with a discussion on recent proposals to safely monitor HTTPS and recommendations for the security community.</description>

            <p>ZAP_2.7.0_Linux – I use it all the time if I feel something fishy.  Also the old Perspective Add-on for Icecat or Gibson Research fingerprinting.  <a href="https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.grc.com/fingerprints.htm</a><br>
Or the DNS NSA servers that start with 0 etc…  (they might be listed under Google).<br>
Of course I can’t wait for Windows 13 Chinese Home Edition to keep me safe…</p>

            <p>I’d agree if HTTPS was considered security in the first place. Any CA mediated secure connection is potentially MITM’d. Except Tor which has the keys built-in</p>
