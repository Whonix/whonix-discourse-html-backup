            <blockquote>There are two parts here.
<ul>
<li>command line support in libvirt</li>
<li>gui support in virt-manager</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Details at the moment are scant its still in early stages, but as a standalone library its intended to be used behind multiple gui management interfaces besides Gnome Boxes so <span class="hashtag">#2</span> is in the cards.</p>
<p>As for commanline support I didn’t ask TBH.</p>

            <p>Please update the tickets on <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/KVM">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/KVM</a>. I would like to have this page for contributors to show what else can be done. Duplicating effort by me or someone else would be a pity.</p>

Good catch. Deleting is not required. Documenting and referencing the risk should be sufficient.</p>

            <p>I forgot to mention in that post that at the time I did correspond with the devs behind Gnome Boxes and libvirt to ask about the design of the import library for our needs. I was told that Its in its early stages.</p>
<p>Its encouraging to know that this is in progress.</p>

<p>Its in the works.</p>
<p>Libguestfs is about inspecting files and controlling daemons inside a guest image - not relevant. But one thing that should be mentioned for security is to never load a guest disk image directly on the host without the hypervisor. Libguestfs is the only safe method advocated for if its a must but that has its pitfalls and should not be used if not necessary.</p>
