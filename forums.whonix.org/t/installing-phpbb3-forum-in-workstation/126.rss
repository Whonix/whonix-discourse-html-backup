    <title>Installing PhpBB3 forum in Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-phpbb3-forum-in-workstation/126</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I am very new in Whonix and I&#39;d like to say it&#39;s a very good work.
By now I am testing with the version 7.
I have an Ubuntu host with the two VMs inside (Gateway+Workstation), I have activated the hidden service and installed a forum (PhpBB3).
everything is working, I have access to the forum in the Tor network.
My problem is that I cannot send emails from the Workstation. I have reconfigured exim in the Workstation but when I send an email from the forum or from the command line I have a &quot;host lookup did not complete&quot; message in the exim&#39;s log. 
I don&#39;t know if this is the right place for this question.... I have searched and I have found out that the problem is in the /etc/resolv.conf and I have to change the resolvers.
so my question is, what do I have to do to resolve the host lookup of exim? what are the risks of changing the nameservers in the resolv.conf (Gateway)?
can I put opendns for example? or is it something else I am doing wrong??

I will appreciate any answer to clear my problem...

thanks</description>

<p>Like I said, I tested and got the same message… I don’t have error messages when I send, like in phpBB, it sends, but looking in the log of exim4 “host lookup did not complete” in real the email is not sended…</p>

<p>You’re right… no complications… I use the php mail() function in a normal forum or website and works… So I wanted to understand if I have to do a configuration in Whonix to get it working… So, like I said, I am very new… and didn’t know about the forum mailers in .onion.</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick, and thank you very much for your fast answer…</p>
<p>I have downloaded Whonix 8 and I am planning to migrate all my tests to the new version.<br>
Thank you again for all the information, I have made a test with Mixmaster with the same message “host lookup did not complete” .<br>
Any way, I tried changing to openDns in the Workstation and nothing.<br>
I will read your suggestion “/wiki/Secondary_DNS_Resolver”.</p>
<p>I only want to send emails using php mail() (forum PhpBB3) and I’m not searching for complicated configurations.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the help and suggestions… I’ll give it a try…<br>
So if anyone have made an installation of phpBB3 in Whonix-Workstation your suggestions are welcome either…</p>
<p>thanx</p>

            <p>Whonix 7 is no longer supported. Please use Whonix 8 instead. Your problem however is likely (not impossible) not related to Whonix 7 vs Whonix 8.</p>
<p>Since it’s very Whonix specific, it’s ok to ask here.</p>
<p>Don’t make change to Whonix-Gateway’s /etc/resolv.conf. It does not affect hidden services. It also does not affect how Whonix-Workstation is resolving DNS. (System DNS from Whonix-Workstation, i.e. /etc/resolv.conf are redirected to Tor’s DnsPort running on Whonix-Gateway. Socksified Whonix-Workstation such as XChat are using a Tor SocksPort running on Whonix-Gateway, which also supports resolving DNS.)</p>
<p>Experimenting with /etc/resolv.conf on Whonix-Workstation is safer than the above, though.</p>
<p>I can’t give you step by step instructions on how to solve this. But outline a few approaches. Let us know if you succeeded.</p>
<p>Getting SMTP to work over Tor will be difficult anyway due to limitations in Tor. (No extra limitations by Whonix. If anything, Whonix makes it simpler to find a solution to such issues without IP leaks.)</p>
<ol>
<li>many Tor exit relays are blocking popular SMTP ports. I don’t know if there are any Tor exit relays supporting popular SMTP ports. Last time I checked there were. Finding this out is left as an exercise for the reader to find out, please tell us your results.</li>
<li>Tor does not support MX DNS requests yet, which are required for e-mail over Tor. (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Remailer">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Remailer</a> (probably not that helpful)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Mixmaster">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Mixmaster</a> (eventually you can somehow develop mixmaster to send your mails, not sure how reliable it would be, probably not trivial to configure your web app to do this)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Mixmaster">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Mixmaster</a> (talks a bit about the MX DNS and Tor issue)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Deprecated#Mixmaster">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Deprecated#Mixmaster</a> (was a hacky attempt to resolve MX over Tor)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Secondary_DNS_Resolver">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Secondary_DNS_Resolver</a> (probably helpful, you can use third party DNS resolvers from within Whonix-Workstation to resolve MX DNS)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/HostingLocationHiddenServices">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/HostingLocationHiddenServices</a> (using VPN with Remote Port Forwarding  or pagekite) might give you outgoing e-mail connectivity</li>
