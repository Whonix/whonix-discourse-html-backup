    <title>[Solved] higher resolution problem</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-higher-resolution-problem/252</link>
    <description>I reviewed the higher wiki/Higher_Screen_Resolution page and made the xorg.conf.d/00-virtualbox-monitor.conf (first the dir, then the file) and copy pasted from the wiki page into the 00-virtualbox-monitor.conf changing only the Option &quot;PreferredMode&quot; &quot;1600x1200&quot; line to the resolution that I wanted then rebooted but no change so I wanted to check what things I might be doing wrong (i did this in whonix not the host OS i assume). When i rebooted it booted a command prompt and not into xwin/kde, not sure why. I know if in the gateway if i lower the mem in virtbox it will boot to a command prompt but this computer supports a fairly high rez and I am just wanting fairly modest (just a bit more than 1024x768) increase. 

Only two questions I can think of are #1 I am pretty sure this was supposed to be done in whonix? but perhaps I am wrong? maybe the host OS? #2 in the 00-virtualbox-monitor.conf are there any other lines that should be modified?

I also tried the line:

vboxmanage setextradata &quot;VM Name&quot; &quot;CustomVideoMode1&quot; &quot;1440x900x32&quot;

putting in the &quot;Whonix-Workstation&quot; for the &quot;VM Name&quot; (which was the default name) and the rez I wanted for &quot;1440x900x32&quot; on my host Linux OS but still nada when i rebooted whonix.

Not sure here, suggestions?</description>

            <p>Yes, but you’re most likely better off making this a non-Whonix, general Debian or Ubuntu VM question. (The issue there will be the same, but less people will falsely assume this is a Whonix inducted issue.)</p>

            <p>doh… thanks for the reply. So do you think it would be worth trying to post over at the virtual box forum?</p>

<p>Correct.</p>

The mechanism that decides whether kdm gets started or not is called RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter. I doubt it is the problem. All it does when there is enough RAM, is "sudo service kdm start" - you can also manually try to start kdm. However, this probably won't be the issue here.

Yes.

That one on the host. (But you probably know that already.)
<blockquote>Not sure here, suggestions?</blockquote>
No, sorry.
