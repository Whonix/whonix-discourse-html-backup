    <title>UI/UX Design of Website and Wiki</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/ui-ux-design-of-website-and-wiki/15967</link>
    <description>## Overview
I have been doing some research on other FOSS privacy tool projects, and had a very nice conversation with a person who was on the privacyguides.org team. He pointed out that UX/UI could be improved upon a lot on the main site/wiki, and thinks doing so would have a meaningful impact on usage and interest in Whonix.

I agree with this sentiment, and would like to help.

#### Ideas

Firstly, I think that many of the stock images and graphics take away a bit from the usability of the site. If you look at grapheneos.org, it has a very simple layout with straightforward &quot;click and install&quot; front and center. I think something like this is a great idea for the Whonix site.

IMO many of the stock images and logos are a bit dated, and a little cheesy. This is not intended to be a dig at anyone who did this work, and the Whonix site is an AMAZING resource. I simply think it could benefit from a bit of tidying up. 

Secondly, I am curious how the pages are hosted? The wiki is easy to find, but what about the home page? I think having a singular website repo using a static site generator (jekyll, hugo, etc) would be a good way to standardize the layout and increase maintainability. This would make it easier to focus on documentation and HTML/CSS separately.

Lastly, I think the welcome page in TOR should ask for donations front and center, in the same way that TAILS does. TAILS project kindly requests donations and saying something similar to this &quot;Whonix is entirely free, and relies on user donations. If all users of Whonix gave just $5, we could make a great impact in keeping users free and secure for many years to come.&quot;

#### Commitment

After I get my CI project running WATS, I am happy to tackle this project, and get the site more concise and clean. My partner is a graphic designer, and I could probably get a little bit of help with some custom/unified graphics on some areas that might need them. 

It would be nice as this unfolds to try to discern outdated information and what needs to be archived

Thanks for taking the time to read :sunglasses:</description>

    Many stock images such as on lets’s say for example <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others" class="inline-onebox">Anonymity Operating System Comparison - Whonix ™ vs Tails vs Tor Browser Bundle</a> (which is this image <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File:Balance-154516-640.png" class="inline-onebox">File:Balance-154516-640.png - Whonix</a> at time of writing) are indeed not very customized. These are more of a stopgap than perfect. But that stopgap could go on for years. 
Would it be better to have no such thumbnail than a just only good enough one? I think it’s useful to have one that is at least good enough than not having one at all. That is…
