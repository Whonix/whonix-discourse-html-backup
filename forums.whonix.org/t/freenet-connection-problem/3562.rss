    <title>Freenet connection problem</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/freenet-connection-problem/3562</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m completely new to Whonix. I have setup a dedicated Debian system with VirtualBox and Whonix WS and GW. Accessing Tor workes without any problems.
In the last few days I&#39;ve tried Freenet. I&#39;ve cloned a clean WS and followed the instructions here: [https://www.whonix.org/wiki/freenet](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/freenet). Everything worked fine until I came to &quot;Usage&quot;. When I restarted the Tor Browser with [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) Freenet showed up indeed and I was able to do the inial configuration. But when I tried to browse to a freesite nothing happened. The number of nodes always showed 0/28 and I got a message that the Freesite could not be loaded.
What am I doing wrong? Are there further settings which are not described in the wiki? I guess the Freenet configuration was a offline thing so I would never have had a connection to it.

Thanks for your efforts

            <p>Sorry, I couldn’t answer earlier. I overlooked the tunneling of Tor mentioned at the beginning of the WIKI.<br>
I’m going to catch up on this next week (holidays). Doesn’t seem to be easy. On the other hand Freenet isn’t so much important to me.<br>
Thanks again.<br>

<p>You need to tunnel it thru a VPN for it to connect. It does say that on the wiki.</p>

            <p>Did you know that Freenet uses UDP connections, while Tor uses TCP? To use the Freenet client in Whonix, you will have to  <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnel_UDP_over_Tor" rel="nofollow noopener">Tunnel UDP over Tor</a>. You might have overlooked that.</p>
