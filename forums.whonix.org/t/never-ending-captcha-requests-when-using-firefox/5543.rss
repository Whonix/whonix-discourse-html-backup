    <title>Never-ending CAPTCHA requests when using Firefox</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/never-ending-captcha-requests-when-using-firefox/5543</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently started using Whonix in a virtual machine. They are basically &#39;fresh installs&#39; in that I&#39;ve done little except import the gateway and workstation into virtualbox and installed TOR in the workstation. 

Every time I do a search in Firefox, I am prompted to complete a CAPTCHA due to the &#39;unusual traffic&#39; that has been detected. These CAPTCHAs don&#39;t seem to work, and I have literally done them several dozen times without ever being able to go to the site(s) I was wanting to.

I can search for things in search engines easily enough - when I am using duckduckgo, but whenever I try to go to a site... never-ending CAPTCHA requests...

What could be causing this? And how do I fix it?

This doesn&#39;t seem to happen when using TOR - only Firefox.</description>

            <p>Hm this doesn’t make sense. Tor Browser is mostly FF and in your setup they both use Tor. What you’re doing is pseudoanonymity at best.</p>

            <p>If it wasn’t so frigging slow, it wouldn’t be so infuriating to use. I do use it, but it would be nice to have something that was faster than a 1990s dial up connection…</p>

            <p>CAPTCHA checks are aggressive for Tor &amp; Proxy/VPN users. It started probably around two or three years ago with Cloudflare. Cloudflare was citing that nearly 100% of traffic from the Tor network as malicious. The Tor Project started diplomacy with them shortly after that to reach a solution. Google/Alphabet routinely uses CAPTCHA as well; and they are intertwined with <em>many</em> websites. Some websites allow CAPTCHA checks without javascript enabled, but most of them are designed to fail unless you allow scripts.</p>
<p>Sometimes accessing sites with a vanilla browser (but still behind a proxy) will get an easy pass, since there are so many fingerprinting vectors for the site to analyze and decide if you are a bot. Not a very good solution from the user perspective, you might only want to do that in a disposable workstation.</p>

<li>
<p>You shouldn’t use vanilla Firefox because it lacks the tracking protections of Tor Browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloudflare is recently whitelisting the Tor Browser user-agent for most of their clients and so any other browser coming from the Tor network will run into their CAPTCHA wall.</p>
