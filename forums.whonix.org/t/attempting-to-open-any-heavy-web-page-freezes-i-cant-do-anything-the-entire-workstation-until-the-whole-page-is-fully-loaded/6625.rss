Attempting to open any heavy web-page freezes(i cant do anything) the entire workstation until the whole page is fully loaded. (maps.google required 2 min waitnig. attempting to open rambler.ru while 2 tabs of google-maps still opened makes computer shutdown in case of owerheating)
1gb ram for xfce gateway, 4gb ram for xfce workstation
Whith similar settings on whonix-13 everything works perfect (more than 15 heavy tabs loading at the same time did not affected on workstation)
Already reinstalled station and gateway twice :3 
Does anyone had this problem? Is it fixable?</description>

    The problems many have noticed with TBB performance with current VM  configurations are all traceable to Firefox’s transition to a multiprocess model. One solution is to simply push up VM resource allocation. Meanwhile a more pragmatic solution is to change the behavior of the software to become more efficient. We lose out on upstream sandboxing work whenever it materializes, but we have firejail to make up for it.

            <p>I have redused ram on gateway to 256mb, multiprocess on station’s tor to 1, now with 5700mb ram on workstation its works just a little bit better, but thank you anyway.</p>
<p>Why 14 wersion of whinix uses more ram then 13? On 13 even with 2gb ram workstation works better, than 14 with 5700mb?</p>

            <p>Hi <code>huhhah</code></p>
<p>This could be a low RAM issue. Large pages using most of the resources. Try adding additional RAM to Whonix-Workstation with rads. You can also terminate any unneeded processes on the host to free up RAM if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter</a></p>
<p>This could also be related to Tor Browser E10/multiprocess which can affect performance.</p>
