    <title>Firewall issues KVM Kicksecure</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/firewall-issues-kvm-kicksecure/10022</link>
    <description>I&#39;m guessing this is a firewall issue, in Kicksecure the internet works I can update just fine, but when I open secbrowser theres no connection, other applications like brave browser can&#39;t connect either.

I think this is a firewall issue that popped up recently also in whonix, in whonix workstation I notice that brave browser can&#39;t connect probably because of the firewall as well.

The only application I know of that is working is torbrowser in whonix, everything else seems to fail to connect. Also I am not familiar with whatever firewall system kicksecure is using and couldn&#39;t even figure out what firewall it has. How would I make applications such secbrowser and brave be able to work properly?

Extra info: Host is manjaro, but everything was working fine on manjaro before</description>

            <p>Kicksecure does not come with firewall rules last time I checked. Both Kicksecure and Whonix come with iptables.</p>
<p>See existing rules with <code>$ sudo iptables -S</code></p>
<p>This might be more likely to be an issue with your host. However, Whonix does have something called a TransPort (transparent proxy) that is possible to be disabled. If it is, user-installed programs might have to be configured manually before they connect.</p>
