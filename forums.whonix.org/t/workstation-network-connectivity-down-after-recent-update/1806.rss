    <description>This is a repost, but the original thread I tacked onto isn&#39;t showing in the support category so not sure if anyone will see it. It is here:
https://forums.whonix.org/t/so-i-do-the-100-pack-update-and-now-i-have-no-working-internet-in-workstation/1780/16

I had another network problem on my gateway after the update, which 
was resolved by editing /etc/network/interfaces 
(https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonixcheck-fail-tor-pid-does-not-exist-after-upgrade-from-whonix-11-to-whonix-12/1793/12)

Everything seemed to be working for a day or two after that. Then I&#39;m
 not sure if it was after a reset or when it happened but I have lost 
network connection on my Workstation. Gateway still has a connection. I 
did not touch Workstation networking.

Whonixcheck on Gateway comes back all good. 
Whonixcheck on workstation &quot;ERROR: Tor Boostrap Result: Tor&#39;s Control 
Port could not be reached!&quot;

ifconfig looks correct on both as far as I can tell, but haven&#39;t tried anything else besides rebooting.</description>

            <p>That was the same solution as my Gateway problem. I did not even think to look at that.<br>
Worked like a charm.</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick responses Patrick!</p>
