    <description>Hi everyone. First, sorry ! for my bad english, but it isn&#39;t my main language :confused:

So, yesterday night all worked fine and I went to sleep. Today morning I started the Whonix Gateway, works fine. But the workstation isn&#39;t working. Get this message at booting:

I doesn&#39;t modified the settings since yesterday, but not working. I tried to give more RAM, but the VirtualBox write an error message, because can&#39;t lock enough memory (Yeah, I doesn&#39;t have too much ram. Yestarday i run the workstation with 1600 MB ram and 4 cpu core)</description>

            <p>It looks like it can’t find init for some reason.</p>
<p>When starting the VM, when you get to the boot menu, press <code>e</code> before booting, scroll down to the line that starts with <code>linux</code> and ends with <code>mds=full,nosmt</code>. At the end of that line try adding <code>init=/sbin/init</code> and press Ctrl + X on your keyboard. Does that fix it?</p>

            <p>Hello, welcome to Whonix forums and thank you for your question! <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t know. Can only speculate. Could be, that the (virtual) hard drive got corrupted. In this case, repair and/or data recovery is difficult. Hopefuls you have a backup of data if any. I suggest to delete that Whonix-Workstation and to re-import it (easiest).</p>
