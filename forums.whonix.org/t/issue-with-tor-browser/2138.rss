    <description>so tor is the defult browser within whonix. OK, but I have so many issues using it withing Whonix..many places will not allow me to visit their sites..and on top of that, if they do, they have verification pages that will not process no matter how many times I enter the correct passphrase. This sucks..is there a work around?</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>sorry to tell you, but the TBB is not at vault here. It’s rather the exit node you used got blocked by the provider of the site. This happens regardless of the browser. To pass those verifications you’ll have to activate JavaScript temporarily.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
