    <title>New Whonix Installer Release</title>

		&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;About a year ago, the first version of the &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenSpellError&quot;&gt;Whonix&lt;/span&gt; Installer for Windows was made available to the public. Since then, there has been a continuous effort to find ways to make the process simpler, more reliable and less taxing for computers with little disk space. This effort now culminates in the release of a new Installer, build from the ground up with these things in mind. Based on InnoSetup instead of &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenSpellError&quot;&gt;NSIS&lt;/span&gt;, it is far better suited to the task of handling the large files &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenSpellError&quot;&gt;Whonix&lt;/span&gt; requires.

Additionally, the compilation process has been turned into a one step process, so anyone may create his or her own binary.

The new version may be downloaded from here: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/windows

Note that it is not required to reinstall &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenSpellError&quot;&gt;Whonix&lt;/span&gt; with the new installer, if you&#39;ve used the previous one. However, please remember to continuously update both &lt;span class=&quot;hiddenSpellError&quot;&gt;Whonix&lt;/span&gt; and VirtualBox.</description>
