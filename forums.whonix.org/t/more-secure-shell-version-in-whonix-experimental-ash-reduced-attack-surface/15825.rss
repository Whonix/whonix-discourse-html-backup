    <title>more secure shell version in whonix experimental - ash - reduced attack surface</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/more-secure-shell-version-in-whonix-experimental-ash-reduced-attack-surface/15825</link>
    <description>good idea for current whonix but whonix in general needs to have seperate branches, one for current whonix (stable) and other for &quot;experiments&quot; where maintainers can just put ash or dash or bash or zsh without starting a discussion then putting a download link to for testing/bug hunting under some kind &quot;Experimental&quot; page in wiki/download page

the shell in that version (experimental) should be ash due low amount of code and good security track when compared to bash/zsh</description>

<p>you don’t have a say in that and you are not a developer, and won’t be due fact you cannot code nor script shown by your clear lack of ability to comprehend that ash is more POSIX compliant than Bash and Zsh and is not cluttered with bugs. it is not too late to start learning basic scripting but mean time stay away from security stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HISTORY<br>
dash is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as small as possible.  dash is a<br>
direct descendant of the NetBSD version of ash (the Almquist SHell), ported to Linux in early 1997.<br>
It was renamed to dash in 2002.</p>

<p>Ash (mainly the Dash fork) is also fairly popular in embedded Linux systems. Dash version 0.3.8-5 was incorporated into BusyBox, the catch-all executable often employed in this area, and is used in distributions like DSLinux, Alpine Linux, Tiny Core Linux and Linux-based router firmware such as OpenWrt, Tomato and DD-WRT.

<p>ash is fork of dash actively maintained low size because low code but less shell specific features</p>

            <p>as for “experimental” i meant that currently whonix doesnt release “Experimental” builds where the maintainers are given more freedom to add and remove stuff as they see fit and things that stick long enough get moved to next “stable” whonix release i mean</p>

            <p>posix is not bible lol all of these shells have different code and wont run ur script unless its pretty basic, though most code works fine across them, quite few do not work well if just slam shell code to another shell lol</p>
<p>ash is minimal in terms of code and thus reduced attack surface<br>
your many eyes bash had a bug in it called shellshock, not very secure huh?</p>
<p>i am talking pure security here, ash is not dash and is actively maintained</p>

            <p>What has a greater attack surface:</p>
<ul>
<li>outdated, archived, unmaintained, old implementation of the Bourne Shel with Debian <code>dash</code> (<code>ash</code> for debian), with known vulnerabilities. Dash man page was last written in 2003.</li>
<li>updated, maintained, widely developed, feature rich shell <code>zsh</code> where security bugs are still being fixed</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>whonix in general needs another much more secure version called experimental</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not sure what you mean by a more secure version called experimental, but if that version is ash almost all shells can run in Posix Compliant mode, the same code can be run on all of them, an attacker does not care if your interactive shell is Zsh, Bash, Dash, Ash, Sh, Ksh, Csh, as long as their code is POSIX, it will be able to exploit your machine.</p>
<p>But if you are saying a targeted exploit to your interactive shell called Zsh, but no other shell, then that is a targeted attack, and if you have an enemy that can use that kinda of attack, that no shell will protect you, not Zsh nor Ash.</p>
<p>Whonix can’t make a restrictive shell user friendly. Try <code>rbash</code> (Restrictive Bash, read the man).</p>
<p>Open to be proven wrong.</p>

            <p>good idea for current whonix but whonix in general needs to have seperate branches, one for current whonix (stable) and other for “experiments” where maintainers can just put ash or dash or bash or zsh without starting a discussion then putting a download link to for testing/bug hunting under some kind “Experimental” page in wiki/download page</p>
<p>the shell in that version (experimental) should be ash due low amount of code and good security track when compared to bash/zsh</p>
