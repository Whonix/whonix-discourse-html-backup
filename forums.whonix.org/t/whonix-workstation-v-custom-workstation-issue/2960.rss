    <description>What could cause the following and is there anything I could do to speed things up.

Scenario a = Whonix Gateway &gt; Whonix Workstation. I have a website installed on a nginx server, it communicates with a mysql database and the average page loading times are really slow, it&#39;s taking around 40+ seconds from my testing it seems to be the communication between the webapp and the mysql database which is causing the slow loading times.

Scenario b = Whonix Gateway &gt; Debain vm forced to use Whonix Gateway to torifry traffic. The exact same website, server settings and mysql settings. Now my loading times are down to 5-10 seconds a lot faster and manageable for a tor hidden service.

Scenario c = Standalone Debian vm. The exact same website, server settings and mysql settings, the page load times are almost instant.

I have no problem with the Scenario b loading times, I just want to get Scenario a down to the same loading times. In scenario b the custom debain vm is still been forced to use the Whonix Gateway so I really don&#39;t know why the workstation in scenario a is so much slower to load my pages. I really wanted to use both Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation to run a hidden service but I feel those loading times will drive people away

In all 3 scenarios the vm are using the same amount of ram.

Is there a reason for this? Is there a possible way to fix it? Finally would an upgrade to a SSD fix scenario a? I don&#39;t want to pay the upgrade fee if it would have no bearing on the loading times.</description>

            <p>Hi I reinstalled everything and it’s working like a charm, same speed as the custom workstation so i really don’t know what caused the issue but it’s now working.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the help and patience.</p>

<p>Thanks for testing - very useful information and surprising indeed. This rules out Whonix and the qcow2 disk settings so I can only conclude its a strange, machine specific quirk you ran into.</p>

<p>That’s a good option. Please let me know if that fixes anything.</p>

            <p>Oh that makes sense, I’ll take a small side effect such as this for increased security :).</p>
<p>I do indeed run them both fully updated, what’s even more strange I tested simple machine forums and that has no performance issue under the Whonix machine at all, it just loads and works fast.</p>
<p>It can’t be the code(laravel app) though as it’s working lighting fast under a regular vm and still pretty fast under the custom Debian version. I’m feeling more relaxed now I know the custom Debian version can’t have any dns leaks, it’s just to host a hidden service soit won’t be used for browsing, the hidden service is fully legal but I still wanted to make sure that it would be secure enough and that the vm thinks 10.152.152.10/11 is it’s own ip address with no dns leaks and it seems it is indeed.</p>
<p>I’ll upgrade to 8.6</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and help.</p>

<p>Yes the reason for that is that I removed ACPI to get rid of the fine grained timer acpi_pm. This is important for security but the side effect is you cannot gracefully shutdown machines anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also tested the custom conf on my Whonix Workstation but it’s still taking around 30-40 seconds to load my webpages, if I was to use the custom version on a custom vm to host a hidden service, am I correcting in thinking that dns leaks are still not possible whilst using the custom version?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes correct.</p>
<p>Thanks for testing. I think your results rule out my custom settings as the cause for the slowdown. There must be a difference in the base package versions between Whonix and Debian 8.2. (I assume you run both completely updated?) Debian 8.6 came out a few days ago BTW.</p>
<p>With that said I am still interested in finding the cause in Whonix for these differences as it would be a disappointment if server admins are pushed away because of performance problems.</p>

            <p>OK it does diverge a lot but since Whonix 13 released I have changed the settings file considerably and ripped out a lot of useless features to lessen surface of attack. Please try changing the 8.2 settings to match this and tell me about performance:</p>

            <p>Are you running the exact same package versions in scenarios a vs b?</p>
<p>What VM settings do you have for the Debian VM? Did you import the Whonix-workstation-custom xml?</p>
<p>Could be a matter of different performance settings. Would help if you post the XML for the 8.2 VM.</p>

            <p>Unrelated advice:</p>
<p>Stay away from mysql because Oracle has not bothered to patch a serious 0day for 4 (!) months.<br>

            <p>What could cause the following and is there anything I could do to speed things up.</p>
<p>Scenario a = Whonix Gateway &gt; Whonix Workstation. I have a website installed on a nginx server, it communicates with a mysql database and the average page loading times are really slow, it’s taking around 40+ seconds from my testing it seems to be the communication between the webapp and the mysql database which is causing the slow loading times.</p>
<p>Scenario b = Whonix Gateway &gt; Debain vm forced to use Whonix Gateway to torifry traffic. The exact same website, server settings and mysql settings. Now my loading times are down to 5-10 seconds a lot faster and manageable for a tor hidden service.</p>
<p>Scenario c = Standalone Debian vm. The exact same website, server settings and mysql settings, the page load times are almost instant.</p>
<p>I have no problem with the Scenario b loading times, I just want to get Scenario a down to the same loading times. In scenario b the custom debain vm is still been forced to use the Whonix Gateway so I really don’t know why the workstation in scenario a is so much slower to load my pages. I really wanted to use both Whonix Gateway and Whonix Workstation to run a hidden service but I feel those loading times will drive people away</p>
<p>In all 3 scenarios the vm are using the same amount of ram.</p>
<p>Is there a reason for this? Is there a possible way to fix it? Finally would an upgrade to a SSD fix scenario a? I don’t want to pay the upgrade fee if it would have no bearing on the loading times.</p>
