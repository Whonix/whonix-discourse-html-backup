    <description>Good day,

So recently, two things happened which are somewhat connected with competitors to riseup&#39;s mail service:

1.) Protonmail made their site accessible via a Hidden Service _**WITH**_ SSL: https://protonmail.com/tor

This should make the encryption between their servers and a browser accessing them more secure overall, especially keeping in mind that their open-source encryption solution for the mailbox very much relies on a secure connection between the two.

2.) In even better news:

**_Lavabit is back_**: https://lavabit.com

Yes, the only service with enough integrity to publicly decline a NSL has returned and appears to be better than ever. They have a new more secure implementation of encryption called DIME which is Open Source and can be used by anyone who&#39;d be willing to set-up their own service, like what Protonmail did previously.

However, even better, it is apparently capable of encrypting any metadata and allows users to choose how much trust they&#39;d like to put in their servers.

Their &quot;Trusful mode&quot; is similar to how Lavabit operated in the past, using TLS keys on their servers. Though now, they claim these are stored in a &quot;hardware security module&quot; which isn&#39;t accessible by them, though this sentence worries me a bit since it is hard to prove:

&gt; The only account capable of extracting the key is the HSM supervisor. To prevent this we set the passphrase blindly thus locking us out.

The second mode, &quot;Cautious Mode&quot; works similar to Protonmail, though seemingly outside of browsers as well. Just like with PM, only an encrypted key is saved on their servers, which has to be decrypted on access by the user. This means that the user doesn&#39;t have to trust their servers and gets true end-to-end encryption.

The third, &quot;Paranoid Mode&quot; does never get any key, encrypted or otherwise.

For me the dilemma now is the following:

Should I stick with Protonmail, which are in Switzerland, but do not give me the option of storing my private key to access my encrypted messages only on my system.

Or, should I switch to Lavabit, which give me the ability to use &quot;Paranoid Mode&quot; to keep my key to myself, thus trusting no one with it, while relying on servers in the US of A.

The problem is that while both are Open Source, I can&#39;t tell whether that source code is also used by them in the way they claim it is. Adding to that, while Ladar Levison showed, that he would rather stop than cave in under a NSL, nothing says that future laws or more cleverly drafted NSL&#39;s couldn&#39;t force him to do it anyways.

Adding to that, Ladar was somewhat willing to cooperate with US authorities: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/09/lavabit-metadata-log-3500-offer

Have a nice day,

Ego

            <p>As I read in Whonix Wiki, the only really important question about using e-mail anonymously is the question if registration over Tor possible. Every e-mail provider reads your mails so the question is about anonymity not privacy. If you don’t share your personal information about your real identity and use an anonymous e-mail account only over Tor, then it is ‘pseudonymous’ because pure anonymity doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>That’s great, but unfortunately, mail from unpopular e-mail providers can be easily blocked by big services like Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo etc. because of ‘spam’ so it is a risk that your mail will never be recieved by these providers. Also many popular  social networks block sending their verification messages to unpopular and ‘fraud’ e-mail mailboxes such as Protonmail, Tutanota, Lavabit etc.</p>
<p>So, the best variant is to use both popular and Tor-friendly e-mail provider.</p>

            <p>Google Scripts: We have google scripts at signup and login to prevent account abuse. We are looking for any other solution for this and we will happily replace it with something equal.  The alternatives are cell phone confirmation which is anti-privacy, email confirmation which is silly for an email site, and asking for a donation for a free account which is evil.  So to prevent account abuse we are stuck with using google recaptcha in those two places.  It’s not ideal but we are searching for alternatives and we’ll make the correction as soon as we can.  I would sincerely like to know peoples thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Non-JS to signup: I have always felt like using javascripts is like putting 3 ounces of sh*t in a birthday cake. It doesn’t matter if it’s a small amount, no one will eat it:) Lame joke.  Our front end is built using Angular (Javascripts) because it is what does the encryption and decryption.  We have added checksums so users can confirm that the code they receive is the same code that we show in github.  Right now other E2E email services offer a “You can trust us not to screw you” security model.  They show code in github but serve it from a private responsitiy and ask you to trust them that it wont have malcious code.  We are trying to take a step in the right direction with checksums but we realize it’s a small step.  Regardless we are working on a way to use our email without javascripts but it will take some time.</p>
<p>Whats more serious than Google Scripts are the Paypal and Stripe scripts.  They are able to see into users inbox’s more than google scripts.  We’re going to write a post about that in the near future.  If users use the free account or pay with bitcoin/monero they can protect themselves from evil paypal/stripe scripts.</p>

<p>Can you please strip out any Google scripts and allow non-JS to signup? These are two areas that would put you on par with the competition.</p>

<p>Haven’t heard that much from the Tor/Whonix community on the last one (<em>cloudflare-ends-captcha-challenges</em>) so i guess it will be a - wait and see how it goes. Since Tor Project tweaked their binaries for this (or so it <em>states</em>??) I would imagine they will be commenting on this eventually. If they haven’t already?</p>

            <p>Hey I’m here from CTemplar.</p>
<p>We will soon post an article about how to setup a very secure email environment directing users to Whonix’s email page.  We are not affiliates however it is best to be honest with people and direct people them to the content they need.</p>
<p>Can you explain how cloudflare prevents Tor users from soling the recaptcha?</p>
<p>Currently we are not that unique.  All we offer users is sincerity and hard work.  We respectfully ask the community about what we can improve on.   Then please allow us the opportunity to work hard to prove that we are sincere.</p>

<p>Well both points are true. Protonmail did in fact announce CRV stake ownership. CRV is an investment company and not a charity. No doubt they gave them 2 million dollars for something in return.</p>
<p>Yes Protonmail’s security claims are snake oil. Their barriers for anonymous registration and letting users make use of their own keys are problems I’ve confronted them about it on twitter. The situation has not changed since. This blog post confirms that no E2E encryption is available for protonmail and that their JS implementation can be circumvented at will, which is true:</p>

            <p>since we already noted that these services are not trustable just use them for registration then adding lavabit as well will not be a problem.</p>
<p>Edit:- lavabit doesnt contain “free signup” , all their services user need to pay in order to have an account, so its not recommended to put it as suggestion for the new users who want to have an email in order to communicate with us.</p>

<p>Sure i wouldn’t trust a non technical secure service either.<br>
I think the Incentive to behave honestly and not screw up (like Riseup) is much higher if you’re getting paid from your Users , then some freebee service like Riseup who just lies and bows down once their own Freedom is threatened.</p>

<p>Why is something not anonymous if you have to pay for it ? You could use offline bought bitcoin… I would rather trust a company with a service i pay for to do what they promise then some free service to keep their word.</p>

</aside>
<p>You will be part of a very small anonymity set. Paying for anything already keeps many potential users away and the number of them smart enough to do it anonymously is less.</p>
<p>I would not trust anything that is not technically secure. Lavabit was liable last time because their encryption system was still under the server admin’s control. He behaved honestly but how many people are willing to risk their business and freedom to do that?</p>
<p>Also DIME is a good start but nothing beats timing and traffic obfuscation at the network layer.</p>

Obviously a Setup like I2P Bote or Bitmessage would be best but that’s another Topic.</p>

            <p>FTR Lavabit is not a free service and therefore not anonymous either.</p>
