    <title>Whonixcheck on custom workstation</title>

    <description>Hello. I have built a custom Ubuntu-based workstation and was able to install all the required components from the Whonix repository. Everything appears to work as expected, except that whonixcheck complains that it cannot find the Whonix Build Version file (duh).

[code][ERROR] [whonixcheck] Whonix News Download Result: Whonix Build Could not read Whonix Build Version File. (Code: 1) Please report this bug! is outdated! Sorry, automatically updating this Whonix version is not possible. You have to manually download a new Whonix image.[/code]

Is there a way to tell whonixcheck to skip this test since it does not apply to this install?

Otherwise the whonix script look to be quite compatible with current Ubuntu except for torsocks which had to be downgraded. Using the version packaged in the Ubuntu 14.04 repositories causes libtorsocks error messages to appear in the terminal for internet related commands.

Keep up the great work!</description>

            <p>I looked around a bit and I found the easy built-in way to disable the individual components of whonixcheck.</p>
<p>In <span class="bbcode-b">/etc/whonix.d/30_whonixcheck_default</span> I uncommented the line</p>

<p>and now whonixcheck isn’t complaining anymore.</p>

<p>As for using the Whonix components in Ubuntu, all that was required as of version 14.04 was to add the whonix and torproject repositories to the apt sources and all the dependencies were met.  I’m still testing to see if something maybe missing under the hood.</p>

            <p>Using whonixcheck outside of Whonix is currently a bit difficult unless you can fix a few glitches. Currently not supported. In near future there will be a repository <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck">https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck</a> where you can build a deb package as I am in process of splitting Whonix into multiple packages (<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/40">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/issues/40</a>). I don’t know what changes are required to make it run in a custom debian/ubuntu, haven’t looked into that yet. Mostly simple stuff I am planing to do later. Maybe try this.</p>
<p>In file 50_check-whonix-news in function check_whonix_build_news comment out check_whonix_build_news.</p>
<p>In file 10_preparation it says.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Try setting to.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Also.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>As for torsocks, I don’t recommend downgrade. There is a patch to fix this bug. I am wondering Ubuntu still hasn’t applied it.</p>
