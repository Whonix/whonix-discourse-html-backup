    <title>Is that possible with Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/is-that-possible-with-whonix/6966</link>
    <description>Hi, I would like to deal with Whonix. Currently I have no experience with it.

But before I deal intensively with Wohnix, I would like to know in advance whether the following is possible:

By default:
User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Internet

This setting should work if none of the following settings are assigned to the VM:

And as an option:
User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (A)&gt; Internet (for VM1 &amp; VM3)
User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (B)&gt; Internet (for VM2)
User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (C)&gt; Internet (for dem0)
User&gt; TOR&gt; Internet (for VM4)
User&gt; Directly to the Intenet (for VM5)
User&gt; Socks5&gt; Internet (D) (for VM6)
User&gt; VPN&gt; Internet (for VM7)

If I create now, for example, a new VM first accesses the default setting (User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Internet), unless I assign it to one of the settings.

--------------------------

Another question:

Can I also assign a special second rule for applications with Whonix? For example:

Main rule:
User&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (A)&gt; Internet (for VM1 &amp; VM3)
Second rule
VM1&gt; Software A&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (B)&gt; Internet
VM1&gt; Software B&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (C)&gt; Internet
VM1&gt; Software C&gt; TOR&gt; VPN&gt; Socks5 (C)&gt; Internet
VM1&gt; Software D&gt; Internet
VM1&gt; Software E&gt; VPN&gt; Internet


I do not need any step-by-step instructions first. Would only like to know if it is possible in principle. If possible, maybe a few keywords for which I could research.

Then I try to find out on my own. If I get stuck, I can still ask you for help.



I hope my english is understandable, otherwise Google Translate is to blame :-)</description>

            <p>Whonix only goes through Tor. You can add VPN / Proxies before or after Tor. Not as simple on/off switches but very doable. If you want clearnet this can of course be done in a separate VM but that will have nothing to do with Whonix.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>Mega</code></p>
<p>I’m not sure I fully understand what you are asking. Some of your questions are Qubes specific (do not involve Whonix). Others are Qubes-Whonix specific. But to be <strong>clear</strong> you should not use clearnet and Tor at the same time.</p>

<p>You’re asking if it is possible to combine tunnels with Whonix. The anwser is yes. I can’t really comment any more than this because I don’t fully understand what you are asking. Many of the examples don’t  include Whonix  which could lead to misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Please read the Whonix tunnel documentation. If you have any more questions please feel free to ask.  Keep in mind that arbitrarily adding tunnel-links does not necessarily increase security/anonymity. On the contrary, it can do the opposite.</p>
<p>I could provide keywords that you can use to find some answers or i can provide a single link where you can find most (if not all?) of your answers.</p>
