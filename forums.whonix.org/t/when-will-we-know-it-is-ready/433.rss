    <description>I am prepared to jump off of the virtualbox ship as soon as possible in favor of KVM.

How we will know whonix is fully ready to run in KVM? Did that already happen and I just missed it?

Thank you for all your hard work. The whonix developers are saving lives.</description>

            <p>Hi thank you for your interest. For all intents and purposes, its ready. The next test release of version 9 should be coming very soon - Patrick will announce it within a few days. The KVM configuration files should be static by this point. Detailed instructions have been posted <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM" data-bbcode="true">here</a>. If you have any further questions or need assistance let me know.</p>
