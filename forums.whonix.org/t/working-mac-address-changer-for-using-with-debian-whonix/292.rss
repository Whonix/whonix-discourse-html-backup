    <title>Working MAC-address changer for using with Debian/Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/working-mac-address-changer-for-using-with-debian-whonix/292</link>
    <description>The MAC changers that have always been shipped with most Linux distro&#39;s, often did not work well on some Wlan adapters. But Tails now has a working MAC-address changer that works well. Is there a similar working MAC spoofing application for Debian (using Whonix TwoVM or Physical Isolation).</description>

            <p>Don’t get me wrong. It seems to me, that the Tails devs have done what is within their abilities (which is more than I could come up with!), but that their macchanger is still too fragile and entangled into Tails and GDM, coming with many limitations. Just read their fine design document:<br>
<a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/</a> And you’ll see what limitations I am talking about.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, not. No one has ported the Tails specific macchanger to general Linux yet and to my knowledge, no one is working on it. Help welcome!</p>
