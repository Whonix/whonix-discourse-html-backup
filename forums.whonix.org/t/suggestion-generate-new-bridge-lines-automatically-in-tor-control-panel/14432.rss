    <title>Suggestion: generate new bridge lines automatically in tor-control-panel</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/suggestion-generate-new-bridge-lines-automatically-in-tor-control-panel/14432</link>
    <description>Hi. Tor is blocked in my area so I need to use bridges. Bridge nodes are very unstable so they can suddenly turn off. Generally, there are two ways to configure bridge lines:

1. obfs4 (recommended) - this option automatically adds generated obfs4 bridge lines to torrc file and then starts bootstrapping process
2. Manually add bridge lines - very inconvenient. Need to visit Tor Project site every time and solve captcha in order to get new bridge lines.

But the problem is when I select `obfs4 (recommended)` in `Configure` menu in `tor-control-panel`, bridge lines are often remain the same. I&#39;d like to always have a newly generated bridge lines every time I press `obfs4 (recommended)`. Is it possible to implement this?</description>
