    <title>Question regarding software installation, best practices</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/question-regarding-software-installation-best-practices/4912</link>
    <description>I have read the wiki about installing from PPAs and such, but what is the best practice in the following situations:


NextCloud Client (for example), has a pre-built binary to download, a PPA, and a github repo, and an AppImage.

Should I download binary, check signatures (if available), and manually update/upgrade? 

Should I add the PPA repo, and update with dist-upgrade? (while having to trust that repo maintainer)

Should I check the sig on the AppImage and run that? (Not sure if there is an update mechanism here, but might cause system bloat if AppImage contains packages that I would normally need installed for other apps anyway. Leading to multiple instances)

Or should I build from git hub, and try to remember to &#39;git pull&#39; as often as possible?


And, for when github is the only feasible option, what is the recommended place to build the binaries? I have been issuing &#39;sudo git clone&#39; from /opt, but this often leads to permission problems because I am building as root, and then running as user. Often the binary will run, but will crash unexpectedly when a permission issue arises. 

For instance, electrum bitcoin wallet (ver 3.1 on GitHub) crashes uneexpectedly when run as user, but has no problem as root.

Should I be building in ~/ ?

What is the standard practice for git cloning?</description>
