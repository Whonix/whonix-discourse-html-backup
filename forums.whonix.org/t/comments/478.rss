    <description>Even though comments are not preserved... What do you think about commenting all non-obvious settings?

For example https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,489.msg3757.html#msg3757 is not obvious to the reader.

For example. Currently:

[code]&lt;filetransfer enable=&#39;no&#39;/&gt;?[/code]

Suggestion.

[code]
&lt;!-- Disable drag and drop by SPICE, so users cannot accidentally copy from guest to host and vice versa. It is recommended to use shared folders in documentation. --&gt;
&lt;filetransfer enable=&#39;no&#39;/&gt;?
[/code]

These comments should ideally be useful to all kinds of audience. Developers such as you and me, so we still remember in a years time why we set which setting, for auditors who are wondering why the fu.. we did that and users who are wondering &#39;well, couldn&#39;t I set &quot;&lt;filetransfer enable=&#39;yes&#39;/&gt;&quot;, what are the risks, would that be okay for me&quot;.

Disadvantage is, we would have to mirror all those comments in all xml files, which could be kinda annoying and cumbersome?

Alternatively we could just use https://www.whonix.org/forum/index.php/topic,462.0.html to add one comment, that links to some wiki page, that explains the whole reasoning behind the settings we are using. What do you think?</description>

            <p>What message do you want to be in there? Once you write something I’ll add it. Do you think I should include my nym with your name in the copyleft notice?</p>

            <p>I think a one liner comment like you suggested to warn people not change anything without reading the implications on the wiki is a fine idea idea. The approach we have taken so far is to put these notes on the KVM wiki page.</p>
<p>This referral comment can actually be written is a way to be preserved using the metadata tags I posted on dev/KVM. It will show up in the gui in the vm description pane. We could add a copyleft notice there too if you like.</p>
<p>Over time this is the best maintainable solution as updating settings and comments won’t involve mirroring them to six different files and will keep the configuration files nice and lean.</p>
