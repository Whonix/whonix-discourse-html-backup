    <title>Attempting physical isolation with Rasberry Pi 4</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/attempting-physical-isolation-with-rasberry-pi-4/13362</link>
    <description>So far I have installed Debian Bullseye from the image on the raspi debian tested images site
20220121_raspi_4_bullseye.img.xz
2022.01.21 	11 (Bullseye) 	4 	p400

And I have followed the instructions for physical isolation on the whonix site
I did get a few errors at the end of the build which I hit ignore on

Everything seems to be working but I have no idea how to finish the setup ... I would like the workstation to be a windows 7 machine but so far when I ping google for instance from the whonix gateway it resolves the google ip but I get Destination Host Unreachable

I am wondering if the build failed because of the errors or it&#39;s just a matter of fixing the network settings

Any help would be much appreciated</description>
