    <title>Can&#39;t connect to Whonix 15 gateway with Android x86</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/cant-connect-to-whonix-15-gateway-with-android-x86/9125</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to connect Android x86 using Whonix Gateway I followed this : wiki/Other_Operating_Systems#Whonix_.E2.84.A2-Android-Workstation
but eth0 doesn&#39;t exist I tried different network &quot;wlan0&quot; and &quot;wifi_eth&quot; but neither of them got an IP. I managed to get an IP using both and &quot;up&quot; at the end of `ifconfig wlan0 10.152.152.12 netmask 255.255.192.0` but no internet connection after that.

I also tried Android 7.1 and 9 both have the same issue.</description>

            <p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I had the same problem. I don’t really remember the Android version.</p>
<p>The problem ended being Android not being able to set a static IP.</p>
<p>The workaround was to run a DHCP server on Whonix Gateway and let it autoconfigure the Android Workstation with the custom IP address.</p>
