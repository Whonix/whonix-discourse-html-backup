    <title>Post install questions:PGP files, username and pw change</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/post-install-questions-pgp-files-username-and-pw-change/1467</link>
    <description>First of all thank you to Ego for your valuable links and fast answer to my questions.  Again I apologize for how new I am to both Linux and whonix.  I am about to change the default username and pw do I run these commands on both the gateway and workstation or just the gateway?

My next question is I noticed that there is a PGP app on the workstation however how can I import keys that are on files located on the host outside the VM??  In other words if I have keys located on files outside the VM how can I xfer them to VM?

Lastly,  when it comes to installing apps like pidgin OTR can I just run the same commands I did when installing them on Ubuntu??

Again, please forgive how big a noob I am at this, I have tried doing my own research but many of the Linux instructions are meant for people that have at least a basic knowledge of Linux and it&#39;s commands.  Again any help would be appreciated and I imagine it will be some time before you hear an intelligent question from me.


Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>You only need to change the passwords, not the usernames and this needs to be done both on the Workstation and the Gateway, see: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Post_Install_Advice#On_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Post_Install_Advice#On_Whonix-Gateway_and_Whonix-Workstation</a></p>
<p>Regarding your second question, please read this: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer</a></p>
<p>To your third question yes, but keep in mind this needs to be done on the Workstation.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
