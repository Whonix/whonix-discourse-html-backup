    <description>Hello guys, I am somewhat a newer whonix user and things have been quite alright with the exception of the time sync. most times the sync fails and sometimes it affects my access to the net through tor. if the time sync fails, sometimes I can&#39;t even access the web. The error says to report the issue if it keeps happening and well, it does keep happening.... can anybody offer some insight on this issue please? Thank you!</description>

            <p>Hi <code>whonixhelp1</code></p>
<p>Does your host system keep the correct time? If you use pause / suspend / save / resume feature on your virtualizer, it can cause time issues.</p>
