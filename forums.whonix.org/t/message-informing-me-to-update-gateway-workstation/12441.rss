    <title>Message informing me to update Gateway &amp; Workstation</title>

    <description>Hi there

Sorry I am quite new to this and its probably quite basic what needs doing but I am slowly learning.

Followed the guide to install Whonix by following the Whonix KVM Wiki page. In doing so I was able to install Whonix 16.0.2.7. Thats because that is the latest Whonix on the KVM instructions. 

When I first logged into Whonix gateway a system message has told me I should update Whonix Gateway and Workstation.

I noticed there is another newer version or Whonix (16.0.3 something) however this is not linked to the KVM whonix guide.

What shall I do here? Do I need to wait until the new version appears on the KVM whonix wiki page? Should I also be installing Kicksecure for extra anonymity?</description>

<p>Just run <code>sudo apt update</code> then<code> sudo apt-dist-upgrade</code>. Whonix is based on Kicksecure as a base except it is tweaked for anonymity, so no.</p>
