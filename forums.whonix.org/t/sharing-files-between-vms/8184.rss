I wonder about sharing (relatively large) files between VMs when one of the VMs isn&#39;t trusted (say a Windows VM or not trusted for any other reason).

The sharing should only be one way - meaning the untrusted VM doesn&#39;t get write access. I am aware it&#39;s possible to set the shared folder as read-only for this VM, but is there anything else or an alternative way this can be done?

A follow up question, is there a way to use shared folders without a folder on the host? having the second VM compromised is one thing, having the host compromised is another. Looks to me as if a shared folder makes an escape from VM easier.</description>
