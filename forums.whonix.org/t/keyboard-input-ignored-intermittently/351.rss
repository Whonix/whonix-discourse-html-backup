    <title>Keyboard input ignored intermittently</title>

    <description>When I disabled USB, VirtualBox says there are inconsistent settings unless I change the setting under System &gt; Motherboard &gt; Pointing device to PS/2 Mouse. I did that but the keyboard sometimes doesn&#39;t respond and I&#39;m not sure if it is related to this setting. This happens with the default workstation or with Ubuntu and seems to happen in both at once, on and off for a while, then it works fine for a while. I have two keyboards plugged in. I&#39;m using VirtualBox version 4.3.12 on Wheezy. This is rather annoying to say the least!</description>

            <p>I just checked again, Whonix-Workstation 8.2 comes with USB disabled by default. I am referring to:<br>
Right click on VM -&gt; settings -&gt; USB -&gt; unchecked “Enable USB controller”)</p>
<p>So I don’t know where you could have disabled USB?</p>
<p>I just checked again, Whonix-Workstation 8.2 comes with “Enable absolute pointing device” disabled by default. I am referring to:<br>
Right click on VM -&gt; settings -&gt; System -&gt; unchecked “Enable absolute pointing device”</p>
<p>Two keyboards probably is a rare setup. Removing one could fix the issue. If you want to continue to use both, there must be somewhere a bug in Debian, Ubuntu and/or VirtualBox. Probably not caused by anything Whonix does.</p>
<p>If it happens with VirtualBox and Ubuntu VMs, then you get access to the much bigger Ubuntu and VirtualBox support community. I advice contacting them while keeping the extra Whonix layer out of the question to avoid distraction. See also:<br>
