    <description>Reading over there website it seems they have implemented end to end encryption. They also claim to have handed over 0 user data to 3rd parties. They also have moved locations to avoid regulations. 

Why isn&#39;t this mentioned as a viable option more often? Is there any critical security flaw I am not seeing here? It has also been audited, as compared to qtox which is provided by default in whonix 15, which is experimental software, ie could have critical vulnerabilities</description>
