    <title>How to Increase Frequency of Tor Bootstrap Test?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-increase-frequency-of-tor-bootstrap-test/1654</link>
    <description>Is there was way to make the Tor bootstrap test run more often than the default settings?

Am I correct after a successful test at startup, if there are issues later with Tor bootstrap, all Tor Browser activity will fail, so perhaps there&#39;s no need for more tests after the test at startup? 

What type of error message will the user receive if a Tor bootstrap failure occurs during Tor Browser activity?</description>

<p>How often whonixcheck runs is currently hardcoded in<br>
<code>/usr/lib/whonixcheckdaemon</code>.</p>
<p>Two times it uses:<br>
sleep 3600 &amp;</p>
<p>(In seconds.)</p>
<p>You could change it to something else, but then whole whonixcheck<br>
would run more often.</p>
<p>You could also set up a script to run</p>
<p>whonixcheck --function check_tor_bootstrap</p>
<p>as often as you see fit.</p>
<p>You could even set up custom notifications. Use this “API” style etc.</p>
<p>Have a look at:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_tor_bootstrap" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://github.com/Whonix/whonixcheck/blob/master/usr/lib/whonixcheck/check_tor_bootstrap</a></p>
<p>The check_tor_bootstrap script is a user of:<br>
/usr/lib/anon-shared-helper-scripts/tor_bootstrap_check.bsh</p>
<pre><code>source /usr/lib/anon-shared-helper-scripts/tor_bootstrap_check.bsh
check_tor_bootstrap_helper
</code></pre>
<p>That it essentially. Then you have access to variable<br>
<code>$tor_bootstrap_percent</code>. If it’s <code>100</code>, then bootstrap is 100% and<br>
perfectly fine. Otherwise, something else.</p>

fail, so perhaps there’s no need for more tests after the test at<br>
startup?</p>

<p>Yes. You would figure out pretty easy that Tor is not bootstrapped,<br>
because no more internet connections would be possible from the<br>
workstation [or gateway].</p>

bootstrap failure occurs during Tor Browser activity?</p>

<p>Stop Tor or shut down Whonix-Gateway to find out.</p>
