    <title>Defining &quot;update&quot; and &quot;upgrade&quot; for Whonix wiki.</title>

    <description>New definitions for `update` and `upgrade` are needed for the Whonix wiki.

When users are instructed to update their systems, this is the reason they are given.

[![Ambox warning pn.svg.png\ 40x35](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/w/images/thumb/f/f7/Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png/40px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png)](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/w/index.php?title=File:Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png&amp;amp;filetimestamp=20130717200816&amp;amp;) **All packages must stay up-to-date for security purposes.**

**1. Update the Package Lists**

Check package lists on at least a daily basis and keep the host operating system updated

[https://whonix.org//wiki/Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates](https://whonix.org//wiki/Operating_System_Software_and_Updates#Updates)


With the current documentation it _might_ not be clear to some users:
* What happens when I `update`?
   *  What does it actually mean when I &quot;_Check the package lists&quot;_?
   * What am I downloading onto my system if anything? 
* What happens when I `upgrade`?
   * Are these newer versions of the same package or completely new packages.
   * Do these packages include security updates?
* What is the difference between `update` and `upgrade`

While the answer to these question might be easy for some users. It may not be for others. These questions were asked on other forums and a large majority of those threads ended with someone posting this:

From the debian man pages

&gt; **update**
&gt; 
&gt; update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in /etc/apt/sources.list. For example, when using a Debian archive, this command retrieves and scans the Packages.gz files, so that information about new and updated packages is available. An update should always be performed before an upgrade or dist-upgrade. Please be aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance.

&gt; **dist-upgrade**
&gt; 
&gt; dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; **apt-get** has a &quot;smart&quot; conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also [apt_preferences(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt_preferences.5.en.html) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages.


[https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt-get.8.en.html](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/apt-get.8.en.html)

Then  everyone agrees that those are the correct definitions and the thread is marked as solved. But I wonder how many of those  people actually understand what is written in those two man pages? I would guess not everyone.

The task at hand is to come up with better definitions. So lets try for:
* Keeping these definitions short ( if possible )
* Using synonyms. Same meaning but easier to understand?
* Technically correct
* Easy for less experienced users to understand
* Anything else??



This is what I have. Can this be improved or do you have a different idea for definitions?

**Update**:

 Updates the system packages list with information on new and updated packages that are currently available for download.

**Upgrade:** (`dist-upgrade`)

Installs the newest versions of the current packages installed on the system.  

**Upgrade:** (`upgrade`)?

Should this be defined? Users also ask what the difference between `dist-upgrade` and  `upgrade`.

**Note:** Moderators feel free to edit this post.</description>

<p>This fit since Whonix is now a rolling release.</p>
<p>I’ll go ahead and add the definitions to the wiki unless there are any objections:</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> :</p>
<p>Updates the system packages list with information on new and updated packages that are currently available for download.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade:</strong> ( <code>dist-upgrade</code> )</p>

<p>By the way Ubuntu has a <code>do-release-upgrade</code> tool.</p>
