    <title>Whonix lagging when opening a new tab, clicking links, etc. in Tor.</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-lagging-when-opening-a-new-tab-clicking-links-etc-in-tor/14101</link>
    <description>The title sums my issue up pretty well, whenever I open a tab in Tor, click a link, or open a bookmark the whole operating system locks up for 10-20 seconds. It&#39;s practically unusable at this point. I have no issue running Tor on my host OS.

Whonix workstation has 8 GB of RAM allocated to it, other than that I have not changed any of the default settings, the gateway has 2 GB of RAM as well. My host machine is very capable.

If anyone has had this issue or has a possible solution it would help me out a lot if you could share it with me, thank you!</description>
