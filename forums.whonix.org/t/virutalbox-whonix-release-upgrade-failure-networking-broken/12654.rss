    <description>I followed these instructions exactly on my gateway, it finished with an error, sorry i cant post it verbatim because i cant copy it to my workstation and i cant post from the gateway, it said &quot;error processing package grub-pc&quot;. I rebooted and the the padlock sync icon in the upper right no longer appears and workstation wont connect to internet. I tried sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade and it gives this huge list over 200 items of things, i select to upgrade, it finishes with same grub error. I reboot, no tor still, i try upgrade again, same huge list of things, same error. I copied over from my backup since this release is broken and i dont want to try it on my workstation. 

EDIT: There were a couple things i might have answered wrong, during the update process it asks if i want to keep the same keymap, i selected yes, then later it asked if i want to keep the sources i have or the updated one from the maintainer, i selected to keep the same ones, i dont know what this means and it was never written in the instructions how to answer this.

# Release Upgrade

* Backup all data - ideally have a clone of the VM(s) so it is possible to try again (if necessary).
* Perform the usual [standard (&quot;everyday&quot;) update instructions]
* Consider running the optional [sanity tests]
* Run [systemcheck]
* View `release-upgrade` command version.

cat /usr/sbin/release-upgrade | grep version=

* Check `release-upgrade` command version. Should be minimum `1.5`, should show `version=&quot;1.5&quot;`.
* Consider keeping the full release upgrade log output. It will be required for [Support] in case there are issues.
* Perform the automated [release upgrade using `release-upgrade` command.

sudo release-upgrade

* Done. If everything went well, at the end it will show:
&gt; INFO: OK. (release-upgrade version: 1.5) Release upgrade success.

* Reboot.</description>

<p>No.</p>
<p><code>release-upgrade</code> internally uses <code>apt-get-noninteractive</code>. If you’re using apt / apt-get manually- then it’s interactive and asking complicated questions.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is the terminal output shown during release-upgrade. If you didn’t store it and closed the window already then it’s gone now.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a clone or snapshot chances to receive free help to repair it are minimal. Fixing a broken APT state is hard, even harder once Tor connectivity is broken. Hard means needing a lot time, meaning expensive.</p>
