    <description>i donno if anyone happened to feel this but im experiencing differences of tor browser inside the 3 operating systems

1- the speed of tor browser inside whonix is faster than tor browser inside windows, is there any reason behind that ?

2- i can play youtube or most of html5 videos inside tail (without installing anythting) while in whonix i cant make youtube to work or any html5 video; is there a reason behind this? like security or anonymity reasons ..etc or its just me whos having these issues ?

(i know whonix doesnt has his own touch on tor but i donno how can i explain these differences)</description>

            <p>Can you try please if vimeo works using the Tor Browser Bundle on a Debian jessie host?<br>
Probably will not?<br>
In that case, it’s an extra feature of Tails perhaps.<br>
Or phrased another way, a missing feature in Tor Browser.<br>
Could you look please, if this issue has been posted on the Tor Browser tracker by The Tor Project?</p>

<p>tail -&gt; Tails. This is important. Because “tail” is a standard command line utility so writing “tail” will side track your question and cause confusion.</p>
<p>That’s up to the Tails support. -&gt; <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">https://tails.boum.org/</a></p>

            <p>i figured out why the youtube inside Whonix was not working because it was forbidden from working by noscript , so when i disabled the no script youtube worked.</p>
<p>the problem that this case is not similar for the other websites for example like vimeo, here is a pic showing that vimeo is working inside Tails but not inside Whonix:-</p>

<blockquote>So it sounds like Whonix is fine (fast) and Tails is slow. Seems to be eligible to contact the Tails support if you care about this getting fixed.</blockquote>
<p>yeah so true, browsing the tor browser inside whonix is way faster than tor browser inside tail or tor browser alone (inside windows). how can i report this test ? i mean how can i prove or show them that tor inside whonix is faster than the others ? is there commands or websites or …etc ? or i should film that as short video ?</p>
