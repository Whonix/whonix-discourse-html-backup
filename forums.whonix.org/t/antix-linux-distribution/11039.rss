    <title>antiX Linux Distribution</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/antix-linux-distribution/11039</link>
    <description>I have been using and testing Antix heavily for a little over a year now.

For the past couple weeks I have been working on starting with Antix core and incorporating the Kicksecure/Whonix packages.

I am loving the results.  The minimum use of resources and the added security is a very nice combination.

I would like to add custom icons / backsplashes / theme for Kicksecure/Whonix before releasing an ISO for testing.

I lack in the area of creative design so to speak, so if anyone would like to help in that area, it would be greatly appreciated.

Anyone interested?</description>

            <p>Kicksecure security hardened.     That works.</p>
<p>Btw, Antix isn’t my creation…   its a lightweight distro from  antixlinux .com</p>
<p>I just happen to love the speed and lack of resources it uses.</p>
<p>Going forward ill be sure to use correct reference.</p>
<p>I’ll take a look at  whats done so far on that install script and see if I can lend a hand.</p>
<p>Would be a pleasure.</p>

<p>for a small and fast Kicksecure distro.</p>

</aside>
<p>Please don’t call it <code>Kicksecure distro</code>. The name <code>Kicksecure</code> is reserved to software officially released on the upcoming <code>kicksecure.com</code> domain. [1] Especially if it is being redistributed to third parties such as the public. This is for trademark reasons.</p>
<p>Alternative wording examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>based on Kicksecure</li>
<li>fork of Kicksecure</li>
<li>software fork of Kicksecure</li>
<li>derivative of Kicksecure</li>
<li>Kicksecure derivative</li>
<li>includes software by Kicksecure</li>
<li>Kicksecure based</li>
<li>Kicksecure security hardened</li>
</ul>
<p>If you create a deidcated homepage <code>wciso.holt-technology.com</code> for antiX Linux distribution you can mention “includes software by Kicksecure” but this is fully optional. (<code>ubuntu.com</code> also doesn’t need to say “comes with GNU GRUB”.)</p>
<p>There will be a Kicksecure ISO released on <code>kicksecure.com</code> at some point.</p>
<p>We already got most of the code ready due to the development of <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host</a> where <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/onion_knight">@onion_knight</a> contributed the code for ISO creation. The ISO comes even with a calamares based installer. I don’t think it will be hard to re-use that code to generate the Kicksecure ISO. Probably requires just some adjustments to Whonix build script.</p>
<p>The first steps towards an official Kicksecure ISO would be would be adding this feature to “Whonix build script”. Help welcome! Then also <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix">Whonix/Whonix</a> (the build script) should either be renamed to something more generic or forked. I am not sure yet. Would be weird in the final result to tell people “use Whonix build script to build the Kicksecure ISO”. Should become a fully independent project without much reference to Whonix to avoid conflating, confusing things.</p>
<p>Also due to the usual Open Source development conventions it cannot be a binary-only release. Needs to be created using a build script so anyone can rebuild it from source code without any binaries created by Kicksecure.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] And from <code>whonix.org</code> until <code>kicksecure.com</code> gets published.</p>

<p>Very glad to learn that software by Whonix / Kicksecure is useful for others and being included in derivatives!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have an iso uploaded to one of my websites currently.   A permanent home/project page will be setup soon for it.</p>
<p>I started with latest Antix ISO – the 19.3 runit net amd64 distro, which is based on Debian Buster.   Then added much of Kicksecure to it while utilizing as little of Antix packages as possible.</p>
<p>The kernel that is installed is the latest from Liqourix for the Buster build. This helped to increase operational speed.</p>
<p>The goal by doing this is to visually be able to plot the least amount of files needed in addition to the Whonix/Kicksecure files, for a small and fast Kicksecure distro.</p>
<p>Whomever downloads to test it out, should have no issues with enabling and using wifi.</p>
<p>Currently, the list below is everything that is installed so far.</p>
<p>Kloak<br>
sdwdate<br>
vanguards<br>
security-misc<br>
Tirdad/Tirdad Dkms<br>
anon-apps-config<br>
sandbox-app-launcher<br>
gpg-bash-lib<br>
hardened-malloc<br>
hardoned-malloc-kicksecure-enable<br>
onion-grater<br>
swap-file-creator<br>
torbrowser<br>
tor-control-panel<br>
open-link-confirmation<br>
anon-icon-pack<br>
apparmor<br>
dh-apparmor<br>
apparmor-utils<br>
apparmor-notify<br>
apparmor-easyprof<br>
apparmor-profile-torbrowser<br>
grub-enable-apparmor</p>
<p>Seems like there are a few more I forgot to take note of.  Lkrg is not installed yet. I am working on figuring out why its having issues installing.</p>
<p>Opera web browser is installed.</p>
<p>Give it a run and drop some feedback and or suggestions.</p>
<p>It is very easy to customize and remaster.  Easy to create other iso’s from.  Seems to be pretty quick running as live usb.</p>
<p>it can be downloaded from https:    wciso . holt-technology . com</p>
<p>Currently filesize is 797 mb.   Will be working on bringing that size down a bit more.</p>
<p>I personally will be using this as my daily os for everything while making adjustments.  It so far seems to be stable enough for that.</p>
