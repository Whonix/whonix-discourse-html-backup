    <title>Key Import.. key fingerprint doesnt match..</title>

    <description>Heyllo everybody :grin:

I am having some trouble with KGpg Assistant. I think. When I imported the patrick.asc with KGpg it did not match the [screenshot](https://www.whonix.org/w/images/5/5e/Kgpg_key_imported_new.png) found on the tutorial page. Instead I was met with (in short): 

&gt; 1 key processed
&gt; One key imported
&gt; 8D6606[...]DA  Partick Schleizer `&lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;`

So it is a major difference compared to the one on screenshot:

&gt; 9C131A[...]EF Partick Schleizer `&lt;proper@secure mail.biz&gt;`

I know that the email address is different but my concern is the, I guess, fingerprint. 

However, under Details GNUPG says

&gt; [GNUPG]: KEY_CONSIDERED
&gt; 916B8D99[...]CCDA 0
&gt; `[GNUPG]`: KEY_CONSIDERED IMPORTED  8D6606[...]DA  Partick Schleizer `&lt;adrelanos@riseup.net&gt;`
&gt;` [GNUPG]`:  IMPORT_OK 1
&gt; 916B8D99[...]CCDA

I am real new to all this so if anyone could explain and tell me straight away not to trust this one Id really appreciate it. 

Also, I might have been too quick with downloading all the signatures and checksums before this step. :thinking:

OK, and now I just realized I have the same key as they point out in the Whonix Signing Key page, under Web of Trust. The gpg --check-sigs one. I know it said it was for Advanced users but yeah. What is still concerning is the part that did not match up when I imported the patrick.asc with KGpg. 

Perhaps that is nothing to be bothered with?

Anyways. Gracias if anyone could guide me through what is wrong and what I am supposed to do.  That would be great, thanks.</description>

            <p>Hi <code>lol</code></p>
<p>Those screenshots are a little outdated. The fingerprint in the Whonix singing key wiki is correct. Nothing to be concerned about as long as everything matches up to that page. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
