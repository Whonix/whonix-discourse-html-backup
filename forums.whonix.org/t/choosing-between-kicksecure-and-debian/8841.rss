    <description>What is better to use Kicksecure or Debian and then harden Debian using Whonix Docs?
Kicksecure is non-anonymous distribution and in case ISP can fingerprint you that you use Kicksecure, they can tell in 99% number of cases that you are using Whonix too.  But if you use hardened Debian ISP will see that you use Debian, but Debian is used by a lot of people and if you use Whonix VM in Debian host. ISP can&#39;t say if you use Whonix, they just see that you use Tor.
How easy is for them to fingerprint you and see what OS you use ?</description>

<p>seems u didn’t understand my question<br>
Even with two different dedicated devices one for ISP 1 other for isp2 there will be leaks due to windows fingerprinting , VPNs, hardened systems<br>
that why whonix recommends using far distant public wifi</p>

I watched some YouTube videos about active and passive windows fingerprinting.<br>
Also Nmap is a powerful tool , it can leaks everything easily  whether the targeted host is running windows or Linux.</p>
<p>Can Debian alongside kicksecure  be used  to separate identities to connect to open wifi at nearest location</p>

<p>Nothing. It’s a lost cause. There’s no research, little researcher interest, let alone defenses.</p>
<p>Adversaries have an easier task. One fingerprintable mess up and you lost. Even in theory if there were defenses, you wouldn’t know of these are efficient.</p>

            <p>As a pure choice, between Kicksecure and Debian, it comes down to what you, as the user, want from your system.<br>
If you want a relatively secure system but like implementing hardening solutions on your own, choose Debian.<br>
If you want a system that is security-hardened out of the box, choose Kicksecure. Kicksecure is Debian-based, so you do not lose anything that “regular” Debian can do. You can still do everything that Debian can do, but you have the bonus of a pre-hardened system. In effect, you have an operating system that benefits from all the combined years of development, and research of the Whonix team.<br>
Like Patrick said, fingerprinting is multi-faceted and complex. The larger of a userbase that Kicksecure has, the better. The fingerprinting becomes less and less effective as more users use the same system with the same settings.</p>

            <p>No.</p>
<p>Security vs fingerprinting is a conflicting goal unfortunately. Can’t maximize both at the same time. More secure settings are fingerprintable. Standing out form others.</p>
<p>The only solution would be to make as many people as possible use more secure settings so that nobody stands out anymore.</p>
