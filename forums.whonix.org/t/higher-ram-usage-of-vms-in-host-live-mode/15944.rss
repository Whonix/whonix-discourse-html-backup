    <title>Higher RAM usage of VMs in host live mode</title>

    <description>Hello,
My Problem is, that I am running out of RAM in host live mode so that I can&#39;t even run Gateway and Workstation at the same time and I am getting the error with &quot;No space left on device&quot;.
I have used Whonix in the same setup on the same Computer before about one year ago. Back then I could run Gateway + 3x Workstation at once. It was Debian 11 and Whonix 16 as well.

I would like to understand why this is the case. Does anyone have a clue? I reinstalled all from scrap, so I also might have done a mistake there.


System memory:16GB
Gateway memory: 512MB
Workstation memory: 1,5GB</description>
