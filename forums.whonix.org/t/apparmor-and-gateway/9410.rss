            <p>If you mean some of the apparmor profiles that come pre-installed, then yes, it’s always a good idea. Keep in mind that some are active, like the one for Tor, and others are shipped in “complain mode.” That is a helper mode that AppArmor offers so that you can run the app and then after a session or two, check the logs:<br>
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep “DENIED”<br>
That will give you a stdout printing of all the logged denials. Review them and edit the parent profile as necessary.<br>
If you do not review and edit the profiles in complain mode and instead enforce them outright, it will cause breakage.<br>
Also, you can develop profiles for anything that runs on the Workstation also. Profiles are stored in /etc/apparmor.d</p>
