I installed Tor and obfs4proxy packages on debian based system. I can connect to Tor, but I can&#39;t connect to Tor using bridges

Here is my torrc

    ## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
    ## Last updated 22 September 2015 for Tor 0.2.7.3-alpha.
    ## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
    ##
    ## Lines that begin with &quot;## &quot; try to explain what&#39;s going on. Lines
    ## that begin with just &quot;#&quot; are disabled commands: you can enable them
    ## by removing the &quot;#&quot; symbol.
    ##
    ## See &#39;man tor&#39;, or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
    ## for more options you can use in this file.
    ##
    ## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
    ## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

    ## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don&#39;t
    ## configure one below. Set &quot;SOCKSPort 0&quot; if you plan to run Tor only
    ## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
    SOCKSPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
    #SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

    ## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
    ## First entry that matches wins. If no SOCKSPolicy is set, we accept
    ## all (and only) requests that reach a SOCKSPort. Untrusted users who
    ## can access your SOCKSPort may be able to learn about the connections
    ## you make.
    #SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
    #SOCKSPolicy accept6 FC00::/7
    #SOCKSPolicy reject *

    ## Logs go to stdout at level &quot;notice&quot; unless redirected by something
    ## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
    ## you want.
    ##
    ## We advise using &quot;notice&quot; in most cases, since anything more verbose
    ## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
    ##
    ## Send all messages of level &#39;notice&#39; or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
    #Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
    ## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
    #Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
    ## Use the system log instead of Tor&#39;s logfiles
    #Log notice syslog
    ## To send all messages to stderr:
    #Log debug stderr

    ## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
    ## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
    ## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
    RunAsDaemon 1

    ## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
    ## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
    DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

    ## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
    ## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
    ControlPort 9051
    ## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
    ## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.

    ## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.

    ## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
    #ORPort 9001
    ## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
    ## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
    ## follows.  You&#39;ll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
    ## yourself to make this work.
    #ORPort 443 NoListen
    #ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise

    ## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
    ## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
    #Address noname.example.com

    ## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
    ## outgoing traffic to use.
    # OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5

    ## A handle for your relay, so people don&#39;t have to refer to it by key.
    ## Nicknames must be between 1 and 19 characters inclusive, and must
    ## contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9].
    #Nickname ididnteditheconfig

    ## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
    ## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
    ## be at least 75 kilobytes per second.
    ## Note that units for these config options are bytes (per second), not
    ## bits (per second), and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10,
    ## 2^20, etc.
    #RelayBandwidthRate 100 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
    #RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB (1600Kb)

    ## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
    ## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
    ## not to their sum: setting &quot;40 GB&quot; may allow up to 80 GB total before
    ## hibernating.
    ##
    ## Set a maximum of 40 gigabytes each way per period.
    #AccountingMax 40 GBytes
    ## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
    #AccountingStart day 00:00
    ## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
    ## is per month)
    #AccountingStart month 3 15:00

    ## Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge. This line
    ## can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge is misconfigured or
    ## something else goes wrong. Note that we archive and publish all
    ## descriptors containing these lines and that Google indexes them, so
    ## spammers might also collect them. You may want to obscure the fact that
    ## it&#39;s an email address and/or generate a new address for this purpose.
    #ContactInfo Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;
    ## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
    #ContactInfo 0xFFFFFFFF Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;

    ## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
    ## if you have enough bandwidth.
    #DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections

    #DirPort 80 NoListen
    #DirPort 127.0.0.1:9091 NoAdvertise
    ## Uncomment to return an arbitrary blob of html on your DirPort. Now you

    ## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
    ## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they&#39;re on
    ## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
    ## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit. See
    ## ONLY 5 LINKS ALLOWED FOR NEW USERS
    ## However, you should never include a bridge&#39;s fingerprint here, as it would
    ## break its concealability and potentially reveal its IP/TCP address.
    #MyFamily $keyid,$keyid,...

    ## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They&#39;re considered first
    ## to last, and the first match wins.
    ##
    ## If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules

    ## IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules
    ## using accept/reject *4.
    ##
    ## If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end this with either a
    ## reject *:* or an accept *:*. Otherwise, you&#39;re _augmenting_ (prepending to)
    ## the default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
    ## described in the man page or at
    ## ONLY 5 LINKS ALLOWED FOR NEW USERS
    ##
    ## Look at ONLY 5 LINKS ALLOWED FOR NEW USERS

    ##
    ## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
    ## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
    ## users will be told that those destinations are down.
    ##
    ## For security, by default Tor rejects connections to private (local)
    ## networks, including to the configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
    ## and any public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on any interface on the relay.
    ## See the man page entry for ExitPolicyRejectPrivate if you want to allow

    #ExitPolicy accept6 *6:119 # accept nntp ports on IPv6 only as well as default exit policy
    #ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed

    ## Bridge relays (or &quot;bridges&quot;) are Tor relays that aren&#39;t listed in the
    ## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
    ## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
    ## won&#39;t be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won&#39;t treat you
    ## differently because they won&#39;t know you&#39;re running Tor. If you can
    ## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
    #BridgeRelay 1
    ## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
    ## mechanisms like ONLY 5 LINKS ALLOWED FOR NEW USER. If you want to run
    ## a private bridge, for example because you&#39;ll give out your bridge
    ## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
    #PublishServerDescriptor 0

## Bridge relays (or "bridges") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
#BridgeRelay 1
## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
## mechanisms like ONLY 5 LINKS ALLOWED FOR NEW USER. If you want to run
## a private bridge, for example because you'll give out your bridge
## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
#PublishServerDescriptor 0
