    <title>Poll: Configuration Files for Different Host Distro</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/poll-configuration-files-for-different-host-distro/935</link>
    <description>Over time the differences between libvirt on Debian and on other distros like Fedora, will grow because of their different release cycles. The best solution I can think of is to maintain different XML files for these host distros to avoid support issues about incompatibilities.

At the moment most Whonix KVM users that have talked to me are Debian users. Is there anybody who uses KVM on another major distro?</description>
