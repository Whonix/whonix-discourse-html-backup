    <description>Hi.

For a long time I have observed, and now every day while that I&#39;m active here at the moment, I find the forum&#39;s script that hijacks one&#39;s Ctrl-F page searching in Firefox to be extremely annoying and preventive of what I find to be a basic normal everyday part of using an Internet forum.

I use Ctrl-F all the time to instantly search text I wrote my a previous posts on the same thread page so I can know what I said before.

Some script hijacks it and forces you off the thread page and suddenly somewhere else. Ridiculous. All I wanted was to search the page I&#39;m on and find a word in about 1.5 seconds.

Since this is hyper specific to this forum however, I suppose I could find the script and block it in an add-on.

Is there a good reason to have this forum feature left on?

Thanks

            <p>Unfortunately, I’m seeing that native Firefox searching of previous text written in a given thread doesn’t always work anyway.</p>
<p>I think it’s because threads don’t fully load the whole pages as actual HTML data on the page but dynamically in JavaScript.</p>
<p>That sucks. But then other forum softwares don’t load the entire thread history in one immediately searchable page either. I guess I just have to get used to how discourse presents forum threads.</p>
