    <description>I am using vpn over tor scheme. Works a bit slowly, but pretty nice. But sometimes conenction just dissapears. OpeVPN GUI lights with green (win 7), but there&#39;s no traffic. I am trying to disconnect from vpn and check tor only traffic, but no good. Why is that happening, how should I debug and fix it? Thx.</description>

<p>Your using a Custom Windows-Whonix workstation? Whonix does not support Windows.</p>
<p>If you would like support you can use a supported platform and use the following connect to Tor before a VPN instructions. Otherwise your questoin can be answered as per the <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Support#Free_Support_Principle</a></p>
<p><strong>Supported Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Follow <em>All</em> of the <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN" rel="nofollow noopener">Connecting to Tor before a VPN</a> instructions. Be sure to follow “Prevent Bypassing of the Tunnel-Link” which is also on the page. This is to prevent unexpected results such as broken connectivity and/or traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and only going through Tor.</p>

            <p>I am connecting to VPN from workstation (virutal machine) through whonix gateway, so its VPN after TOR. The problem is that sometimes connection dissapears. I cant connect anywhere though OpenVPN GUI lights green. When I am disconnecting VPN and leave only whonix’s tor, there is no connection too. It appears again only after rebooting whonix GW virtual machine.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>squarebob</code></p>
<p>If you are using <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels" rel="nofollow noopener">Tunnel</a> instructions from the Whonix wiki please follow the steps provided on <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_a_VPN_before_Tor#How_to_Submit_a_Support_Request" rel="nofollow noopener">How to submit a VPN support request.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>If you are using a VPN on the host, its Tor over VPN. The following terminology if preferred to prevent misunderstanding.</p>
<p>User -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; Internet</p>
<p>If VPN is on the host:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am trying to disconnect from vpn and check tor only traffic, but no good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what “No good” means. You were able to disconnect VPN. You were not able to disconnect VPN?</p>
