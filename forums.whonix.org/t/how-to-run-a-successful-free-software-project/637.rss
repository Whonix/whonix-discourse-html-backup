    <title>How to Run a Successful Free Software Project</title>

    <description>This is a recommendation for a Libre / Free book that applies to the Whonix Libre Software project. Link to the online version of the book:

Table of Contents:

http://producingoss.com/en/index.html

Especially important I find at the moment chapter 4,  [Social and Political Infrastructure](http://producingoss.com/en/social-infrastructure.html) that discusses leadership, decision finding, participation, voting rights, voting systems, polls, consensus and more.

I wanted to keep this blog post neutral and only informative. In another blog posts I am following up with other useful concepts such as

* consensus, the systemic consensus principle,
* lazy consensus,
* do-ocracy,
* as well as with the current state of decision finding / participation

in Whonix development. See:

After that I plan on starting a discussion on how we want to handle these things in Whonix.</description>

    [html] Introduction
The general concept of democracy in its widest use of the term isn’t infallible. Not a perfect system. It stands and falls with the people. While it’s not perfect, it’s the best I’ve experienced implemented in reality. Not just in state politics. 
To my knowledge, on the state governmental level, in my opinion we never really had a “real democracy” anywhere in the world. Speaking about medium/average sized and medium/average populated countries here. (Mostly speaking about Ge…
