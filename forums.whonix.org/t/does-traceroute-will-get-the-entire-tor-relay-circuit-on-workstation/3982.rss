    <title>Does traceroute will get the entire tor relay circuit on workstation?</title>

    <description>Hi,

Whonix is great.

My question: Assume a malware is on Whonix-Workstation that has ability do traceroute.
This malware using tcp syn do traceroute, Whether it will get the whole tor relay circuit like arm on Whonix-Gateway.

I can see the entire tor relay connections on Whonix-Gateway using arm tool. that is OK, because the place is  Whonix-Gateway.

But if I or malware can see the entire tor relay circuit on Whonix-Workstation, I think that is a bad idea. because this will expose my ip location.

Whether Whonix has this problem or my worry is superfluous?


Thank you everyone.</description>

            <p>Malware can only find out that you are using a Gateway and which exit node is used (assuming that the malware is unable to break into the gateway or out of the VM).<br>
A traceroute can’t leak your entire circuit because no relaying node will respond to your TCP SYN as they only forward encrypted packets (i.e. they don’t even see that you sent a TCP SYN packet) and the exit node will probably also just forward the packet to its final destination.</p>
