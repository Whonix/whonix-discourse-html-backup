    <description>Opening this ticket on support because not sure it is development as nothing is planned.

Could Whonix.org host an onion git repository?
I guess the answer is yes but currently not hosting it by a matter of hosting cost? Because I saw an issue about deleting git history on gitlab just to not exceed the free limit.

When would this be useful?
- well, if using gitlab, could see issues and pull requests, although the current policy states to discuss issues on this forum
- so the other clear answer is gitolite or gitea for just browsing the source code

Why? Just to browse the code?
- No, I would like like to make anonymous commits and whonix repos not connected to nyxnor. Although the git structure needs to keep a history of who made the commits, this still sounds a better idea for not depending on github or gitlab.
- Sometimes just exploring the code without having to clone the repo, saving bandwidth.

<ul>
<li>Anonymously git clone from github or github.</li>
<li>Benefit from git’s decentralized nature. Git push the git branch to any repository anywhere.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think so because I still would need an account on github to push the code.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. Pushing a git branch doesn’t require github or gitlab. Just because Whonix has accounts at github and gitlab that doesn’t mean contribution needs an account at either service.</p>
<p>Any git repository anywhere on the clearnet or onion would be acceptable. Either at a third party host. Lets say an account at <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/">https://savannah.gnu.org/</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a> could be used to host a git branch.</p>
<p>I could easily <code>git remote add</code> a repository which someone has pushed to savannah or sourceforge and wouldn’t need an account there myself. What I would do is an anonymous clone.</p>
<p>Even self-hosting an onion with gitlab, gitweb or anything other git compatible with be OK.</p>
<p>That’s what I meant with git is decentralized.</p>
<p>(Maybe related: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hosting_Location_Hidden_Services" class="inline-onebox">Hosting Location Hidden Services - Whonix</a>)</p>
<p>Last but not least, git is compatible with “e-mail”. Patches can (and regularity are for other projects) sent by e-mail. But even e-mail is optional. Plain text submission anywhere such as forums should suffice. A local git branch (anonymous clone from git(hub/lab) without account is sufficient. With the help of <code>git-format-patch</code> a text file can be created which could very most likely even be pasted here in this forum. That text file could be copied/pasted and applied in a local branch for review and then merged.</p>
<p>As for security, we shouldn’t rely on either TLS or onion anyhow. Not even on any servers. Whonix’s source code wouldn’t be compromised if all servers currently hosting it would be maliciously. That’s because I have a local copy on my local disk. For security, the important thing is to sign git commits and to verify git commits before merging.</p>
<p>As for users git cloning a repository it’s best for security to verify git commit signatures. (That’s documented in Whonix images build documentation as well as Whonix package build documentation.)</p>
<p>Currently if TLS or github/gitlab was ever compromised that would be caught when gpg verifying the git commit after git clone/fetch.</p>
<p>Currently Whonix onions suffer from the same issue as other onions hosted on a (commercial) server. Once the server is compromised, the attacker can impersonate the onion. There’s no onion domain hierarchical seed phrase (similar to cryptocurrencies) which can be used to spawn any number of onions from and there’s no revocation mechanism either.</p>
<p>TLS is standard. onion is kinda a “gimmick”. gpg is still the gold standard for git since that transcends all man-in-the-middle attacks (assuming previous secure transfer for gpg fingerprint and correct gpg usage). Related:</p>

<p>I guess this is an educated no haha. I would rather host an onion git once I have time to setup one also.</p>

<p>It would be great to see how the configs looks like. I saw the thread with mig5 helping harden those headers, but in the end, not knowing exactly what was done does not help others implement on their own webservers.</p>

<p>Yeah. I was wondering about that. If there was a lot of oversight and contributions to the server config, it would also be interesting to have the server config fully public in git.</p>
<p>But since for most repositories that’s not happening (unspecific to Whonix, projects have 1 or very few maintainers with occasionally contributors but very few keeping maximum scrutiny), I kept it private for better security (through obscurity).</p>
<p>Most projects don’t publish their server config.</p>

<p>Good question.</p>
<p>I’d have to Open Source parts of even most of of Whonix server config. Lots of goodies there. Same config hosts <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> as well as <a href="http://kicksecure.com">kicksecure.com</a> thanks to a search/replace script. (Using similar webapps, mediawiki, discourse.) It’s all static config files in a local debian package with as little scripting as possible.</p>
<p>Lots of stuff implemented such as suggestions <a href="http://hardenize.com">hardenize.com</a>, <a href="http://ssllabs.com">ssllabs.com</a> test, <a href="http://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a>. (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Privacy_Policy_Technical_Details" class="inline-onebox">Privacy Policy Technical Details - Kicksecure</a>)</p>
<p>The Open Sourcing process would probably best be step by step. Then you’d locally reproduce it (setting up alternative onion, same webapps, clearnet somewhat optional). Perhaps report/fix issues, document stuff so the process gets easier for others later on.</p>
<p>Once the existing setup becomes clear, it might be possible to contribute new stuff.</p>

            <p>Opening this ticket on support because not sure it is development as nothing is planned.</p>
<p>Could <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Whonix.org</a> host an onion git repository?<br>
I guess the answer is yes but currently not hosting it by a matter of hosting cost? Because I saw an issue about deleting git history on gitlab just to not exceed the free limit.</p>
<p>When would this be useful?</p>
<ul>
<li>well, if using gitlab, could see issues and pull requests, although the current policy states to discuss issues on this forum</li>
<li>so the other clear answer is gitolite or gitea for just browsing the source code</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? Just to browse the code?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, I would like like to make anonymous commits and whonix repos not connected to nyxnor. Although the git structure needs to keep a history of who made the commits, this still sounds a better idea for not depending on github or gitlab.</li>
<li>Sometimes just exploring the code without having to clone the repo, saving bandwidth.</li>

    Glad that’s sorted. 

I haven’t tested that but I don’t see why not as long as internal IPs are correctly configured (custom-workstation network configuration and Whonix-Gateway Tor configuration). You can see this as “A VM running nginx which is connected to another VM thorugh internal LAN to another VM running Tor”.
