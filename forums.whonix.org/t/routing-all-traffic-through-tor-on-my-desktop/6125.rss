    <title>Routing all traffic through Tor on my desktop?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/routing-all-traffic-through-tor-on-my-desktop/6125</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m not sure if this is possible, but I have an old T400 with Libreboot on it. I am currently running Trisquel 8. Virtualization doesn&#39;t work so well on the older machine unfortunately, so I was wondering if there is a way to make all my traffic on my PC run through Tor (or whonix?)? I&#39;ve tried using privoxy, and Torghost, but they don&#39;t seem to work.

Any idea how I can do this? My goal is when I start the PC to have all the connections go through Tor.</description>

            <p>Take a look at the Whonix Gateway firewall rules or similar rules for a Tor proxy on the web. Or if you want to use Whonix you either need to use a second PC (low power/cheap) which acts as Whonix Gateway. Or you try to only run the Gateway as a VM with 256 MB RAM and attach the hosts network interface to the VM and use the second interface to connect to the host, so your host would be the Workstation. Anyways you either loose some isolation or in the second case some of the privacy features (like hiding hardware serials etc.)</p>
