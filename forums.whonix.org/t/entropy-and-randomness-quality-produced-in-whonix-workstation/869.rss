    <description>Entropy and randomness are important for encryption, especially for systems like GPG that do not have forward secrecy. How much should users trust Whonix-Workstation&#39;s entropy?

Is it ALWAYS better to generate gpg keys and other sensitive entropy heavy processes on the host system (outside Whonix machines)?</description>

            <p>If entropy was not trusted, then also https connections and whole Tor could not be trusted. According to my research, it’s a rabbit hole and no one really knows anything definitive. It’s not viewed as an open vulnerability at the moment by any virtualization users. But no one can prove a negative. Especially not with entropy. See also:<br>
