<p>Mostly fixed in 8.6.4.2 (which will eventually become Whonix 9 after a few more changes), except for <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2800_create-report">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix/blob/master/build-steps.d/2800_create-report</a> - but I am not sure that build step is useful for bare metal users anyway.</p>

            <p>[quote=“Cerberus, post:3, topic:129”]One suggestion:<br>
If we introduce virtualbox as a build dependency (as it is due to vboxmanage), we should take care that it is properly installed/configured. I.e. we should also pull the respective kernel-headers. Even if we just need vboxmanage for the VM build process, pulling virtualbox without ensuring that it’s setup correctly due to missing kernel-headers doesn’t sound too good to me (might be confusing to users). That said, pulling kernel-headers wouldn’t interfere with a possible Oracle virtualbox neither, needed anyways - whether Debian or Oracle (I’m sorry that I haven’t commented yet within the respective thread - I’m a bit busy the next week(s)).[/quote]<br>
VirtualBox is a build dependency for non-bare-metal builds already. And must remain one for future --vbox build targets.</p>

<p>It should more or less cover your suggestion. With the only limitation, that it fails open. As the info message explains, I guess this is the best approach here. Please check.</p>
