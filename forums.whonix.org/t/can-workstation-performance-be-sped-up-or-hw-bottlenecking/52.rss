Debian wheezy 7.1 64 as host. Two guest OS&#39;s through Virtualbox - whonix workstation 7 and gateway 7.

in Virtualbox workstation has 954 working memory assigned to it, 128 mb video memory. 
Gateway has 324 mb, 8 mb respectively (runs in console mode).

Increasing above is the only tip regarding increasing performance in whonix documentation have, however it&#39;s advised against in virtualbox (for workstation) to increase more

HW specs:
2GB RAM
athlon 64x dual core 3800 + x2 

The workstation is slow overall. Opening Dolphin file manager takes 8 seconds. Opening more than about 20 tabs in TOR browser have resulted in freezing the OS, which goes away if waiting. It&#39;s only used for browsing through TOR, and sometimes navigating the file system. 

BIOS has a setting for virtualization, but it doesn&#39;t apply to this setup (as far as I remember, going to reboot and check the wording again). 

Any point to me trying to researching and configuring for performance, or simply HW (I&#39;m guessing CPU) too crappy?</description>

            <p>You could get bare-metal speed using whonix in qubes-os. But Xen code was hacked by the NSA guy, so you cannot trust it. Also qemu-kvm still does not provide any hardware-based solutions like XEN.</p>

I don’t see the connection between Whonix performance and StackExchange eventually being not tor friendly.<br>
[/quote]Right, in the sticky it says to take these kinds of questions to SE. Since I was unable to post there, I made a post here, explaning why.[/quote]<br>
FYI: not sure about stackexchange in particular, but lots of websites do not block Tor per se but certain exit nodes (often automated through integrated anti-spam solutions). you may try to close the current curcuit and reload the page (through another curcuit) and you may be able to use the site.</p>

            <p>Usually asking on stackexchange works. If not well… Anyway… Certainly okay to ask here this kind of question.</p>
<p>No idea what kind of performance can be expected from that kind of hardware.</p>
<p>BIOS virtualization setting is important. If you wouldn’t have AMD-V (VT-X) enabled, you would know. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Starting_Whonix#Whonix_does_not_start.3F">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Starting_Whonix#Whonix_does_not_start.3F</a>)</p>
<p>I am not sure I can do anything about it. Most times these aren’t issues introduced by Whonix. Can you try please installing Debian KDE in VirtualBox and compare speed?</p>
