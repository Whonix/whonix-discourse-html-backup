    <title>Multiple Workstations on same host?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-workstations-on-same-host/462</link>
    <description>Is there a wiki page that covers this topic, particularly:

- a brief step by step setup HOWTO, like the one for using other operating systems as workstation
- security implications of running multiple worstations on same host

I want to set up a hidden service, I&#39;d need a second virtualbox whonix workstation instance so I can test its functionality from there by trying to connect to it, but I don&#39;t know where to start. Would I need a second gateway - workstation pair? Could I use the same gateway for the second workstation as well instead? Can I deploy a second workstation by using the same template, importing it into virtualbox under a different name, then changing some settings, or the process is more complicated? It&#39;s questions like these I&#39;m looking for answers to.</description>

<p>I want to set up a hidden service, I’d need a second virtualbox whonix workstation instance so I can test its functionality from there by trying to connect to it, but I don’t know where to start. Would I need a second gateway - workstation pair? Could I use the same gateway for the second workstation as well instead? Can I deploy a second workstation by using the same template, importing it into virtualbox under a different name, then changing some settings, or the process is more complicated? It’s questions like these I’m looking for answers to.</p>
