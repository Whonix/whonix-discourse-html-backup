    <description>Dear all,

I checked previous topics and the search field, and yet I couldn&#39;t find an answer to my question, so here it goes.

I update both gateway and workstation daily; the gateway updates smoothly, yet for 3 days I get the same error in workstation after I insert in command:

&gt; user@host:~$ upgrade-nonroot

I wonder what the problem is. Btw I am a kinda of a noob so please be gentle with the explanation/solution ;) . I appreciate your time and knowledge.

Have a good one.

            <p>Thank you Patrick, Ill keep that entry in mind.</p>
<p>The following is very off topic, but it is quite a simple question, and I can always move it for a separate topic if the explanation is valid for more people searching for this.</p>
<p>I understand that opening Tor full-window and add any add-ons besides those already installed makes you stand out from the crowd if I understood correctly, yet when it comes to customizing the workstation such as changing appearance to dark mode, and moving folders and that I wonder if it does the same effect…</p>
<p>I appreciate the feedback, and thank you again</p>

            <p>Dear Patrick,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and all the hard work.</p>
<p>I went the easy route as I did not have much content there, so I re-installed everything, with success regarding the ca-certificates ultimately.</p>
<p>May not be logic, but maybe in one instance I typed “y” instead of “Y” (capital Y) + enter in cmd when approving upgrades. May that be the reason for not installing them in the first place?.. even though it may seem awkward as an explanation; the thing is, I really did not do anything else at all besides commanding upgrade-nonroot in both gateway and workstation and continuing on, so I can only call this the reason behind it.</p>
<p>I really appreciate all the help.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>

            <p>It seems very conceivable to me that a package was installed or removed which resulted in removal of a Whonix meta packages. Upon running <code>sudo apt autoremove</code>, the <code>ca-certifcates</code> was uninstalled which is required for https (TLS) verification.</p>
