    <title>Tor&#39;s control port could not be reached</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tors-control-port-could-not-be-reached/1569</link>
    <description>I am getting this same error suddenly and consistently today, also from within Workstation. &quot;Tor&#39;s control port could not be reached&quot;, etc...

I haven&#39;t changed anything, it just started occurring. Tor bootstrap test still says connected to Tor, and http://check.torproject.org reports connected to Tor.

But Whonixcheck produces this error each time I&#39;ve restarted Workstation so far, today.</description>

<p>I don’t think so… I was just remembering that version from another error months ago, I think, and typing it hastily in a rush. It was the same as the other user’s error, TransPort rather than control port. But it has since gone away and I haven’t seen it again, so I can’t check for sure. Probably just a temporary network/Tor issue.</p>

<p>Please post the full output of whonixcheck.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry Patrick… the full output was exactly identical to the text posted by new2this in the other thread. I was just paraphrasing with what I typed. I am not at my Whonix machine right now, and am not sure how to copy and paste the output from the Whonixcheck popup dialog. But was this:</p>

<p>I am using KVM under Linux Mint. The problem did seem to go away the last time I restarted last night, so perhaps it was just transient as you say, and self-resolved after the Tor network corrected the issue.</p>
