    <title>Configure VPN server on firewall to secure local WiFi connection</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/configure-vpn-server-on-firewall-to-secure-local-wifi-connection/7637</link>
    <description>Both WPA2 and WPA3 have numerous vulnerabilities (known and likely unknown). Lets assume:

* The attacker somehow already has the WPA2(3) encryption key. 
* You have an firewall distribution on which you can configure a VPN (server) for you laptop VPN (client) to secure local WiFi connections.

1. If the VPN is configured properly, and the firewall is locked down, can the attacker gain access to the firewall?
2. Could an [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) (for expample, [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator) ) be used to further lock down the VPN?
 **Note:** its possible to set up I&#39;m just curious if it would be worth the effort.

Why do this?

I&#39;m assuming not everyone sits at a desk with their laptop plugged into an ethernet port. Actually I bet most people don&#39;t. This could enhance security for the majority of end users.

**And** it looks like it would be fun to experiment with. So lets keep this on topic. i.e. not about how bad WPA is.

<p>I don’t think so. Connections between VPN clients and VPN servers should<br>
be secure. Whether a tiny part (in destination) of the connection is<br>
properly secured or not (from notebook to home router) should not<br>
influence anything.</p>

<p>Not directly, not that I know. 2FA (perhaps yubikey) can be used as a<br>
second factor for 2FA authentication to the VPN and/or SSH.</p>
