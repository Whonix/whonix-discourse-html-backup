    <title>Audio high/low pitched?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/audio-high-low-pitched/15946</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t reproduce this issue on my other 2 ubuntu vbox VM&#39;s, so it seems to be specific to whonix. When I&#39;m playing short videos on VLC or MPV inside whonix 16.0.8.2 for vbox, I notice videos will a lot of times either be high pitched or low pitched until I restart the VM (it can take several restarts before the pitch issue goes away). I&#39;ve tried from 10gb of RAM to 2gb of ram allocated to the VM and 2-3 CPUs allocated, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have an effect. 

Also had this issue on older whonix versions as well.</description>

            <p>Whonix doesn’t change sound settings inside the VMs. I don’t remember anything related changing in Whonix source code. Debian, VirtualBox and/or the Linux kernel might have had related changes that I am not aware of.</p>
<p>You could try changing the VirtualBox host software sound audio settings.</p>
<p>See VirtualBox documentation:<br>
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/settings-audio.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.oracle.com/en/virtualization/virtualbox/6.0/user/settings-audio.html</a></p>
<p>Try changing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Host Audio Driver</code></li>
<li><code>Audio Controller</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Compare the audio setting with VMs where this isn’t happening.</p>
<p>Related to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction">Bug Reports, Software Development and Feature Requests chapter Generic Bug Reproduction in Whonix wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find some settings where this issue doesn’t happen.</p>
