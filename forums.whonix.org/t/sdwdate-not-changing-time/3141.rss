    <description>So I know sdwdate is set in UTC. My host clock is also utc. However it seems that the WS and GW and host all have identical time. Isn&#39;t there supposed to be a slight difference? I remember  previous whonix versions had at least 30 min difference or something..</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>First of all, a difference of 30min or more doesn’t sound right, as such a massive difference between every Whonix-User would make each of them more trackable, not less, which is why your previous experience may either be missremembered or based on some other (unknown?) issue.</p>
<p>Secondly, and because of this, your clock is only “set randomly between 5 and 180 seconds into the past or future”, as you may read here: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#Facts">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/TimeSync#Facts</a></p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To be exact: Whonix Debian settings are set to UTC. sdwdate itself<br>
does not mind about local clock settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My host clock is also utc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That we have never recommended.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However it seems that the WS and GW and host all have identical<br>
time. Isn’t there supposed to be a slight difference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference is by coincidence / sdwdate inaccuracy. Not by<br>
comparing with the host. So in theory the difference could be 0 but<br>
that is unlikely. And the difference should also change when you<br>
reboot Whonix.</p>
<p>Difference should be seconds.</p>
<p>In Qubes there is a convenient way to see sys-whonix vs dom0 difference.</p>
<pre><code> qvm-run --pass-io sys-whonix date &amp;&amp; date
</code></pre>
<p>Are you sure clock is equal up to the second?</p>
<blockquote>

or something…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
