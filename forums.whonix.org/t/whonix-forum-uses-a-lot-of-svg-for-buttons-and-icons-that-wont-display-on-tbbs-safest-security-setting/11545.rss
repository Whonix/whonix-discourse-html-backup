    <title>Whonix forum uses a lot of SVG for buttons and icons that won&#39;t display on TBB&#39;s &quot;Safest&quot; security setting</title>

    <description>The buttons for markup when making a post like bold etc all use SVG, which on TBB&#39;s highest security setting do not display. Hovering over them I get their title though which makes them usable. 

When making a post there is a button above the title and next to &quot;Create a new Topic&quot; which is empty, inspecting it I think it is some kind of dropdown menu, but I don&#39;t know. Has id &quot;ember1094&quot;. 

I don&#39;t know of what importance this kind of &quot;usability&quot; is to the Whonix project, thought I&#39;d bring it up though in case it is. If not that&#39;s understandable, low hanging fruit here. The SVG stuff isn&#39;t significant for security here since needing to enable JS to post anyway, which I dislike because of poor performance at least while on Tor, so more about usability again there, but I digress.. lmao.</description>
