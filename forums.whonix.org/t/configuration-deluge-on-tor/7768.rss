    <title>Configuration deluge on tor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/configuration-deluge-on-tor/7768</link>
    <description>I know we already talked about this, but the Q&amp;A I found here and googling doesn&#39;t suit my issue.

I&#39;ve read that I shouldn&#39;t do that for several reasons (and take a look to the alternatives and probably an affordable seedbox will be the best option). Even though that, I&#39;m struggling to get it working but currently I cant.

Based on what I read, to get it work, first all I have to run Tor browser and successful initiate it. I got that, tor browser running with all ok. Then I launched Deluge, Edit -&gt; Preferences, and for each field (Peer, Web seeds, Tracker and DHT) Sockv5, 127.0.0.1, port 9050 and restart Deluge. But doesn&#39;t work at all... Deluge is working good without that configuration.

I&#39;ve been trying to track that with Wireshark, I noticed that source port for TCP Tor connections is 9666. Also tried that port and get nothing. Also tried as Sockv4 and Sockv5 W/ Auth. Ping at 127.0.0.1 is ok and I can &#39;ssh 127.0.0.1&#39;.

nmap 127.0.0.1 -&gt; 22/25/80/111/631/9418 are open.</description>

<p>Well then you already know it is the digital equivalent of being an asshole. It’s easy enough to get working if you are determined but we won;'t go out of our way to help you drain limited resources that  some people badly need.</p>
