    <title>MiTM Attack on RDP using Whonix?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/mitm-attack-on-rdp-using-whonix/10120</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

this isn&#39;t specifically Whonix related but as the Tor forum is archived I hope it&#39;s the right section for my post.
For some months now I&#39;m using Whonix to connect to an RDP anonymously, without an .onion service installed so every time I use exit nodes.

Well the following weird thing have happened:

The SSL certificate suddenly changed when I established a new connection to the rp, I don&#39;t know who was the issuer but I haven&#39;t changed anything on that RDP.

I declined and restarted TOR, I go no new SSL certificate confirmation/ question.

I assume this is an MiTM attack to sniff RDP connections? Question is now, was this a broad attack or could I be targetted specifically?</description>

<p>Yes sounds like MITM.</p>

<p>What difference does it make? Your servers integrity would be violated either way. If you think you are targeted you should make use of onions again.</p>

            <p>I don’t know. It’s a general Tor question and therefore you could use:</p>
