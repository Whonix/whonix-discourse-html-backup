    <title>Infinite loop after(or while) dist-upgrade</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/infinite-loop-after-or-while-dist-upgrade/5328</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried to run `apt-get dist-upgrade` on Whonix-Gateway(Whonix-Workstation might also be affected as it froze once when I tried to dist-upgrade it but it may also be caused by the many windows I had open). The last time I called apt was for an upgrade(not dist-upgrade) and it succeeded.

It starts not to accept any keystrokes when installing the kernel if I remember correctly(it took some time when it reached that step so I went AFK). The output now looks like this:
![loop|584x500](upload://oAZNjGTdhjV6RXj5jX8dzwdsWX8.png)
As we can see, the information at the end is the same as the information at the beginning(this looks like it&#39;s stuck in an infinite loop).</description>

            <p>My best advice to you is to rollback to a clean snapshot and try again. Make it a habit to take a snapshot before you even do first boot. Sometimes mysterious bugs that crop up can be made to disappear that way.</p>

            <p>The host has about 4 GB RAM, Whonix-Workstation has 1747 MB. I thought I had given Whonix-Gateway max RAM already(having a cli). It was at 120 MB something or 160 MB something. I can’t remember anymore. Whonix-Gateway seems to be working now after RAM was raised. According to the link you sent, 256 MB is the minimum. This may explain why the Gateway had problems.</p>
<p>I will try to see if I am able to allocate a good amount of RAM for the Workstation later(I currently do not have enough time to do it immediately.).</p>

            <p>Hi <code>kranatafa</code></p>
<p>What hypervisor are you using? How much RAM do you have allocated to Whonix-Gateway/Workstation VMs?. If you had similar problems with Whonix-Workstation due to to many tabs open (not enough RAM) it may be a similar issue with both VMs</p>
<p>First try shutting down all unnecessary processes on your host and try updating Whonix-Gateway. (without Whonix-Workstation running)</p>
<p>If that does not work try increasing RAM in Whonix-Gateway using rads.</p>
<p>Then decreasing to RAM to minimum, 512 for a desktop environment, 256 for terminal-only</p>

I think I should wait.<br>
According to virt-manager, the guest’s CPU is almost unused(at least when I’m looking).<p></p>
<p>EDIT: I noticed characters have been cut while taking the screeshot. It’s only one character each line that’s been cut, so it should still be readable.</p>
<p>EDIT2: I’m using the stable repository.</p>
