    <title>2FA key in whonix workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/2fa-key-in-whonix-workstation/13124</link>
    <description>I have an Onlykey (similar to a Yubikey) but it also auto types logins, passwords and other security-related output.   It works well in other VMs (Debian and Fedora-based) but it does not work in my whonix-ws qube. 

I use sys-usb to connect it to various VMs but nothing is output when connect to my whonix-ws VM and attempt to use it within Tor Browser, mousepad or other whonix-ws applications.

The device is recognized as a keyboard by Linux systems.  Is there a security setting that prevents unknown keyboards from injecting text into Whonix?   Any idea how to get this working?

Thanks.</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>  Thanks for your reply.   The problem is identical to topic 11410 where you advised the user to consult with Qubes support.  However, Qubes support says it’s a Whonix issue.</p>
<p>For example, when I create a Whonix 16 VM with HVM virtualization and directly connect the USB PCI controller to Whonix, the USB HID device does not output text.   The behavior is the same when I use sys-usb and passthrough the HID device to Whonix.  USB storage drives mount and operate with no problem.  It’s just the USB HID that doesn’t output properly.</p>
<p>It seems that Whonix recognizes the USB device as connected but doesn’t manage it like a HID.  Is it possible that Whonix is assuming that it is a block device or some other USB device?</p>
<p>For instance, I know that the .vmx file in VMware needs to be modified with “allowHID” to properly handle keyboard devices via USB.</p>
<p>The device shows up as connected with <code>lsusb</code> and has entries in <code> /sys</code> and <code>/dev</code>.   When I compare the output of <code>journalctl -b</code> with my Debian VM (where the HID operates properly), the only significant difference I noticed was that Debian runs “MTP-probe” with a line confirming that the device is not a media device.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts.  I have no idea how to fix this and I really need to get this operational with my Whonix workstation.  Any chance you could plug a USB keyboard into Whonix (either sys-usb passthrough or with the PCI controller directly connected to Whonix) and see if anything looks suspect?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and effort.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not.</p>
<p>Seems unlikely to get resolved unless as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Generic_Bug_Reproduction">Generic Bug Reproduction</a> and might require moderate technical skill to debug.</p>
<p>Comparing <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#System_Logs">System Logs</a> Whonix (broken) and non-Whonix (functional) might help.</p>
