    <description>Hi,
i received ths error when i tried to send public key to the server ( onion and clear ) : 

libtorsocks(15728): connect: Connection is to a local address (10.152.152.10), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks. 

The first message told me that all it&#39;s ok but my key isn&#39;t present to the servers ...
I don&#39;t know what i&#39;d do .</description>

            <p>That gui message is unrelated. There are many of such messages, for example when starting kate from terminal. Feel free to reproduce them using and against Debian or KDE.</p>
<p>I don’t know why this is happening.</p>
<p>If you run, ‘export UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=“1”’ it’s only active for that one terminal window. Not for the whole system.</p>
<p>Yes, better to not don’t mix up activities using the TransPort.</p>

            <h2>Perhaps i understood uwt wrapper .<br>
I followed your advise and it’s works .<br>
I received these messages on command line :</h2>
<h2>session D-Bus connection created before QCoreApplication. Application may misbehave<br>
kgpg(9963)/kdeui (kdelibs) KDialogPrivate::queuedLayoutUpdate: KeyExport created with a layout; don’t do that, KDialog takes care of it, use mainWidget or setMainWidget instead .</h2>
<p>It seems a GUI problem, but all it’s ok, the key has been uploaded .</p>
<p>For the network problem, i don’t know the real problem, maybe the socks port has some problem, in fact with transport port it runs correctly .<br>
The important thing is to do once a time thing for separating activities when I turn off this wrapper, right ?</p>

            <p>No clearnet connections from within Whonix-Workstation possible unless you make extensive changes to Whonix-Gateway. So no clearnet connection with KGpg.</p>
<p>The security issue is very minor. Pollution of the TransPort, which is a non-perfect stream isolation. You can learn about these nuances by studying that page.</p>
