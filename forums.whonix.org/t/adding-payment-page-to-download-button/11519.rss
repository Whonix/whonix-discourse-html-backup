    <description>I think its nice idea as well to merge payment page with download button meaning once someone click on it he will have page something like this one: (actually even it can get bigger to include entire donate page with it)

            <p>It’s a reasonable hypothesis. Worth exploring.</p>
<p>elementary has that too in form of a “pay what you want”.+</p>

<p>Whonix has already plenty call for donations. I guess it’s a bell curve.</p>
<ul>
<li>With too few and too invisible calls for donations these will be less.</li>
<li>The right number of calls in the right places will yield best results.</li>
<li>Too many obnoxious calls and hoops will yield less then best results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whonix is  way too complicated to use anyhow. Getting started is difficult. Specifically for users who never used any Linux distribution and/or virtualizer. Usually users want one thing and then not be interrupted with other things. If that happens, bounce rate goes up. I.e. a new users wants to download Whonix, then gets interrupted with such a screen, perhaps mistakenly getting impression paid only and then giving up on Whonix altogether.</p>
<p>Without any data which approach works better (current or suggested) for more new users and/or more donations, it cannot be reasoned about it. Professional other business would track user behavior, collect data, <code>A/B testing</code> / <code>split testing</code>. They don’t hesitate to use google analytics, other tracking.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is that such tracking would look bad on the Whonix website. There’s supposedly privacy friendly, Open Source tracking.</p>

<p>But I haven’t looked into that.</p>
<p>Then also this is custom web code. Not trivially integrated with mediawiki. Doesn’t support crypto currencies.</p>
<p>Therefore I don’t think I’ll be working on that anytime soon.</p>
