    <title>Continuous Integration for testing application proxy leaks?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/continuous-integration-for-testing-application-proxy-leaks/3905</link>
    <description>Has anyone tried using continuous integration tools like Travis CI to find proxy leaks in applications?  The rough idea I had was to run all the existing unit/integration tests for the application, wrapped in something like `strace -f -e trace=socket,getsockopt,setsockopt,getsockname,connect,bind,send,sendto,sendmsg,recv,recvfrom,recvmsg ./run_tests.sh` and use `grep` on the resulting output to find any results that connect to anything other than the configured proxy.  (This assumes that the application has good test coverage already.)  I&#39;m curious if someone has already tried to tackle this, or if there&#39;s a better way.

(H/t to pabouk at https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/118 for the idea of using `strace`.)</description>
