    <description>I&#39;ve been practicing my Python lately - hopefully, I&#39;ll have code to contribute in the future. I need to pick a GUI toolkit going forward. I see @iry and @troubadour are using PyQT5. Is that to stay native to KDE? or do you have strong opinions on that choice? The alternative would be to study PyGObjects per Qubes&#39; guidelines (and consistency with their future GNOME integration). I&#39;ve used .Net before - is it fair to say these toolkits are all somewhat similar?</description>

<p>Sounds great! Looking forward to seeing your code in the future, <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/entr0py">@entr0py</a>!</p>

<p>I myself do not have a strong a opinion on what we should use. The<br>
reason why I use PyQt5 to develop anon-connection-wizard is because it<br>
had been written in PyQt by <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/troubadour">@troubadour</a> by the time I started.</p>
<p>However, maybe we can discuss and research the the most suitable toolkit<br>
for development.</p>
<p>For example, I know that Tails is mainly using GTK applications.<br>
Therefore, if you would like to develop an general application which may<br>
also benefit Tails, and Whonix does not consider GTK as a problem, then<br>
we may consider to use GTK, too.</p>

            <p>Not an expert here. However I know that an advantage of PyQt is its cross platform implementation besides the underlying GUI framework being a first class citizen on KDE.</p>
