    <title>USB Keyboard support for whonix-ws-15 based disp vms</title>

    <description>Hi,

This reiterates a question I asked in vain on the QubesOS google list ...

In Qubes4.0 I&#39;m fond of using torbrowser in a whonix-ws-15 based app VM for all
browsing that possibly works.

In parallel I manage all authentication using a Mooltipass device for
the storage of random long passwords - this little machine mimics a USB
keyboard.

Out of the box I am unable to use the Mooltipass device in dips VMs
based on whonix-ws-15 - why is that and how do I change it?

I just checked, and the whonix-ws-15 template out of the box has qubes-
usb-proxy installed - so missing that is not my problem.

Thanks for any hint.

Sincerely, Joh</description>

            <p>No, I’m not entirely new. And yes, I’m using the desktop applet for the attempted association - which works as advertised for fedora-31, as well as debian-10 based VMs, but not those based on whonix-ws-15.</p>
<p>Thanks for the <code>lsblk</code> hint - I will check that next.</p>

            <p>If you are new to Qubes, are you assigning this device to the DispVM with the sys-usb desktop applet? Does it work with other AppVMs based on different templates?</p>
<p>You can use the ‘lsblk’ command within the target VM to see what devices are present. Last case, assign the usb PCI devices to that DispVM for a direct connection.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
