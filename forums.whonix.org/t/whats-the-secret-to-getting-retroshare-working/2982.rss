    <description>I wanted to try to get RetroShare 0.6.1 working to test out with a friend. Following the instructions https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Chat#RetroShare I can easily install it, but getting it to connect is another issue altogether. It never gets DHT access even after leaving it running for days, so it appears I&#39;m offline. Are there special settings that one has to make to the Whonix Gateway or Workstation to get this functioning?</description>

            <p>The Retroshare instructions assume all communicating peers are running a similar setup with Tor. DHT connections to the larger network will be impossible because Tor does not support UDP.</p>
<p>To find other Tor users try sharing node keys on <a href="https://retroshare.rocks/">https://retroshare.rocks/</a></p>
