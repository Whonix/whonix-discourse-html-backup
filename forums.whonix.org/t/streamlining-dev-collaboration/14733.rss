    <title>Streamlining Dev Collaboration</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/streamlining-dev-collaboration/14733</link>
    <description># Overview

A few things have stood out to me that could be updated for simplifying collaboration between developers on the Whonix™ project. Namely, chat and git ops.

I have a few solutions that I would like to propose for these.

### Chat

Currently, most conversation happens on Discourse. Discourse is an awesome tool, but I notice during my troubleshooting conversations that the thread about CI work is clogged with lots of back and forth debugging chat. 

I have heard there is a telegram chat, but I do not use this service, and no longer have a smartphone connected to an SMS network. 

Modern software devs often use tools like Slack, Mattermost, and Microsoft Teams to collaborate, but I think adding new tools is a bit much

#### Proposed Solution:

We could easily implement the new Discourse chat plugin for conversations between devs, and perhaps a bit of lighthearted convo too, in case contributors want to get to know each other and build community :) 

https://blog.discourse.org/2022/08/discourse-chat-is-now-available-try-it-out-today/


### Git Workflows

Currently, we are using a few different Github repositories with various owners to make Whonix work. Phabricator seems to no longer be used, but Kanban boards would be awesome to help catalogue objectives and define milestones for the project. 

I think having a centralized project board on repositories would be a great way to help organize things.


#### Proposed Solution:

Move all source code to a Gitea instance (I am happy to maintain and have a domain registered). We can use their issues feature to define and prioritize work, and create project boards with clearly defined acceptance criteria as well as `Good Starter Issue` tags for new contributors.

We can use scripts to migrate issues from Phabricator to Gitea, and have all the relevant repositories on under one organization which @Patrick can be the admin. 


## Final Thoughts

I think Discourse is great, and that Discourse and Gitea could be the primary homes for Whonix moving forward. Discussion and work organization could be defined entirely in these two services, and could fill the void that services like Phabricator and Telegram were initially intended to address. 

Thank you for letting me speak my peace. Also, it should be mentioned that I am happy to implement all this work. The entire objective of my thoughts is to streamline development and community engagement, and not to overload devs that are already busy working on things.

<p>To me it is an issue of power. Power is consolidated to a few tech giants. Microsoft is making lots of moves on the AI front, and of course we all know how companies like Google and Amazon violate human’s right to privacy. As plutocratic governments merge with tech giants, humans are greatly in danger of slipping in to a deeply problematic Orwellian survellience state. I think any conversations about redistributing power is worth having. The principle may be more important than the convenience of using the super shiny low maintenance tools provided by these giants</p>

</aside>
<p>Ultimately, I am not sure the best solutions for anything. Just proposing ideas, I see all of your points as valid and making a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to build things to make your life easier so the project can move faster. I personally believe that issue tracking and project boards are very important. Of course we could simply leverage what github already has to offer, but ultimately having some sort of framework where people can jump in and contribute valuable things is important IMO.</p>
<p>Maybe I am too focused on the color of the bikeshed. But I want more people to be able use and contribute to our our bikeshed. That is a big upside of CI and automated testing IMO. Currently it seems like in many ways you are the person who helps make sure nothing breaks. In some ways, you are a dependency (I do not mean this offensively btw. It is a compliment to the great thing you have built ). But I want to reduce the reliance on you as a dependency so things can grow reliably for many years to come.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I am overthinking all of it, and I should just build more things and not worry about it.</p>

<p>Phabricator was a big surprise. I thought if facebook and wikimedia are using it for their issue tracking, the longevity of the project should be more or less guaranteed. Now Phabricator is a liability (since deprecated) and a lingering question what do with it. How to turn it into a static html archive and/or how to migrate the existing tickets elsewhere. Help would also be welcome to fully deprecated use of phabricator on <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a>.</p>
<p>Contributions, web apps are tricky in Open Source anyhow. First, TorBOX (previous project name) was hosted in the Tor Project wiki. Next it was hosted on sourceforge. Because that was also non-ideal, a webmaster contributor set up the domain <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> and a web server. The contributor after many years the contributor retired. Now I was left having to maintain both Whonix and its webserver. Linux distribution maintenance and server sysadmin skills are  quite different skills and not an automatic given that can be easily done on the side with no time effort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, started using this forum as issue tracker:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Issue_Tracker</a></p>
<p>Then we’re at least down to only 2 webapps. MediaWiki and discourse. That was my thinking.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<a href="http://github.com/adrelanos">github.com/adrelanos</a> - if you find Whonix to depend on it, and report that, then that’s a bug. That repo is supposed to be just a user mirror. Then it will be moved to <a href="http://github.com/Kicksecure">github.com/Kicksecure</a> or <a href="http://github.com/Whonix">github.com/Whonix</a>. These ones I am happy to fix quickly since easy to do and low time effort.</li>
<li>derivative-maker/derivative-maker: Yeah, that previous was Whonix/Whonix. I’ll just need a better name. Or just Whonix/derivative-maker? (Would be duplicated to Kicksecure/derivative-maker.) Also happy to get rid of the <a href="http://github.com/derivative-maker">github.com/derivative-maker</a> github org.</li>

<p>IMO higher level discussions should happen on the forum or in chat, but the heaviest collaboration and technical discussions should occur on issues using a remote git collab tool (github, gitlab, gitea, whatever)</p>
<p>Honestly I think a project board (cough cough gitea) would be more useful than chat at this point.</p>

</aside>
<p>I registered <a href="http://gitfoss.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gitfoss.org</a>. I would love to help host FOSS code there, but I don’t want to go through the effort of setting it up until people agree it is useful.</p>
<p>I do think it is useful, here is why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>currently, the gitflows for the whonix project leave a little to be desired. we have multiple accounts <code>adrenalos</code>, <code>whonix</code>, and <code>derivative-maker</code> for multiple parts of the project. A singular account would consolidate things and make it easier to gather info on the scope of the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kanban and issues could be set up. Phabricator is deprecated, but most modern software projects use project boards to implement features, catalogue issues, etc. This could help new users get engaged and pick up <code>good-first-issue</code> tickets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>privacy…I would love help creating a privacy policy/TOS on the site that legally prevents/discourages selling, brokering, or tracking data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are so many open source projects defaulting to microsoft as their primary place of working on code? Because it is the most feasible choice. Gitlab has an awful model that limits features for their free version</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Drawbacks to this IMO is what if one day I simply disappear and shut down the server? well IMO all the FOSS repos should be mirrored to both github and gitlab. The same argument could be proposed “what if microsoft decides to delete privacy software and free software that challenges the current heirarchy of power?”…well we would have to pick up the pieces</p>
<p>I want to build it. I can build it. And I <strong>will</strong> build it. But only if the community wants to come along for the ride. Cloud servers are a bit expensive, and home hosting isnt a great option for me for the next year or so. I am hoping to buy a house where I can get a business fiber connection, but that is a ways out. Ultimately, it will cost a bit of money.</p>
<p>So many amazing projects I would love to build a home for… whonix, graphene, or anyone else who wants to use FOSS tools to build FOSS tools.</p>

<p>Move all source code to a Gitea instance (I am happy to maintain and have a domain registered). We can use their issues feature to define and prioritize work, and create project boards with clearly defined acceptance criteria as well as <code>Good Starter Issue</code> tags for new contributors.</p>

This would be an interesting major addition to Whonix if there are enough resources to package it independently. I will open a ticket depending on feasibility.

  <p>Is it possible to use Discourse Chat with the stable version (not its default testes-passed) of discourse? I am currently getting an incompatible plugin error.  If it isn’t possible, is this functionality planned?</p>

            <p>My issue with telegram is that it requires a smartphone and telephone number. Maybe something like cwtch could be better?</p>
<p>I don’t mean to come in and be like “Lets change the tooling”, but it does seem like tools such as slack and discord are becoming more prevalent in dev teams for collaboration.</p>
<p>Honestly discourse itself without the chat plugin is likely fine. I just think a “chat room” of sorts could be a nice and easy way for people to communicate.</p>
<p>I really like Rocket.Chat too, but self hosting can be a PITA and add unnecessary tech debt.</p>
<p>I think leveraging existing discourse functionality is a good idea over adding new services, since it is such a sweet tool</p>
<p>I do think some kanban board work could really make it easier for people to jump in and collaborate <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>
<p>I also think a bit of work on the git workflows could be a good thing. I certainly am not doing this work for glory and fame, but it would be nice to see my authored commits on the repos I commit to :)…not a big deal just nice for the credibility thing when working with new clients, companies, etc <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=12" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:"></p>

<p>I looked into <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-chat-integration/66522">https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-chat-integration/66522</a> today. Installed it on the stage server.</p>
<p>(Primarily because I got interested in other notification features for new posts / replies. Those using channels other than e-mail.)</p>
<p>(“channels” being defines as: e-mail, telegram, browser notifications, …)</p>
<p>What’s the desired functionality for the discourse chat integration plugin? In the linked forum thread is a video. I watched it. Seems like the main functionality is that people can chat on some platform. Such as let’s say telegram for example. After a discussion has concluded, the transcript (one can choose a start and end point of the chat) can be forwarded as a new forum post here in discourse.</p>
<p>Is that the desired functionality you were looking for? Or just any chat based communication tool, not necessarily the discourse chat plugin (which isn’t really what I guessed what this plugin would do).</p>
<p>Not sure discourse has a “real” chat.</p>
<p>What happened to the user support chat:</p>

            <p>About chat protocols. Personally partial to IRC given the low usage requirements and simplicity of the protocol. Unfortunately the latter is also its weakens. Without a persistent connection you will lose chat history.</p>
<p>IRCv3 is an ‘official’ set of protocol extensions as specifications of which one might handle server-side retention and synchronisation of chat history but unfortunately without client and server support it still is not there yet.</p>

<a name="overview-1" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#overview-1"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>A few things have stood out to me that could be updated for simplifying collaboration between developers on the Whonix™ project. Namely, chat and git ops.</p>
<p>I have a few solutions that I would like to propose for these.</p>
<h3>
<a name="chat-2" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#chat-2"></a>Chat</h3>
<p>Currently, most conversation happens on Discourse. Discourse is an awesome tool, but I notice during my troubleshooting conversations that the thread about CI work is clogged with lots of back and forth debugging chat.</p>
<p>I have heard there is a telegram chat, but I do not use this service, and no longer have a smartphone connected to an SMS network.</p>
<p>Modern software devs often use tools like Slack, Mattermost, and Microsoft Teams to collaborate, but I think adding new tools is a bit much</p>
<h4>
<a name="proposed-solution-3" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#proposed-solution-3"></a>Proposed Solution:</h4>
<p>We could easily implement the new Discourse chat plugin for conversations between devs, and perhaps a bit of lighthearted convo too, in case contributors want to get to know each other and build community <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<a name="git-workflows-4" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#git-workflows-4"></a>Git Workflows</h3>
<p>Currently, we are using a few different Github repositories with various owners to make Whonix work. Phabricator seems to no longer be used, but Kanban boards would be awesome to help catalogue objectives and define milestones for the project.</p>
<p>I think having a centralized project board on repositories would be a great way to help organize things.</p>
<h4>
<a name="proposed-solution-5" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#proposed-solution-5"></a>Proposed Solution:</h4>
<p>Move all source code to a Gitea instance (I am happy to maintain and have a domain registered). We can use their issues feature to define and prioritize work, and create project boards with clearly defined acceptance criteria as well as <code>Good Starter Issue</code> tags for new contributors.</p>
<p>We can use scripts to migrate issues from Phabricator to Gitea, and have all the relevant repositories on under one organization which <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> can be the admin.</p>
<h2>
<a name="final-thoughts-6" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#final-thoughts-6"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think Discourse is great, and that Discourse and Gitea could be the primary homes for Whonix moving forward. Discussion and work organization could be defined entirely in these two services, and could fill the void that services like Phabricator and Telegram were initially intended to address.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me speak my peace. Also, it should be mentioned that I am happy to implement all this work. The entire objective of my thoughts is to streamline development and community engagement, and not to overload devs that are already busy working on things.</p>
