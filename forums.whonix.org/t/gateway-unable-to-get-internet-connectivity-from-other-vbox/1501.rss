    <title>Gateway Unable to Get Internet Connectivity from other VBOX?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/gateway-unable-to-get-internet-connectivity-from-other-vbox/1501</link>
    <description>Hi, 

I have followed all the instructions provided on the site and implemented best practices as suggested. 

I purchased a seperate USB wifi modem and have three VBOX running:

1. Ubuntu - Has USB WIFI attached to VM and directly connected to internet
2. Gateway
3. Workstation

I need the Gateway to use the internet from the Ubuntu VBOX. 
I want to keep the host totally compartmentalized (so I don&#39;t want to install the USB wifi on the host and then share it with the VBOX). Must stay separate. 

I am pulling my hair out trying to get this to work. I can find so little information on VBOX forums about getting this network sync going from Gateway to UBU Guess VBOX VMs. Please patrick .., or anyone help?</description>

            <p>Possible in theory as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a>. You would have to configure Whonix-Gateway eth0 as internal network in VirtualBox network settings. (Name it “internet” or so. Just don’t name it “Whonix”.) And edit /etc/network/interfaces accordingly (dhcp or static network, depending on the VM you are connecting to.) But this is unsupported.
