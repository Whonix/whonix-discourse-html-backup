    <title>Remove &quot;Something went wrong&quot; when using openvpn in the Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/remove-something-went-wrong-when-using-openvpn-in-the-workstation/7054</link>
    <description>0brand provided me with the following link: https://whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN

It lists steps required to use VPN from the Whonix Workstation.

I&#39;ve done all of these, but I still get the disturbing message that &quot;Something went wrong&quot; with the Tor browser.

Are there additional steps I need to take to get this to go away? Should I just uninstall the whole Tor extension?</description>

<p>Never do that. That will remove a lot of the anti-fingerprint protections.</p>
<p>The warning is normal to let you know you are not connecting thru Tor. They have no way to know that that IP is a VPN.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>rob</code></p>
<p>This is expected behavior. Nothing to worry about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is because Tor Browser can no longer access Tor’s ControlPort (<a href="http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Dev/CPFP" rel="nofollow noopener">onion-grater</a>) on Whonix-Gateway.</p>
