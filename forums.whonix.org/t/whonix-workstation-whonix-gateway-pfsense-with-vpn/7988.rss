    <description>Fellas, anybody can help me out? How to make this scheme works?

I wanna connect my whonix gateway into a pfsense gateway with VPN, like this:

Whonix workstation -&gt; Whonix Gateway -&gt; PfSense (With VPN)

All they into a VM. 

I&#39;ve changed the network on Whonix gateway to internal and selected pfsense but the problem is, my anon connection wizard on gateway get stuck on 85%.

Any idea?

Important to remember, the VPN is working fine on pfsense</description>

            <p>Hi <code>kongapipster</code></p>
<p>Brigdes are used to circumvent Tor cernsorship. Otherwise there is not much reason to use them, and certainly no reason to use both VPN <em>and</em>  bridges with Whonix / Tor. Its very possible this could be causing your connection issue. The increased tunnel length could be the issue here. (maybe in concert with a slow entry guard ).</p>
<p>A few thing you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove either the VPN or bridges (even temporarily for testing)</li>
<li>Use a VPN server closer to your location.</li>
<li>Try new bridges.</li>
<li>Temporarily rotating your entry guard

            <p>Important, instead of use NAT on my first NIC on virtuabox (Whonix gateway) I’m using “Internal network” and the internal network is connected with pfsense. With all others machines it’s works fine, I just have problem with tried to connect the whonix gateway.</p>

            <p>Hi <code>kongapipster</code></p>
<p>It would be helpful to see logs. Could you please post the full output of <code>whonixcheck</code></p>
<p>Are you using obfs4 Bridges? If so please redact the bridge IPs and fingerprints  from your output. Also could you please post the full output from this command.</p>

            <p>hey thanks for answer.</p>
<p>“What do you mean when you say the VPN works fine? Can you connect with non-Tor traffic? Can you connect to Tor without the VPN?”</p>
<p>Yes, VPN works fine when I use another machine and don’t try to use whonix so I don’t think the problem is with VPN.</p>
<p>Maybe if I could edit the Tor configuration on gateway or something like this.</p>
<p>On log I keep seeing “[Warn] Proxy client unable to connect to …”, I also see "You configured a non-loopback address … "</p>

            <p>Hi <code>kongahipster</code></p>
<p>Welcome to the Whonix forum.</p>
<p>What do you mean when you say the VPN works fine? Can you connect with non-Tor traffic? Can you connect to Tor without the VPN?</p>
<p>Could you run Whonix check from Whonix-Gatway and post the results.</p>
<p>In Whonix-Gateway terminal, run.</p>
<p><code>whonixcheck</code></p>
<p>Also see: <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Tor#Log_Analysis" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Tor#Log_Analysis</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that arbitrary increasing tunnel length can effect connectivity is some situations.</p>

            <p>Fellas, anybody can help me out? How to make this scheme works?</p>
<p>I wanna connect my whonix gateway into a pfsense gateway with VPN, like this:</p>
<p>Whonix workstation -&gt; Whonix Gateway -&gt; PfSense (With VPN)</p>
<p>All they into a VM.</p>
<p>I’ve changed the network on Whonix gateway to internal and selected pfsense but the problem is, my anon connection wizard on gateway get stuck on 85%.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Important to remember, the VPN is working fine on pfsense</p>
