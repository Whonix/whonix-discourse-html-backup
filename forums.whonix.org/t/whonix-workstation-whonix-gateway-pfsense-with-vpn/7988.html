          <p>Hi <code>kongahipster</code></p>
<p>Welcome to the Whonix forum.</p>
<p>What do you mean when you say the VPN works fine? Can you connect with non-Tor traffic? Can you connect to Tor without the VPN?</p>
<p>Could you run Whonix check from Whonix-Gatway and post the results.</p>
<p>In Whonix-Gateway terminal, run.</p>
<p><code>whonixcheck</code></p>
<p>Also see: <a href="../../../external.html?link=https://whonix.org/wiki/Tor#Log_Analysis" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Tor#Log_Analysis</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that arbitrary increasing tunnel length can effect connectivity is some situations.</p>

          <p>hey thanks for answer.</p>
<p>“What do you mean when you say the VPN works fine? Can you connect with non-Tor traffic? Can you connect to Tor without the VPN?”</p>
<p>Yes, VPN works fine when I use another machine and don’t try to use whonix so I don’t think the problem is with VPN.</p>
<p>Maybe if I could edit the Tor configuration on gateway or something like this.</p>
<p>On log I keep seeing “[Warn] Proxy client unable to connect to …”, I also see "You configured a non-loopback address … "</p>

          <p>Hi <code>kongapipster</code></p>
<p>Brigdes are used to circumvent Tor cernsorship. Otherwise there is not much reason to use them, and certainly no reason to use both VPN <em>and</em>  bridges with Whonix / Tor. Its very possible this could be causing your connection issue. The increased tunnel length could be the issue here. (maybe in concert with a slow entry guard ).</p>
<p>A few thing you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove either the VPN or bridges (even temporarily for testing)</li>
<li>Use a VPN server closer to your location.</li>
<li>Try new bridges.</li>
<li>Temporarily rotating your entry guard
