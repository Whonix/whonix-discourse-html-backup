    <title>VPNs and proxies known to work over Whonix Gateway? for User-Tor-VPN</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/vpns-and-proxies-known-to-work-over-whonix-gateway-for-user-tor-vpn/879</link>
    <description>I have used Windows, Ubuntu and Whonix Workstation with Gateway, and found that while free web vpns (kind you find in web search for &#39;free vpns&#39;) I tested do work on Whonix Workstation when set up via command line, I can&#39;t really get anything else to work, on any platform. Nothing connects. And I don&#39;t want to use those web vpns long term because I don&#39;t know how secure they are.

I&#39;ve tried AirVPN, Private Internet Access and CyberGhost to no avail. They didn&#39;t work with their default clients or over OpenVPN. I tried setting up PIA both via client and manually on my windows 7 vm and I still had no success connecting. Doing some research, my finding is that many or most vpns rely on more diverse protocols than Tor supports (only TCP vs UDP and others I&#39;ve never heard of before), which causes them to fail to connect. I don&#39;t really know what to try at this point or if it is even possible to use a normal VPN over Tor. I have read the literature you have on the site repeatedly and still am not sure what to do. I am at the limit of what I can do here.

[b]So, has anyone ever actually used a commercial, private VPN with or without client over Tor using Whonix? [/b] Please mention any/all services that work in your experience, if any. [b] If you&#39;ve used any of the three I mentioned, can you think of anything I may have done wrong or any error you had like mine that you got over? [/b] (my error is that they simply never connect) Preferably a VPN I can pay with using bitcoin. [b]Is there a way to get any of those three I mentioned to work on a TCP-only mode that Tor would play nice with?[/b]

My only other idea is to beg the vpn provider to make their product compatible with whonix/tor.

Thank you to anyone who replies in advance.</description>

            <p>i have used secureline vpn from avast anti-virus it was fast but its unsafe from the gov, and i have used many vpns but the problem is not witha vpns itself but with trusting in their providers what do i mean by this: if u r using vpn and u r trying to hide ur work or u dont like someone watching u doing it well:<br>
1-if u r hiding ur work from hackers most vpns provides security and they r truthful about it<br>
2-if u r hiding from the gov well this is the problem, u need to find a trustful vpn that doesnt give ur infos to the gov (which has no logs , no…etc)<br>
and there r some vpns saying that but the problem that u cant check if what they r saying is the truth except about trustiness with ur feelings or someone told u that it is really safe rather than that i didnt find a way that u can really know…</p>
<p>e.g of goods vpns i find it good for use: <a href="http://hide.me" rel="nofollow noopener">hide.me</a> , airvpn</p>
