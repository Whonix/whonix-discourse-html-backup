    <title>Consider reenabling host-vm clipboard copy paste</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/consider-reenabling-host-vm-clipboard-copy-paste/9142</link>
    <description>I know it has already been discussed somewhere.
But I would like to reopen the discussion concerning reenabling clipboard copy-paste between host and Whonix VMs (at least the Workstation).

**Pro:**
* Expected feature, users will want to copy-paste stuff into the Workstation (think passwords, logins, etc. stored in another machine for example).
* Can put first users off if they don&#39;t find this feature readily accessible
* Especially true for Whonix-Host ISO since the XML files have to be reedited on each boot, not convenient for quick live uses...
...

**Contra:**
* Security trumps user-friendliness in this one
* KVM is for advanced users anyway, they won&#39;t be scared away by a simple XML configuration change
* ...

Anything else?</description>

            <p>KVM user here, personally we would like this option not be enabled by default for security reasons.</p>
<p>Even if frustrated at first, we came to really to appreciate the fact that it is not there as it saved us from several mistakes.</p>

<p>We’ve asked upstream libvirt to implement a secure clipboard like Qubes’ so we can have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>I think having shared folders enabled by default should make this restriction less of a problem.</p>
<p>It would be a serious info breach to have an untrusted guest able to read stuff you do with your host clipboard or other VMs. Also not having it on, has saved me from a number of serious mistakes.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to point out that even default VMs (not Whonix) don’t enable it.</p>
