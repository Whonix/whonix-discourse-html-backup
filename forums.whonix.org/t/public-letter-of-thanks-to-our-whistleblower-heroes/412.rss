    <description>[html]&lt;p&gt;Independent news publisher ‘The Intercept’ that handles news stories based on Edward Snowden’s disclosures gives a hint of the existence of more than one Whistleblower who decided to step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/08/the_us_intellig.html&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by the renown cryptographer Bruce Schneier, who has access to the Snowden docuemnts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great news indeed and I, among many, would like to publicly thank these great people who have underwent immense risks and sacrifices to expose how our basic universal human rights are being violated. Thank you Snowden for your courage and initiative that inspired others to follow the same path of integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
