Sandboxing Tor Browser
The sandboxed Tor Browser
 cannot be used until **Whonix 14 i**s released. In the meantime, consider 
using Firejail as an interim sandboxing measure to restrict the Tor 
Browser process. 
Mitigating the risk of Tor Browser security breaches makes sense,
 because it is an untrusted application with a huge attack surface; it 
is frequently and successfully attacked in the wild.
Note: Consider cloning the Whonix-Workstation-TemplateVM prior to
 installing Firejail. Firejail installs a host of  dependencies and 
users may not want these in the default template.

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>The newest version of Firejail is 0.9.46, however, Debian’s repos currently only contain 0.9.40. Also, please regard this: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Firejail">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Firejail</a></p>

<p>MITM’s are a seperate thing all together only loosely (if at all) connected to your browser. They are soely a connection thing and are, thanks to Tor’s “onion design of encryption layers”, not really of concern as long as your connection goes through Tor and accesses a hidden service within the network. If the access is made to a “clearnet/non hidden service”, then the exit node can by the mere design of Tor listen in on your connection, if another encryption like proper TLS isn’t in use.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
