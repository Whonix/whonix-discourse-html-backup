    <title>Qubes 4.0.4 Whonix is not bootstrapping tor network</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/qubes-4-0-4-whonix-is-not-bootstrapping-tor-network/11677</link>
    <description>From the beginning of boot qubes 4.0.4, Qubes Whonix is not bootstrapping to Tor at all.
The [sys-whonix] Anon Connection Wizard is stuck at 45% phase: relaying tor connection and then time out, time is sane.

Is anything amiss here? Date and time are local to my area. In dom0 terminal Time zone is correct on my location. I tried to check by setting my hardware time according to UTC and it did not fix. Tor worked without issue after booting in older Qubes 3.2 on the same computers. I also checked whonix is working outside of qubes 4.0.4 in the same machine in windows when switching dual boot.</description>

</aside>
<p>Meaning <code>DisableNetwork 1</code> is still set. In other words, Tor still disabled.</p>
<p>Use anon-connection-wizard (ACW) only once. Or once more. And then leave it. Don’t use it over an over again. There’s really no use. There’s no magic.<br>
All it does is create file <code>/usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf</code> and restarts Tor.<br>
More details here:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#Unsuitable_Connectivity_Troubleshooting_Tools">Unsuitable Connectivity Troubleshooting Tools</a><br>
If it still doesn’t work, don’t re-use ACW. It won’t help.</p>
<p>If you don’t need bridges (if didn’t need in other VM), then a simpler way to enable Tor with just one line…</p>
<pre><code>sudo setup-dist-noninteractive 1
</code></pre>
<p>After that…</p>
<hr>
<pre><code>cat /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/40_tor_control_panel.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Expected output:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># Do not edit this file!
# Please add modifications to the following file instead:
# /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf
DisableNetwork 0
</code></pre>
<p>Then re-rerun <code>sudo anon-log</code>. It should no longer “DisableNetwork is set.”. It might show that but not after the latest restart (indicated by “[notice] Interrupt: exiting cleanly.”). Or should not show “DisableNetwork is set.” after reboot (just a shorter, easier to read Tor log).</p>
<p>If you reach this part…</p>

<p>That’s actually “progress”. That’s “only” a connection issue.<br>
But “Tor not running”, Tor disabled or failed Tor control connection are “worse” error conditions.</p>

<p>In that case, perhaps just wait longer. Then restart <code>systemcheck</code>. Tor might finish bootstrapping eventually.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I did not do anything extra. I just followed the troubleshooting instruction and tried to set time manually but it did not worked and then I uninstalled/removed whonix then reinstalled it again. The bootstrapping stuck problem still does not fix. The same problem and same error only inside whonix. But the tor browser is working fine outside whonix. I have installed tor browser bundle inside fedora qubes, It successfully bootstrapped in fedora qubes and using tor browser there separately. I need the whonix working in qubes 4.0.4. I guess the problem in whonix 15 only because I have tested whonix 14 in qubes 3.2 old version and it worked fine. Seems Whonix 15 in qubes has port/pid problem and for this connection is not bootstrapping at all. Is there any way in qubes os for soving problem via anydesk/teamviewer and would you help,please?</p>

            <p>Your system has an uncommon high number of different issues. Are you doing something special/extra such as changing Tor configuration?</p>

<p>Cannot both be an issue at the same time. The first is an issue of Tor starting at all. The second is an issue of Tor not being able to fully bootstrap.</p>
<p>The first issue of Tor not starting at all can likely be fixed with a proper installation of Qubes-Whonix as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Qubes/Install" class="inline-onebox">HowTo: Install the Stable Version of Qubes-Whonix ™ 15</a></p>
<p>The second issue I probably cannot help with. Tor being functional in another VM (Tor Browser) + Tor not able to connect in sys-whonix, breaking in the middle… Nothing that Whonix does should be capable of producing such issues.</p>

            <p>Hello, I tried all of the solutions listed on the troubleshooting page, but none of them worked. Whonix Tor doesn’t seem to be working at all. Anon Connection Wizard is stuck at 45% phase: Asking for relay descriptors.</p>
<p>Whonixcheck in syswhonix return ERROR: Tor Pid Check Result:<br>
Tor not running. (tor_pid_message: Pid file /run/tor/tor.pid does not exist.)</p>
<p>The clock source deafault is Xen in Whonix, fedora. In dom0 the default is Tsc. How to disable the clocksource Xen and switch to Tsc inside whonix.</p>
<pre><code>cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource 
xen tsc
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
xen
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to set the whonix clock manually by utc and randomized the clock. I also tried to set date time according utc in whonix gw15,ws15 and sys-whonix where I also set the hardware clock to utc. Nothing worked!!</p>
<p>Clearnet connectivity test has passed inside sys-whonix without tor network But failed in whonix gateway.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u clearnet UWT_DEV_PASSTHROUGH=1 curl --tlsv1.2 --proto =https -H 'Host: check.torproject.org' -k https://116.202.120.181
</code></pre>
<p>Tor browser is working and successfully bootstrapped in fedora qubes outside of whonix qubes. The only problem is bootstrapping and stuck at 45% only inside whonix qubes.</p>
<p>Antother Error is coming from whonixcheck this is it.<br>
ERROR: Tor Connection Result:<br>
Whonixcheck gave up waiting.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Connection 45 % done. Tor reports: NOTICE BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=45 TAG=requesting_descriptors SUMMARY=“Asking for relay descriptors”<br>
Possible issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the host’s internet connection working?</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway will need a few moments for bootstrapping the Tor network.</li>
<li>Do you live in a censored area?</li>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>From the beginning of boot qubes 4.0.4, Qubes Whonix is not bootstrapping to Tor at all.<br>
The [sys-whonix] Anon Connection Wizard is stuck at 45% phase: relaying tor connection and then time out, time is sane.</p>
<p>Is anything amiss here? Date and time are local to my area. In dom0 terminal Time zone is correct on my location. I tried to check by setting my hardware time according to UTC and it did not fix. Tor worked without issue after booting in older Qubes 3.2 on the same computers. I also checked whonix is working outside of qubes 4.0.4 in the same machine in windows when switching dual boot.</p>
