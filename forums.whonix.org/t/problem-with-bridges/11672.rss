    <description>hi dear members,

i use bridges with Whonix because Tor is blocked, and i can easily connect to Tor most of time. i choose obfs4 bridge option and no problem. however, whatever i try, it occasionally does not connect to Tor. when it happens, i restart again and again; it may barely connect. maybe 1/20. i have no idea what the issue is. at least not due to firewall.

this log is from sys-whonix time synchronisation monitor. it sometimes gives that kind of an output (providing &quot;a bridge i know&quot; doesn&#39;t help either):

[notice] Ignoring directory request, since no bridge nodes are available yet.
[notice] Ignoring directory request, since no bridge nodes are available yet.
[notice] New control connection opened.
[notice] New control connection opened.
...

and it sometimes gives that kind of an output:

[warn] Proxy Client: unable to connect OR connection (handshaking (proxy)) with 109.105.109.147:13764 ID=tqkUpY5NwlK1cMA8bJ1pqtKv4nLgp8144wMF/Tpem9A RSA_ID=BBB28DF0F201E706BE564EFE690FE9577DD8386D (&quot;general SOCKS server failure&quot;)

can someone help me? should i wait? because this happens once in a while for a few days, but then fixes itself unless i do fix it unintentionally.</description>
