    <description>Who&#39;s Going to 31c3 this month in Hamburg, Germany?

Are any of the Whonix people attending the 31c3? Especially the German Whonix people (Patrick et al)?

Lots of familiar friendly faces are going to be there... Tor people, Qubes people, and more.

I will be attending as well (australian linux dev and whonix user). Hope to see you Whonix guys/gals there!

&lt;blockquote&gt;All orders in the on-line ticket sale need to be paid till December 20th, 2014. If you know in advance that SEPA transfer will not make it in time, better pay via credit card or buy a ticket on premise.

The on-line ticket sale will end on December 12th at 23:59:59 CET.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 31st Chaos Communication Congress (31C3) is an annual four-day conference on technology, society and utopia. The Congress offers lectures and workshops and various events on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to) information technology and generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology and the discussion about the effects of technological advances on society.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            <p>Cause now i understand your Words Patrick. But it’s not my Opinion to do. It’s only Yours and Dennis are. Of cause, we have thee White Paper Accident of source, so we can really discuss when you want about this. Strictly we stay away from Dennis Guy who makes here the way it isn’t. I stay on Germany long time before (Wiesbaden Hessen) and we know where CCC isn’t[it] is… So, when you need Money, we can give us to you too. Please handle as free to contact us. So, it seems that you have some Money Problems to go forward.</p>

</aside>
<p>Germany. Depends on the definition of “free”. As long as you do not shed light upon law violations by big banks as for example Gustl Mollath, “the system” doesn’t imprison you illegally into a closed psychiatric ward. Also as long you stay away from doing, saying political relevant stuff the media won’t discredit you and they won’t incarcerate you. But well, that goes for any “free” country, no? <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Yeah, well, maybe it’s still better than in other countries but then again, it’s hard to build an opinion out of a few contemporary witness and media. So I am not sure about that.</p>

<p>Sure. Wasn’t the topic to urge me not to go there. No problem here.</p>
<blockquote>I and my Group met the CCC at his early Days. What we see there is pure facism.</blockquote>
Citation required. Otherwise I am unsure you're talking about another institution called "ccc".
<blockquote>Another point to quit with this Organisation was, they piss on poor people.</blockquote>
Same as above.
<blockquote>The CCC hisself is a big Group of rich Boys and Girls from rich Parents, who talk a lot but do nothing itselfs.</blockquote>
Same as above.
<blockquote>He copy other Developments and talk and talk and talk...</blockquote>
Sounds like Open Source? The same way you could accuse Whonix from being based on Debian. Without their development, Whonix wouldn't exist in its current form. But they don't mind at all. That's the spirit of the Libre Software community.
<blockquote>After a while they start working with the German Goverment and German Industry.</blockquote>
I'd rather say, CCC is an annoyance to German Government. They continuously complain about electoral computers:
http://www.ccc.de/de/tags/wahlcomputer
<p>They released and analyzed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse" data-bbcode="true">trojan horse</a> software used by the German government (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online-Durchsuchung_%28Deutschland%29" data-bbcode="true">Bundestrojaner</a>):<br>
<a href="http://ccc.de/de/updates/2011/staatstrojaner" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://ccc.de/de/updates/2011/staatstrojaner</a></p>
<p>As one result that was based on their work, the German Federal “Constitutional” Court restricted use of that software with a court ruling. This was (seemingly?) a bitchslap for legislative and executive branch.</p>
<p>I am not a defender of CCC. But what I’ve learned in past, they work has been government critical. Haven’t seen evidence them doing anything immoral yet. But I am open for the evidence. If you have any evidence, that CCC does immoral things, I would be delighted to check and eventually update my world view.</p>
<blockquote>Probaly i think when CCC joins the Whonix Organisation you will lost a lot of Friends here.</blockquote>
Looks like a misunderstanding. CCC is the organizer of a yearly event. (Chaos Communication Congress) Speeches, and discussion, etc. I guess members of ccc will be a small minority during the event. People from Tor, Tails, Qubes, LEAP, accessnow, EFS, FSF and many more will attend. (See https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Assembly:Noisy_Square and other event wiki pages.) As far I know, none of them is considering to join CCC. Me included. If I don't attend, no one from CCC would care. Not even e-mail me.

            <p>Dear Adrelanos. First you live in a (free?) Country. You can do what you want. I and my Group met the CCC at his early Days. What we see there is pure facism. Another point to quit with this Organisation was, they piss on poor people. When we see that, it gaves no return. The CCC hisself is a big Group of rich Boys and Girls from rich Parents, who talk a lot but do nothing itselfs. He copy other Developments and talk and talk and talk… so we must quit. After a while they start working with the German Goverment and German Industry. So very ugly - no way! Probaly i think when CCC joins the Whonix Organisation you will lost a lot of Friends here. Only my Opinion.</p>
