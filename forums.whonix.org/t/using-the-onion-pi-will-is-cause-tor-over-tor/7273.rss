    <title>Using the Onion Pi - will is cause tor over tor?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-the-onion-pi-will-is-cause-tor-over-tor/7273</link>
    <description>Would using something like the onion pi cause a tor over tor situation As far as I can tell, it creates a regular wifi access point, but that access point resides on top of tor. Then all traffic is routed through tor. 

Here is a link to adafruit, company that makes raspberry pi devices on the onion pi setup (https://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/overview)

Im wanting to use something like this in my home setup for more security, but want to avoid tor over tor</description>
