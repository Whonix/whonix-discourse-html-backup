This really needs a rewrite. A lot of the points are just completely inaccurate.

Windows:

The forced updates/upgrades are hardly &quot;backdoors&quot;. Would you rather have millions of people forget to update and their computers become seriously insecure? This is how botnets are formed.

&gt; When Microsoft realized it had accidentally allowed GNU/Linux to be installed on RT tablets, it quickly [&quot;fixed the error&quot;](https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2016/07/15/microsoft-silently-kills-dev-backdoor-boots-linux-locked-windows-rt-slabs/) [[archive]](https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.securitynewspaper.com/2016/07/15/microsoft-silently-kills-dev-backdoor-boots-linux-locked-windows-rt-slabs/) to prevent the use of other operating systems.

This is good as a joke. Nothing else. This was a real vulnerability that bypassed verified boot. Would you call our verified boot attempts backdoors too?

Sure, I agree it should have a way to unlock the bootloader but calling it a backdoor is just plain wrong.

&gt; Windows Insecurity

You criticize the security of Windows, yet recommend Debian which is years behind Windows in security. Where&#39;s modern mitigations like Control-Flow Integrity in Debian? Since Windows has had it since 2015 as Control Flow Guard.

&gt; Windows is a pile of legacy code full of security holes that is easily compromised.

Linux is known for keeping legacy code around and the standard Linux distro is far easier to totally compromise than Windows (just keylog the sudo password and load a kernel module, not even exploiting a bug required).

Your only citations for the MD5/SHA-1 stuff is for Windows 7 Server 2008.

Criticize Windows for it&#39;s actual issues like privacy, not this.

Other:

Using FSF/GNU as a source is also terrible. They call any vulnerability in proprietary software a &quot;backdoor&quot; with 0 evidence.

&gt; A Free Software OS that respects user freedom is the only practical choice when it comes to privacy and security.

Being free software makes no difference to its security. Linux is a perfect example of a free software project that has terrible security.

We really shouldn&#39;t be recommending Debian throughout the wiki either. At least recommend Kicksecure.

Don&#39;t peddle the same misinformation that Linux is totally secure and glorious. It&#39;s far from it hence why we have to do so much work in Whonix.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of anti-debugging is to hinder the process of reverse engineering. There could be several general approaches: (1) to detect the existence of a debugger, and behave differently when a debugger is attached to the current process; (2) to disrupt or crash a debugger. Approach (1) is the mostly frequently applied (see an excellent survey in [<a href="http://www.shell-storm.org/papers/files/764.pdf">2</a>]). Approach (2) is rare (it targets and attacks a debugger - and we will see several examples in Max++ later). Today, we concentrate on Approach (1).</p>

<p>My real recommendations would be ChromeOS (+ Android apps) and Windows 10 S for most people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traditional Linux distributions aren’t very secure overall, and the Linux desktop stack is a disaster without any semblance of an application security model. There’s ongoing work to address this problems but it’s barely started and it will be a long and painful process. Windows and OS X have similar issues to address, but Microsoft is the furthest along in tackling the issues and takes it the most seriously. Non-mobile security as a whole is awful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Windows has good exploit mitigations. They’ve been the leaders in this area among mainstream operating systems. Windows security is still a disaster on the desktop due to the legacy security model without Windows 10 S and that’s a painful sacrifice to make. Windows 10 S also isn’t really on par with Android and iOS yet but it’s most of the way there.</p>

</aside>
<p>Quotes from the Microsoft website alone are already admitting enough to make this a clear decision for me. If there was such an analysis, it would be interesting to look at it.</p>
<p>Also install root TLS certificate won’t work. Quote <a href="https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/publications/2019/06/11/dpia-windows-10-enterprise-v.1809-and-preview-v.-1903/DPIA+Windows+10+version+1.5+11+June+2019.pdf">https://www.government.nl/binaries/government/documents/publications/2019/06/11/dpia-windows-10-enterprise-v.1809-and-preview-v.-1903/DPIA+Windows+10+version+1.5+11+June+2019.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has encrypted the network traffic and has implemented certificate pinning<br>
as a regular security measure against unauthorised access. However, the specific<br>
way in which Microsoft has implemented the certificate pinning, also prevents a<br>
trusted network proxy from inspecting the data, i.e., the use of a man in the middle<br>
proxy. That is why BSI used the debugger tool. The use of this method results in a<br>
view of the telemetry data that is similar to the Diagnostic Data Viewer provided by<br>
Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a related interesting consideration: Then also some malware behaves different if run inside a a VM or detects a debugger. I am not saying Windows is currently doing that, but it could in theory. Therefore the concepts Open Source, Reproducible Builds and in-toto transport for apt are the future, the way to go.</p>
<p>But also such a traffic analysis should already exist since…?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Windows is reverse engineered often for various reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then such an analysis would age quite rapidly too… Also quoted from the same PDF as above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BSI writes that Microsoft is retrieving and updating the configuration telemetry data several times<br>
per hour. 44</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, the collection of telemetry data is highly dynamic. Microsoft engineers can add new types of events to the telemetry stream without prior notice to the users, if they follow internal privacy procedures.47 According to the BSI research quoted in paragraph 2.2 the configuration of the telemetry data flow is modified several times<br>
per hour. Each modification can mean that a new ETW provider wants access to<br>
data, or an existing ETW provider wants access to other log data.<br>
Microsoft engineers explain the importance of the dynamic nature of creating<br>
telemetry events as follows: “In data-driven environments, such instrumentation is<br>
moving towards rule-based approaches, where instrumentation can be added once<br>
and then toggled without having to change the code itself. This functionality has<br>
enabled data-driven organizations to collect data not just during testing, but long<br>
after the product is deployed into retail. As Austindev remarks, “What’s really great<br>
for us is to be able to real-time turn on and off what log stuff you’re collecting at a<br>
pretty granular level. And to be able to get the performance back when it is turned<br>
off is a big thing for us.”<br>
48<br>
Microsoft has explained to the Dutch DPA in 2017 that the collection of telemetry<br>
data in Windows 10 is controlled by organisational policy rules. There is no reason to<br>
assume that such policy rules would not apply to the collection of telemetry data<br>
from Windows 10 Enterprise. However, Microsoft does not provide any information<br>
about this policy, nor any audit results with regard to compliance with those policy<br>
rules. The limitations to these audits are described in section 5 of this report,<br>
‘Controller, processor and sub-processors’.</p>

<p>Except it’s not actually enabled by default. Users are asked upon startup if they wish for it to be enabled.</p>
<p>The methodologies used to verify if telemetry is disabled in the other sources you link are dubious. Simply measuring the amount of connections a piece of software makes proves nothing. There is no proof those connections are transmitting anything privacy-sensitive. whonixcheck and sdwdate both connect to various servers but does that make it telemetry? Of course not. If you really want to analyse the telemetry, install a root TLS certificate and examine exactly what is being sent.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debug_symbol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Debug symbol</a></h3>

<p>
A debug symbol is a special kind of symbol that attaches additional information to the symbol table of an object file, such as a shared library or an executable. This information allows a symbolic debugger to gain access to information from the source code of the binary, such as the names of identifiers, including variables and routines. 
 The symbolic information may be compiled together with the module's binary file, or distributed in a separate file, or simply discarded during the compilation...</p>

<p>Debug symbols are usually not in production builds. However, microsoft forgot to remove debug symbols. That’s why textual string “nsakey” was found inside Windows: unstripped debug symbols in production build</p>
<p>Quote from the original which started the speculation:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000617163417/http://www.cryptonym.com/hottopics/msft-nsa/msft-nsa.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20000617163417/http://www.cryptonym.com/hottopics/msft-nsa/msft-nsa.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note 1: many people have written us and assumed that we “reverse engineered” Microsoft’s code. This is not true; we did not reverse engineer Microsoft code at any time. In fact, the debugging symbols were found using standard Microsoft-purchased programmer’s tools, completely by accident, when debugging one of our own programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Microsoft didn’t forget to strip debug symbols in production build, then textual string “nsakey” would be nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>If you point out any duplication, I’ll try to reduce. However, some things are duplicated because without re-mentioning the conclusion chapters couldn’t be reasonably argued.

<p>It’s a very complicated thing, especially when talking about Qubes which is drastically different from traditional operating systems. The security of Qubes also heavily depends on how it’s being used. Virtualization won’t save you if you put all of your personal data into a single VM that gets persistently compromised. Threat models and user behaviour are critical in recommending a secure OS to someone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right. There’s a lot to analyze, document. I’ll work on that once a standalone release of <code>kicksecure.org</code> and Kicksecure is done.</p>

1) trustworthiness/auditability
2) customization freedom</div>

<p>You can’t boil this down into such a simple conclusion. It’s a very complicated thing, especially when talking about Qubes which is drastically different from traditional operating systems. The security of Qubes also heavily depends on how it’s being used. Virtualization won’t save you if you put all of your personal data into a single VM that gets persistently compromised. Threat models and user behaviour are critical in recommending a secure OS to someone.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Windows is certainly more secure than Qubes, just that it’s difficult to quantify security in such a way.</p>

            <p>(Non-technical comment, so take with a grain of salt)</p>
<p>I agree that page is super messy. A logical approach would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>split into separate pages Windows v macOS v other</li>
<li>clearly demarcate privacy and security issues on those child pages (yes, they’re related I know, but it’s too messy right now)</li>
<li>add the main missing element - Xen and like systems with Type I hypervisors &amp; virtualized, separated domains for various elements - networking, firewalls, USB, GUIVM, ‘dangerous applications’ etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m pretty sure security professionals were saying in recent times that all monolithic OSes are clusterf**ks for security. Too much code, massive kernels running with 10s of millions of lines of code etc. means they can never be properly secured (until maybe we have quantum computer fuzzing operations or similar doing tests in massive paralell i.e. something with 300 qubits or so).</p>
<p>So, we must assume in advance all systems will be pwned by any competent adversary. That suggests fine-grained separation is the only solution, preferably with those VM instances running in minimal templates, all in a disposable fashion i.e. Qubes architecture.</p>
<p>I think it’s hard to argue that Windows 10, even with 10s of thousands of developers and billions of dollars of investment/man hours, is more secure than say Xen hypervisor with disposable netVM, disposable firewall-VM, disposable USB-VM, GUIVM, all applications run in minimised disposableVMs for single use purposes etc.</p>
<p>Maybe those Qubes VMs can be pwned at a rate of 2-3 times (say) a Windows instance, but who gives a shit if the minute I shut down the disposable VM the miscreant’s presence is killed? If they are performing VM breakouts and infecting dom0, then you’ve bigger things to worry about, because that is apparently not trivial.</p>
<p>I also wonder what OS the NSA and others run BTW? I searched for that in the past and couldn’t see any clear answers. Pretty sure they’re not running Windows 10.</p>
<p>Even if Windows 10 is far more secure in its architecture than your best Linux OS today, I don’t think our community cares i.e. they want privacy and not 100s of open channels to the Microsoft mothership that can never be turned off despite all best efforts.</p>
<p>An honest appraisal at the end of the day might say - yes, Windows 10 is far more secure than your stock standard Linux OS as madaidan points out, but a privacy disaster. On the other hand, none of the monolithic OSes come near Type I hypervisor arrangements. So, I’d suggest that Qubes-Whonix is then the best compromise under the circumstances. Reasonably secure, privacy-focused, and can limit the long term impact of breaches by malicious turds when properly configured with a bit of effort.</p>

</aside>
<p>I assume the key is used to indicate that the NSA has reviewed the cryptography and determined that it is fully compliant with the law. The key itself is not a legal requirement — it’s used to indicate that the actual requirements have been met. The US used to have really tight restrictions on cryptography (they have since been relaxed).</p>

<p>Export of cryptographic technology and devices from the United States was severely restricted by U.S. law until 1992. The law gradually became eased until around 2000, but some restrictions still remain today.
 Since World War II, many governments, including the U.S. and its NATO allies, have regulated the export of cryptography for national security reasons, and, as late as 1992, cryptography was on the U.S. Munitions List as an Auxiliary Military Equipment.

<p>Ready.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You mean you want me to bring up some points?</p>
<p>First off, you have far too many subsections and not everything is relevant to security or privacy such as the nuisances part. There are also many parts that are duplicated and it’s just a huge wall of misleading text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft has a history of informing adversaries of bugs before they are fixed. Microsoft reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gives adversaries security tips</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[archive]</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/PdLBZ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">archive.is</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://archive.is/PdLBZ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[archive]</a>) on how to crack into Windows computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s willingness to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130614/02110223467/microsoft-said-to-give-zero-day-exploits-to-us-government-before-it-patches-them.shtml" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">consult with adversaries and provide zero days</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130614/02110223467/microsoft-said-to-give-zero-day-exploits-to-us-government-before-it-patches-them.shtml" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">[archive]</a> before public fixes are announced logically places Windows users at greater risk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(That’s duplicated, by the way)</p>
<p>I have gone over this before. They are not providing adversaries with zero days — they are giving a variety of organisations early access to embargoed security patches so they can ship them out immediately after public disclosure. Linux does the exact same thing and this isn’t a major issue: <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The crucial difference between Microsoft bug embargoes and Linux bug embargoes is that Microsoft notifies intelligence agencies which are then known to exploit vulnerabilities while the Linux kernel security team has a much more transparent bug embargo process where trusted parties, huge Linux distributions receive an early notification for the purpose of wide availability of the software upgrade containing the fix before to prevent wide exploitation by attackers in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it’s just naive to assume intelligence agencies aren’t getting these notifications. The NSA doesn’t even need these since Linux is so trivial to exploit anyway which brings me on to the next point…</p>
<p>All the claims on “Windows Insecurity” are simply nonsensical. Microsoft have made enormous strides on security and is decades ahead of Linux: <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html</a></p>
<p>Any credible security researcher will tell you the same thing: <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#security-researcher-views" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#security-researcher-views</a></p>
<p>And no, source models aren’t magic security properties.</p>

<p>I suggest this needs to be split into small chunks. Because if it’s too many points at the same time, it quickly gets messy, overwhelming.</p>
<p>Please bring up one small point. (Or I will soon bring up one small point and ask for clarification.) Then stick to that point until that’s resolved. And meanwhile that point is being discussed, don’t bring up other stuff. One point such as “this and this is a Windows backdoor or not”. If it’s not possible in this forum thread, use a separate one and make the on-topic very clear. I’d then try to moderate as restrictive as possible and move any posts too broad back to this one.</p>
<p>Not sure when we start this modus of operation. In separate forum topic, post any time.</p>

<p>In other situations I also often very much understand the usefulness of sometimes to make a “summary answer”. If too many people bring up too many things, not everything can get answered. Cannot discuss with everyone until consensus is found or giving up due to fatigue. Similar for long articles / wiki pages where one feels that just too much is wrong to go into everything in detail. However, in this case, in improvements should be made, I very much suggest to split into small chunks, keeping working on it continued. It’s not that many bullet points in total.</p>

</aside>
<p>I disagree with Bruce Schneier from 1999 too. But I don’t think it’s realistic to contact him for discussion on that one. Too bad that’s not one of his articles with comments enabled (was a newsletter, perhaps before the blog that supports comments was introduced, dunno).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, why in the world would anyone call a secret NSA key “NSAKEY”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You tell me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of people have access to source code within Microsoft;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why assume it’s in the source code that relevant developers work on (or nowadays in the version shared through the shared source program)? It was found in forgotten to remove debugging symbols only.</p>
<p>The source code most developers work with could be clean. A backdoor might only be introduced during compilation, which is most likely done on a different machine, a build machine.</p>
<p>Access to Microsoft source code is most likely not a all or nothing situation. Not every developer working on let’s say Skype or Edge don’t necessarily always has access to all source code of other components of let’s say kernel, crypto all the time. Compartmentalization is clever to avoid leaks.</p>
<p>Therefore even if Microsoft had at some point 47000 developers or so (dunno how many it where in 1999), doesn’t mean all of them would have access to that part of the source code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone with a debugger could have found this “NSAKEY.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The public: An independent security researcher was only able to find it since Microsoft forgot to remove debugging symbols. This mistake was probably fixed by Microsoft nowadays.</li>
<li>A Microsoft developer:
<ul>
<li>Most Microsoft developers would be provided, and work with the clean source code, without any backdoors. If they created a build including debug symbols, “NSAKEY.” would not have been included.</li>
<li>Even if a Microsoft developer found “NSAKEY” and they asked the management about it, the management could just say “that’s alright” or some other explanation. The developer might not be suspicious. Even if suspicious, it is unreasonable to assume every developer becoming a whisteblowser, risk their current employment, income, legal action and further employment opportunities. Anonymous whisteblowing wouldn’t be worth it without evidence / source code. Then it would be a minor note and disregarded as FUD. Any if leaked including source code / further evidence, then the number of suspects who could have leaked it would be tiny.</li>
<li>“NSAKEY.” could have been inserted by a much smaller group of developers at a later stage (before building / on the build machine).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Don’t assume the perfect crime. Humans make mistakes.</p>
<p>What might have really happened:</p>
<p>Quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Notes#Security">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Notes#Security</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1997, Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed export of a version that supported stronger keys with 64 bits, but 24 of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a “workload reduction factor” for the NSA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even then Microsoft isn’t forthcoming about it.</p>

            <p>Clarified the point on open development.</p>
<p>(Need to use code tags as the forum eats <code>&lt;rev&gt;</code> tags.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">There is no public issue tracker for Microsoft Windows where any reasonable user is allowed to post or reply. There is a public [https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability list of vulnerabilities] but without public discussion among developers and/or users. &lt;ref&gt;
https://answers.microsoft.com is mostly(?) user-to-user discussion. Mostly: hard to find any employees posting there or very low interaction. [https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/page/faq#faqWhosWho1 A volunteer moderator isn't a developer.]

There is also https://techcommunity.microsoft.com.
&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's internal issue tracker is private, unavailable for the public even for reading. &lt;ref&gt;
Link as evidence pointing to the fact that Microsoft does have an internal issue tracker: https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-17-microsoft-bug-database-hacked-in-2013.html
&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of the public of getting insights into the planning, thought process of Microsoft, participation in the development of Windows is much more limited. This is the case for many closed source, proprietary software projects. The community cannot participate as much in development. In comparison for Open Source projects, issue tracker are most often public for everyone to post and reply (with exception of security issues under embargo until fixed).

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s how closed source software works in general. The community can’t participate as much in development.</p>
<p>Also, I’ve noticed that you have continued to add misleading parts to the page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By comparison, also other operating systems, even Whonix and Kicksecure source code contain the string snippet <code>nsa</code>. For example in package security-misc file <code>/usr/lib/security-misc/pam_tally2-info</code> contains string <code>xscreensaver has its own failed login counter.</code> The word <code>xscreensaver</code> contains <code>xscreensaver</code> that however is an absurd comparison. Things have to be compared in proper context. Whonix and Kicksecure source code there is no variable, function or symbol name with any meaning containing “nsa”. Words such as <code>unsave</code> have nothing to do with it. This can be confirmed by auditing the related parts of the source code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a more fair comparision then: <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=nsa" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/torvalds/linux/search?q=nsa</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>NSA_DEV</code></li>
<li><code>pass_NSA</code></li>
<li><code>RX_ENABLE_NSA</code></li>
<li><code>nsa_mode</code></li>
</ul>
<p>“These are quite clearly commands to enable the NSA Linux kernel backdoor to steal user passwords.”</p>
<p>There is no evidence to say that <code>_NSAKEY</code> even stood for the “National Security Agency”. There is no expansion of the acronym or a space between “NSA” and “KEY”. You’d have a stronger argument with the examples I listed above because there are spaces between them and the National Security Agency actually do have a history of contributing to the Linux kernel — you don’t do this though because it is absurd, just like with <code>_NSAKEY</code>.</p>
<p>A <em>much</em> more likely explanation for the naming is: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121024225124/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/1999/sept99/rsapr.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://web.archive.org/web/20121024225124/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/1999/sept99/rsapr.aspx</a></p>

<p>There is no public issue tracker for Microsoft Windows. In comparison for Open Source projects, issue tracker are most often public for everyone (with exception of security issues under embargo until fixed).</p>

<p>A wide variety of malware types exist, including computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, rogue software, wiper and scareware.</p>

<p>If that definition is accepted… It therefore follows, if one agrees that “Windows is Spyware”, it then logically follows “Windows is also Malware”. This is to explain the GNU Project opinion of calling Windows “Malware”.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To make this less of a daunting task… That ends up in the backlog not being worked on… Since this is one of the most controversial technical discussions here ever…</p>
<p>I suggest this needs to be split into small chunks. Because if it’s too many points at the same time, it quickly gets messy, overwhelming.</p>
<p>Please bring up one small point. (Or I will soon bring up one small point and ask for clarification.) Then stick to that point until that’s resolved. And meanwhile that point is being discussed, don’t bring up other stuff. One point such as “this and this is a Windows backdoor or not”. If it’s not possible in this forum thread, use a separate one and make the on-topic very clear. I’d then try to moderate as restrictive as possible and move any posts too broad back to this one.</p>
<p>Not sure when we start this modus of operation. In separate forum topic, post any time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you could also have patience with me for a week or so. It’s “just” 63 posts for now. I am going to re-read all. And then, I’ll be attempting to integrate your criticisms and answer them right on the same wiki page.</p>
<p>In other situations I also often very much understand the usefulness of sometimes to make a “summary answer”. If too many people bring up too many things, not everything can get answered. Cannot discuss with everyone until consensus is found or giving up due to fatigue. Similar for long articles / wiki pages where one feels that just too much is wrong to go into everything in detail. However, in this case, in improvements should be made, I very much suggest to split into small chunks, keeping working on it continued. It’s not that many bullet points in total.</p>

<p>It would be a net benefit for the knowledge of the world if this information was documented somewhere. But not on <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a>. Too time consuming and too far off-topic from the goals of Whonix project to get involved deeply involved into creating a perfect comparison table or write-up on that subject. Wikipedia might be interested to host this information or any other more general knowledge wiki / comparison site. I would certainly a minimum be a reader. Probably also add a link to it from Whonix wiki. Having this information well laid out could help to get these issues fixed. Without awareness of the issue it’s even less likely of getting fixed.</p>

<p>I’m not clinging to that. I don’t really have much of an issue with the title.</p>
<p>Just look at the comparison table. It’s wrong to pretend that the full system MAC policy in Android and Kicksecure are similar. SELinux is ingrained into Android’s architecture and the entire ecosystem was shaped around it. Additionally, SELinux allows for far more restrictive policies (e.g. ioctl filtering or even just stricter permissions for files) than apparmor.</p>
<p>We’re slapping an apparmor policy on top of an OS that it wasn’t intended for. While this is good and we can make some great progress with it, it’ll never be as good as a strict policy on top of an OS that was <em>designed</em> for it.</p>
<p>Another example is the hardened kernel row. Our hardened-kernel is nice but it’s not the same as Android. Android kernels contain a lot of hardening patches including fine-grained forward-edge Clang Control-Flow Integrity and ShadowCallStack to prevent code reuse attacks (CFI/SCS is only on Pixels &gt;=3 though). CFI isn’t in mainline or linux-hardened and won’t be for a long time. ShadowCallStack isn’t even possible on x86 due to the way it handles returns.</p>
<p>Although, I’m looking more into Android/Qualcomm’s hardening patches and might submit some to linux-hardened (I’ve been talking to Daniel Micay about this on Matrix).</p>
<p>The comparison table is also neglecting to mention all the advantages of Android over Kicksecure. One example is that Android has the majority of the system written in memory safe languages (Java). Another example is that Android/iPhone has modern user space exploit mitigations like CFI/PAC.</p>
<p>This subject is too complex to be a simple Yes/No comparison table which is why I removed it and expanded a bit below it. What I meant by “Security is not just a checklist of features” is that the implementation matters. Not the general topic. Sure, you can have a “sandbox” but that doesn’t mean it’ll actually restrict anything meaningful for example.</p>

<p>Interesting. Added.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think it should mention mitigations specifically since it’s not just mitigations vendors introduce. They add tons of bloatware that contain their own security vulnerabilities. I’ve found Samsung to be particularly egregious in this regard although sane vendors like Google are usually fine.</p>

<p>Security is not just a checklist of features.</p>

<p>Agreed. Who build the security and for what purpose. Benefit of user or maximizing profit at expense of privacy and security from vendor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure’s sandboxing/MAC/verified boot/etc. isn’t even near iPhone/Android and there are numerous security enhancements in phones such as modern exploit mitigations or widespread memory safe languages that are not achievable with Kicksecure.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s besides the point. Please don’t cling on a single phrase “Level Security” and then view everything through that lens. That chapter has to be viewed in a bigger context.</p>
<p>The headline <code>iPhone and Android Level Security for Linux Desktop Distributions</code> is also bad for other more pragmatic reasons. Through conversations I’ve learned that many people know about how bad many phones/mobile apps are in their default configuration for privacy they equate this with security, and then intuitively discard the idea that iPhone / Android have any worthwhile security features worth porting to Linux desktop. I.e. even if <code>iPhone and Android Level Security for Linux Desktop Distributions</code> was fully possible in theory and even if madaidan would agree, it would still be bad self-representation of the project. Will change chapter title to <code>Kicksecure Development Goals</code>.</p>
