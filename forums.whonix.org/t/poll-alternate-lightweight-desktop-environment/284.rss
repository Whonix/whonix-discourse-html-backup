    <title>POLL: Alternate lightweight desktop environment</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/poll-alternate-lightweight-desktop-environment/284</link>
    <description>As a long time user of Whonix and an advocate for free-speech and privacy I have decided it was time that I gave back to the community. For the foreseeable future I will have quite a lot of free time and have decided that I will spend this new-found free time by helping with the development of Whonix.

For my first major contribution I would like to work on getting a package up and running which uses a lightweight desktop environment (as opposed to KDE). However, before I start working on this, I would like to get somewhat of a consensus from the community of what they want.

Putting aside all technical aspects, I am interested in what DE people would want purely from a useability and  point of view and from there I will do whatever necessary to make it happen.

TL;DR - What desktop environment would YOU like Whonix to ship with?</description>

            <p>When XFCE only adds a few MB, we could install it by default, have a combined terminal/KDE/XFCE build and add a menu to RADS (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter</a>). (Using <code>dialog</code>, a menu similar to whonixsetup / whonix_repository.)</p>
<p>One could choose at boot, it remember your last choice, it could have a timeout, I think. Due to technical limitations of <code>dialog</code> I don’t know how to circumvent, it would not have a visible timeout counter.</p>
<p>We CAN do this. It’s an option. Not a decision, of course.</p>
<p>However, it’s very easy to make it modular. Someone else could create a Whonix build that is terminal-only, XFCE-only, KDE-only and so forth. No limitations here.</p>

<p>What paradox? We can add an unlimited amount of new packages to Whonix’s repository.</p>

            <p>No need for a poll: The answer is obvious. Xfce.</p>
<p>The question is how to best implement it. It doesn’t need to be a separate flavor/build of whonix because Patrick has already begun work (have you talked about it yet?) on making a custom desktop switcher on boot that lets you chose between Console/Xfce/KDE.</p>
<p>Paradox could be in charge of add/test/maintain the xfce related stuff in the whonix repo. Or however it is that Patrick does these things.</p>

            <p>Sure. Whatever you find appropriate. I also think a blog post could get more attention.</p>
<p>Either you can register in <a href="http://whonix.org/blog">whonix.org/blog</a>, or suggest a blog message here and I post it, or I can write something. Whatever you prefer.</p>
<p>I already talked to paradox on IRC and welcomed the idea.</p>

<p>Xfce4. I’m using it full time in Whonix, alongside KDE.</p>
<p>For a broader response, may be start a poll thread in Whonix Support. Patrick?</p>
