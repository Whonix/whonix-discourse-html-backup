    <title>Experimenting with Whonix Gateway and Parrot OS: Easy attack on Whonix?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/experimenting-with-whonix-gateway-and-parrot-os-easy-attack-on-whonix/7531</link>
    <description>Today i am experimenting with installation of Whonix Gateway and Parrot OS, hence i found the way to join both machines together work properly but still i am confused why Parrot OS can see through &quot;netdiscover&quot; 2 hosts:

![cleaned|690x278](upload://v9QyFS3Cm0gSLIGChHFDO98ljr7.png) 

I can see actual Whonix Gateway host with 10.152.152.10 but why Parrot identifies 10.0.2.15 with same MAC address and uncovers potential for an attacker to exploit It? For example, i am hacker, i search with netdiscover LAN,  and instead of hacking Gateway, i go for easy target 10.0.2.15 which is an internal adapter on Whonix gateway which connects directly to host OS, is it a feature or real risk to be attacked?

I thought communication between Parrot OS or Whonix Workstation must go strictly only on 10.152.152.10, isnt it?

Perhaps i am noob and see things wrong, please help to explain</description>
