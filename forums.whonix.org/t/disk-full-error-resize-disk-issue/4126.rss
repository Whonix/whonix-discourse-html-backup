    <title>Disk Full Error - Resize Disk Issue</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/disk-full-error-resize-disk-issue/4126</link>
    <description>Hi,

Thanks to the Whonix team for making this available, I&#39;ve been using it for a few months and really hope it stays alive.

I have been running Whonix from a USB drive for a few months but during a recent Debian update to the Gateway I got a Disk Full Error and I was unable to use it anymore. I had a backup on another USB drive without all the backups and that was working and even without the latest updates I got the same error but from the Workstation. There is still plenty of space on the USB so I thought, is it the updates that are to big for the default Disk size set by Whonix?

I created a new installation and moved everything to a different USB3.0 drive that&#39;s 32GB and started to go through the Grow instructions here: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Grow_Virtual_Harddisk

I created the VDI clone but when I try to resize it I get a message saying: Progress State: VBOX_E_NOT_SUPPORTED
VBoxManage: error: Resize medium operation for this format is not implemented yet!

Can anyone help me resize the disks for the Gateway and Workstation and or shed some light as to why I was getting the Disk Full error?

Thanks</description>
