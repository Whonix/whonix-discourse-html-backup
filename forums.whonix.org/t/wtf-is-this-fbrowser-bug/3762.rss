    <title>wtf is this? fbrowser bug</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/wtf-is-this-fbrowser-bug/3762</link>
    <description>Use the whonix like 2 years and allways was ok but yesterday my firefox was lagged. On some sites, such as payment systems, it refuses to run scripts. I mean, the page is working, the browser is working, but the buttons on the site itself are inactive and nothing reagruet. On opera everything works.

i created the new profiles (ALL CLEAR) and that shit come again. What is this can be? Who can block the site scripts on CLEAR profile firefox ESR?</description>

<li>
<p>Tor Browser is the safe and recommended way to browse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t modify FireFox in any way and if you run into problems please take it up with Mozilla.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opera is closed source - even worse for security besides leaking privacy like a sieve.</p>
