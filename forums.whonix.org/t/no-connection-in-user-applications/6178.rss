    <description>I tried to configure openvpn service on this manual https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN

Decided to finish in the middle and put all the settings back (checked several times), after that the user applications stopped working, they do not have connections. stream Isolation and uwt applications work without problems. Please tell me how you can i fix it and what i did wrong.

Before I started setting up openvpn, everything worked fine, I strictly followed the manual and reset all settings back.</description>
