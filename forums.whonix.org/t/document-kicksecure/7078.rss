    <description>Since hardened Debian is in the works its a good time to start thinking about what we want to accomplish when documenting setup. This OS will appeal to a larger subset of users (entry level - developers) so it would be a good idea to first document VirtualBox since it has some advantages over bare metal install or KVM for our first time linux users.

* VirtaulBox is cross platform.
* VirtualBox is easier to use than KVM for new linux user.
* Does not require install on a USB, HDD or dual booting. For many users that only want to try linux out, this is a deal breaker.
* Many (but not all) mistakes that are made in a VM do not have the consequences that they would on bare metal. This invites users to experiment and try out new things that they would have tried otherwise.
* Anything else?

One of the possible problems that could come about is users thinking hardened Debian provides anonymity. For example, Whonix is known for anonymity but a new user that is not paying attention might setup the hardened debian think they are safe. Or someone that uses English as a second language might not notice the warnings. It might be a good idea to separate the two project as much as possible in the wiki. 

Would it be a good idea or even feasible or to create a separate sub-forum for hardened debian?

If anyone has feedback on this project it would be great to hear.

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Update:</p>
<p>There is now a separate server on a separate domain <code>kicksecure.com</code>. Not public yet. This is to avoid confusing users and search engines. Kicksecure must not have a bad start by being conflated with Whonix.</p>
<p>All wiki contents from previously <code>whonix.org</code> where initially replicated there. The rewrite of the wiki to not mention Whonix, to make a standalone project has been started but is far from being completed. With that many wiki pages, it’s a giant effort.</p>
<p>When <code>kicksecure.com</code> is good enough to go online, most references from <code>whonix.org</code> to Kicksecure will be removed wherever that makes sense.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help with the wiki rewrite, please let me know.</p>

<p>I executed <code>Install Whonix.exe</code> from the terminal but don’t have any output. It was executed from the GUI for some reason. Regardless, there were zero problems. Everything extracted as it should and the Whonix VMs started right away. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Users\user\Documents\whonix-installer-zips&gt;"Install Whonix.exe"
</code></pre>
<p>Actually there was one very minor issue. When extracting the files the GUI shows 13.0.0.1.4 as the Whonix version. (I’m not referring to the Whonix.ova images though) I believe this can be fixed by updating the source files?</p>

            <p>Looks like at the end of the installer it starts Whonix.exe and if that’s just a dummy it would fail in that way. If you replaced dummy Whonix.exe with a “better dummy” (any standalone exe) then likely this issue wouldn’t happen, I speculate.</p>

            <p>I’ve been researching ideas on best uses cases of screenshots. (when to use them and when not to). For Hardened Debian we are going to limit them to areas that are difficult to explain and or understand. I going to use Thunderbird tutorial as an example.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Encrypted_Email_with_Thunderbird_and_Enigmail" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Encrypted_Email_with_Thunderbird_and_Enigmail</a></p>
<p>This tutorial is very long and could be extremely confusing. The use of screen shots decreases difficulty and confusion in the areas that most users would struggle. tempest only uses them in places where they are really needed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, looking at Tor Browser without Tor tutorial</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Tor_Browser_without_Tor" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Tor_Browser_without_Tor</a></p>
<p>0brand used 3 screenshots but only 1  really added any value to the tutorial. Step 2, Disable <code>socks</code> network <code>DNS</code> ; could be a little confusing to users so this would be good use of a screenshot. All of the other ones could be removed (don’t really help the user)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to let everyone know of my intentions to an apply for GSoD 2019 as an technical writer. As you I’m sure you already know, I’m very interested in Hardened Debian for first time Linux users. The first thing I want to do is dispel a few incorrect assumptions that seem to be circulating about this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is not a watered down version of Hardened Debian. While this documentation is focused on first time Linux users I plan on keeping the educational areas on pages separate from the core documentation. In essence, Hardened Debian can be thought of as two separate projects rolled into one. Keep in mind this documentation <strong>must</strong> be kept separate from the current Whonix docs. Why? Confusing Hardened Debian for Whonix could be a distaste for someone who requires anonymity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing that must be completed is the Core documentation. For the most part, this will be like the Whonix core documentation. There will be a few differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documentation will be formated using a book like structure like Tails OS. See <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation will be more user friendly. Take a look at both <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started</a> and <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2017/06/27/qubes-admin-api/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2017/06/27/qubes-admin-api/</a> . What do you notice right from the start? This was written as though the writer was talking directly to <em>you</em>. While both  <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/team/#andrew-david-wong" rel="nofollow noopener">Andrew David Wong</a>  (the person who wrote and maintains much of the Qubes docs) and <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/team/#joanna-rutkowska" rel="nofollow noopener">Joanna Rrutkowska</a> (Qubes founder) are capable of writing very high level tech documentation, they chose to use simple terminology  and give the documentation more humanistic qualities.</p>
<p>Why write documentation like this? Think about this for now, and I’ll be creating a few polls in the coming days to get some feedback on how <em>you</em> (the community) would like the docs for this project written.   For more on this subject; see <em>Aral Balkan: Superheroes &amp; Villains in Design</em> <a href="https://vimeo.com/70030549" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vimeo.com/70030549</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Core documentation will include:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> there will be <strong>no</strong> learning areas in the core documentation! There will only be navigation aids to learning areas along with the required knowledge for the specific tutorial. Oh, and a few small “tip” templates here and there.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview for first time users</li>
<li>Hardware requirements</li>
<li>Design  and goals</li>
<li>Features and advantages</li>
<li>FAQs</li>
<li>Download, verify, and installation</li>
<li>First steps</li>
<li>Troubleshooting (known issues)</li>
<li>What core documentation do would you like to see included for this GSoD project?</li>
</ul>
<p>Next is documentation for educating new Linux users so they can stand on their own two feet when using Linux:</p>
<p>Teaching new Linux users is not about writing a few <code>man</code> pages and calling it an educational area. The only way users will learn is by immersing them in ClI right from the start. However, <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/onion_knight">@onion_knight</a> night was right when he/she said this has been done thousands and thousands of time before. So lets do something different. (Something that will actually work).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>man</code> pages: Why should we have a man page section in our documentation? New users know absolutely nothing about terminals/Cli. If the information they need isn’t easy to find or accessible they will end up opening a support request without even trying to find an solution.</p>
<p>This section will document commonly used commands and practical command syntax.  Each <code>man</code> will give a brief outline of the command, how to use it along with practical examples.  It takes a while for users to remember the commands they have to use for different tasks. Through repetition they will remember how to use each one over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem solving: Capable/experienced Linux users have good problem solving skills that they acquire over time. When a problem arises they automatically start searching for a solution, and keep searching until they find an answer or all possible resources have been exhausted. When a new Linux user encounters a problem they automatically open a support request. So, its vital that we encourage – through well written documentation and forum policy – good practices from the very beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Practical problem solving: This will be a tutorial based on troubleshooting best practices. <em>Similar</em> to the Free support principle but this is detailed step by step instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring log files: Location of system logs (what each one is used for) and commands needed to narrow down the Cli output. (journalctl, dmesg etc…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systemd: status, starting and stopping services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshooting: Connection issues, broken software packages etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating backups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would you like to see included in the educational section?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Very detailed guidelines will be written for bug and/or issues reporting. Keep in mind this will be different from <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Reporting_Guidelines" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Reporting_Guidelines</a>. This will be similar to <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/reporting-bugs/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/reporting-bugs/</a> (Simple human friendly language but very detailed).</p>
<p>To make it easier for the community members providing forum support, templates will be made which can be used when community members do not follow forum best practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate topic: Please follow the guidelines before creating new threads. (with link to forum best practices)</li>
<li>Off topic: Please follow the guidleines when when contributing to forum discussions. (with link to forum best practices)</li>
<li>etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind that my commitment to the Hardened Debian doc does not end at the completion of GSoD. I plan on maintaining/enhancing the documentation afterwards. So we can afford to try some experimenting with in areas such as formatting and writing style. If the docs need to be changes after the project ends, I’m more than happy to do that. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><strong>Feedback is very much appreciated!</strong></p>

            <p>Just now reworked Whonix Windows installer a bit. The repository seems in great shape. Please see <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/windows-installer/1909/95" class="inline-onebox">Windows Installer</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to skip building the <code>Whonix.exe</code> which is the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Building_Whonix-UI_for_Windows" rel="nofollow noopener">user interface</a> (start and stop Whonix buttons) then a dummy file (some exe or arbitrary file renamed to <code>Whonix.exe</code> should do.</p>
<p>(It’s not the job of the installer of vetting the <code>Whonix.exe</code> file. Therefore any file existing with that name satisfies it for testing purposes.)<br>
(Dunno if your Windows version nowadays allows easily to change the file extension or if it is nowadays showing file extensions or not.)</p>

</aside>
<p>In theory it looks easy. See my last two commits to <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer</a> where I ported to unified ova and dropped x86 support.</p>
<p>I guess I could easily create the hardened debian windows installer (presupposes new builds of hardened debian and new name which should also be very doable). Rather than <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix-Windows-Installer/blob/master/Whonix.iss#L44" rel="nofollow noopener">unregistervm</a> gateway and workstation, just hardened debian. And whenever a file of string contains <code>Whonix</code> rename that too. Perhaps no UI for hardened debian since just a single VM for now?</p>
<p>Not sure if it builds. Chances are good. Instructions look very doable but kinda daunting to set up a build environment and actually sit down to do it.</p>

            <p>For the Hardened Debian documentation a decision would have to be made on the initial host to use; either Windows or Linux. Since new to Linux users are targeted (along with advanced users) it might be a good idea to start with Windows?</p>
<p>I fresh installed Whonix on a Windows host a short time ago to see what it was like. (Its been a while) The first thing i noticed was the <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Verify_the_virtual_machine_images_using_Windows" rel="nofollow noopener">verify the VMs in Windows</a> tutorial was confusing. Keep in mind i intentionally followed <em>only</em> the instructions as they were written. There were a few reason for this confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>I had to keep jumping around to different 3rd party websites to get all the information I needed.</li>
<li>The 3rd party websites did not have good documentation like <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix.org</a>. We provide intuitive step by step tutorials for our community.</li>
<li>Had to keep jumping to different wiki pages to get all the keys, signatures etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Hardended Debian is to target beginners we can do better than this. The great thing about new documentation is templates can be made, which can then be used to enhance other areas of our documentation. For example, if template variables were used for “Verify the Hardended Debian image in Windows” page. They could also be used to fix the “Verify Whonix in Windows” page. While Hardened Debian would be the focus, this is definitely doable.</p>
<p>Please note: The focus of this thread is <em>Document Installation and Setup of the New Security-focused Hardened Debian Linux Distribution</em>. In the context of:</p>

</ul>
<p>Any feedback that a technical writer could use to move this project forward is very welcome.</p>

<p>When you want to <code>cd</code> down to the next lowest directory you can use a <code>dash -</code> instead of an absolute file path. For long paths/directory names, this is a big time saver.</p>
<p>Using an absolute path.</p>
<p><code>user@host:~/files/new_files$ cd ~/files/</code><br>
<code>user@host:~/files$</code></p>
<p>Using an <code>dash -</code></p>
<p><code>user@host:~/files/new_files$ cd -</code><br>
<code>user@host:~/files$</code></p>
<p>Templates could be made for each Tip and used in other parts of the wiki. Maybe we could build the template so a user could hover their mouse pointer over “Tip” to see the content? That way the Template wouldn’t be intrusive. (We don’t want to force feed them info.)</p>
<p>We shouldn’t assume anything is common knowledge when it comes to Linux beginners. For example, maybe not everyone will know they can hit “Tab” for Cli autocomplete.</p>

  <blockquote>
    We can’t call it Hardened Debian. 
As per <a href="https://www.debian.org/trademark" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.debian.org/trademark</a> a new name as to be found. 


Use the Debian trademarks in their exact form, neither abbreviated or hyphenated, nor combined with any other word or words.


A new project name has to be found. 

It shouldn’t imply anonymity anything.
We shouldn’t be watering down the Whonix brand by calling it WhonixClearnet or something. (That name would be a contradiction too.)

Suggestions?

            <p>Since hardened Debian is in the works its a good time to start thinking about what we want to accomplish when documenting setup. This OS will appeal to a larger subset of users (entry level - developers) so it would be a good idea to first document VirtualBox since it has some advantages over bare metal install or KVM for our first time linux users.</p>
<ul>
<li>VirtaulBox is cross platform.</li>
<li>VirtualBox is easier to use than KVM for new linux user.</li>
<li>Does not require install on a USB, HDD or dual booting. For many users that only want to try linux out, this is a deal breaker.</li>
<li>Many (but not all) mistakes that are made in a VM do not have the consequences that they would on bare metal. This invites users to experiment and try out new things that they would have tried otherwise.</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the possible problems that could come about is users thinking hardened Debian provides anonymity. For example, Whonix is known for anonymity but a new user that is not paying attention might setup the hardened debian think they are safe. Or someone that uses English as a second language might not notice the warnings. It might be a good idea to separate the two project as much as possible in the wiki.</p>
<p>Would it be a good idea or even feasible or to create a separate sub-forum for hardened debian?</p>
<p>If anyone has feedback on this project it would be great to hear.</p>

“sudo apt-get install kicksecure-cli” will be possible on bare metal Debian hosts, in other words installations of Debian can be easily converted into Kicksecure by installing the kicksecure-cli or other hardened debian package
maybe later available as ISO for installation on hardware depending on community interest and support
