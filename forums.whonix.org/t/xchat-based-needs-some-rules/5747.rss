    <description>I noticed `hexchat` is having trouble with current profiles. Wouldn&#39;t make any connections without a rule added to `abstractions/xchat-based` for `/etc/resolv.conf.anondist r,`.

There&#39;s also some `DENIED` entries for `/etc/hosts`, but didn&#39;t seem to effect functionality yet. Not sure if this one is intentional since not explicitly denied.

---

Is there a better place to report these? Phabricator? Not familiar with it, but I made an account that&#39;s waiting on approval.</description>
