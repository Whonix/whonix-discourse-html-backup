    <title>Best way to use whonix with 2 hosts ? (Physical Isolation)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/best-way-to-use-whonix-with-2-hosts-physical-isolation/920</link>
    <description>Hi all,
as i have a very old computer, i&#39;m tired to launch 2 VMs in order to use Whonix, i think i&#39;m about to proceed on a Physical Isolation without any virtualization, to gain some RAM and comfort. It is to say : 2 hosts.
If i understand well, the better way to do that is to install Whonix-Gateway on HOST 1 and then any Whonix-Workstation on HOST 2.
All is explained here : https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation/9&amp;redirect=no

I have some questions about Hardware.
[u]1st HOST[/u]
I suppose an old laptop would do the job. I used to launch Whonix-Gateway with 128 MB RAM (command line).
What about a Raspberry Pi ? Powerfull enough ? I wasn&#39;t able to find any review. (http://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/discussion/general/thread/30381157/)
If i understand well, in the case of a clean laptop with a wifi dongle.
Steps are :
1) Get Debian =&gt; OK
2) Install Debian =&gt; OK
3) Network Configuration =&gt; [u]step where i must download/install my wifi dongle drivers[/u] ?
4) Logon &amp; Update/Upgrade Debian =&gt; OK
5) Preparation =&gt; Ok
6) Get [u]W[/u]honix =&gt; OK

[u]2nd HOST[/u] (In a case of a Windows XP)
i only need to connect &quot;HOST 1&quot; to &quot;HOST 2&quot; with ethernet cable and the job is done ?
I mean, in the windows network manager, if i only use &quot;whonix gateway network ethernet connexion&quot; to navigate on a browser, my IP address will be the one from the gateway ?

<p>I wouldn’t use old hardware especially devices with  core2duo CPUs as Intel has stopped support for spectra meltdown</p>

<p>Clean hardware is a big challenge in my opinion.</p>
<p>I remember in past when my BTC was stolen using win7 and blockchain on such old laptops . Never again</p>

This applies:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian
<blockquote>2nd HOST (In a case of a Windows XP)
i only need to connect "HOST 1" to "HOST 2" with ethernet cable and the job is done ?

Then network settings you can find on https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems applies.
<p>(Needless to say, a lot speaks against Windows, XP.)</p>
