    <title>systemd config: restore autostart on tty2-5</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/systemd-config-restore-autostart-on-tty2-5/4175</link>
    <description>This is more related to systemd than Whonix, but the Whonix developers set it up this way, so I am asking here.

I can&#39;t find the correct solution in my searches for Linux, Debian or systemd configuration.  I just want to restore the getty@.service for tty2-5 to the default behaviour.

I tried `systemctl enable getty@tty2.service` but that makes it run all the time instead of autostarting when you switch to that virtual terminal.

Basically I just want to know what was done to prevent them from starting so I can undo it.</description>

            <p>Let me start off by saying I know how frustrating It can be when you can’t find a solution to your problem.  Unfortunately I don’t have an answer for you. I do believe however, that you will have better luck finding an answer on the <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com">Unix and Linux Stack Exchange</a></p>
<p>Also the <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Support">Whonix Support</a> page has some helpful information that I think may be of use to you. If you post your question on Stack Exchange make sure to add the <em>whonix</em> tag.</p>
<p>Please don’t take this the wrong way. I understand that you are using Whonix but this is more of a general Debian/Linux issue. Not only that but you are much more likely to get a solution to your issue as the Stack Exchange community is much bigger than the Whonix  community and more eyes will see your question.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
