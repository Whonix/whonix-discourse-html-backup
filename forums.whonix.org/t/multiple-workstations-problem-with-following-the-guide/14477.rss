    <title>Multiple workstations - Problem with following the guide</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-workstations-problem-with-following-the-guide/14477</link>
    <description>Hello there.
I&#39;m following the guide on the wiki for multiple Workstations.
(Can&#39;t include link)

But i don&#39;t understand how to assign a new MAC address:
The guide says:

&gt; KVM: To change the internal network in KVM, see: Creating Multiple Internal Networks.

Following the link it states:

&gt; Open the Whonix ™ network XML file and change the name attribute to something different than the internal network that is currently running, for example &#39;Whonix-Internal2&#39;, &#39;Whonix-Internal3&#39; and so on. The default network name in use is &#39;Whonix-Internal&#39;.

I don&#39;t understand what exactly i am supposed to do here?</description>
