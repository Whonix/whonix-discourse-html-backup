    <title>[SOLVED] Whonix 8 Broke the SSHFS Instructions</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-whonix-8-broke-the-sshfs-instructions/205</link>
    <description>I consistently rely upon the SSHFS instructions and just upgraded my Whonix install from version 7 to 8. Everything in the instructions worked well under Whonix 7. Under Whonix 8 the instructions don&#39;t seem to be compatible anymore. Also the two following pages have conflicting instructions in them.


http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway

http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/Sshfs_into_Whonix-Workstation



&quot;Look at the /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default config file.&quot;

vs.

&quot;echo &quot;GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH=1&quot; | sudo tee -a &quot;/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user&quot;&quot;

In Whonix 8, I modified the 30_default file, which seems to be the right one. Host to Gateway SSH working this way.



&quot;/usr/bin/ssh.real user@192.168.0.11&quot;

vs. 

&quot;ssh.real 192.168.0.11&quot;

In Whonix 8, with &quot;/usr/bin/ssh.real user@192.168.0.11&quot; I get the following error:

&quot;bash: /usr/bin/ssh.real: No such file or directory&quot;

In Whonix 8, with &quot;ssh.real 192.168.0.11&quot; I get the following error:

&quot;libtorsocks(12021): connect: Connection is to a local address (192.168.0.11), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks
ssh: connect to host 192.168.0.11 port 22: No such file or directory&quot;



I&#39;m blocked at the &quot;ssh.real&quot; step not working with the libtorsocks error.

I can SSH and SSHFS into the Gateway fine, but the hop to the Workstation is not working yet.

I&#39;ve been using SSHFS successfully on a daily basis with Whonix 7, so could the SSHFS instructions be updated to work with Whonix 8, please?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I’ve got it working now on stock Whonix 8.</p>
<p>Beyond the “ssh.whonix-orig” change, issues were likely to do with my personal configuration.</p>
<p>Reset everything to clean state on host, imported new Whonix 8 VMs, and got it working with updated instructions.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Patrick!</p>

            <blockquote>The only changed part was the ".whonix-org part". The ssh/sshfs commands are unchanged.</blockquote>
<p>Correct. Yet, it’s funny that the normal SSH hop statement does currently require passing in the “ssh.whonix-orig” command name in order to successfully complete a second hop from Gateway to Workstation.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -t user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 "ssh.whonix-orig user@192.168.0.11"</code></pre>
<blockquote>As far I understand "ssh -f user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -L 2222:192.168.0.11:22 -N" uses ssh from the host. It doesn't need the ssh binary from Whonix-Gateway.</blockquote>
<p>Ok, then this would nullify my theory, if that is the case.</p>
<p>Has been a while since I looked at the man page for the inner mechanics of the SSHFS hop statement, so I’m not currently sure.</p>
<blockquote>But since seeing is beveling and since your idea is not unreasonable, feel free to restore the original ssh command. See:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation#Deactivating_an_uwt_wrapper</blockquote>
<p>Looks like I might have to go this route next in order to get it working again. Thank you.</p>
<p>It would be nice if someone could at least confirm a successful attempt to SSHFS into Whonix-Workstation with a stock Whonix 8 install, so that we can know that the “ssh” rename to “ssh.whonix-orig” does not break the SSHFS File Transfer instructions.</p>

The binary required in memory for ssh’ing has already been loaded on the host. Another reason why I think this is not the case is that these instructions worked for Whonix 7 as well.

<p>After applying this, there will be no more Whonix specific additions to that ssh command. And when you run “ssh 192.168.0.10” in Whonix-Gateway for testing, it won’t show that torsocks error anymore. Then you removed all Whonix specific changes and are back to a basic sshfs problem.</p>

<p>Correct. I too, originally spent many many hours dealing with this in Whonix 7 to get SSH/SSHFS hopping to work for me.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Correct. I had originally done these steps, as I’ve always done them with my Whonix 7 SSHFS setup as well. No current SSH/SSHFS processes existed (killed them). No current known_hosts files existed (rm’d them).</p>
<p>Here’s my thinking about the SSH/SSHFS commands…</p>
<p>Currently, in Whonix 8, I can successfully SSH hop from Host to Gateway to Workstation. SSH hopping is working fine, if I include the “ssh.whonix-orig” command into the hop statement for the Gateway to Workstation step…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -t user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 "ssh.whonix-orig user@192.168.0.11"</code></pre>
<p>However, let’s examine the first ssh part of the SSHFS hop command…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -f user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 -L 2222:192.168.0.11:22 -N</code></pre>
<p>On the Host to Gateway step, this “ssh” command should work fine, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>However, once this hop statement gets to the Gateway to Workstation step, isn’t it just going to repeat another “ssh” command inside the Gateway, instead of the now renamed “ssh.whonix-orig”?</p>
<p>There seems to be nothing here telling the Gateway to use the renamed “ssh.whonix-orig” statement.</p>
<p>In the normal SSH (non-SSHFS) hop command, the “ssh.whonix-orig” statement gets put into the second part of the command…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ssh -t user@127.0.0.1 -p 2200 "ssh.whonix-orig user@192.168.0.11"</code></pre>
<p>So, why wouldn’t the SSHFS hop command also need to be instructed of this renamed “ssh.whonix-orig” command once it gets to the second Gateway to Workstation hopping step?</p>
<p>It just seems like the Gateway to Workstation step can no longer use the “ssh” command, but somehow needs to be instructed to use the renamed “ssh.whonix-orig” command.</p>

Both works. Generally, it is better to modify "50_" files. Reason for this and background knowledge is a bit better documented here:

ssh.real changed to ssh.whonix-orig. Updated the articles.

The usual "ssh" command is socksified by default (for stream isolation https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation). The non-socksified version must be used.
<p>It should be fixed now. But I haven’t tested it.</p>
<p>This is a quite common misconception when using default-socksified applications for local connections. I opened a github issue:<br>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I consistently rely upon the SSHFS instructions and just upgraded my Whonix install from version 7 to 8. Everything in the instructions worked well under Whonix 7. Under Whonix 8 the instructions don’t seem to be compatible anymore. Also the two following pages have conflicting instructions in them.</p>
<p><a href="http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion/wiki/File_Transfer#SSH_into_Whonix-Gateway</a></p>

<p>“Look at the /etc/whonix_firewall.d/30_default config file.”</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>“echo “GATEWAY_ALLOW_INCOMING_SSH=1” | sudo tee -a “/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user””</p>
<p>In Whonix 8, I modified the 30_default file, which seems to be the right one. Host to Gateway SSH working this way.</p>
<p>“/usr/bin/ssh.real <a href="mailto:user@192.168.0.11">user@192.168.0.11</a>”</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>“ssh.real 192.168.0.11”</p>
<p>In Whonix 8, with “/usr/bin/ssh.real <a href="mailto:user@192.168.0.11">user@192.168.0.11</a>” I get the following error:</p>
<p>“bash: /usr/bin/ssh.real: No such file or directory”</p>
<p>In Whonix 8, with “ssh.real 192.168.0.11” I get the following error:</p>
<p>“libtorsocks(12021): connect: Connection is to a local address (192.168.0.11), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry" rel="nofollow noopener">http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry</a> if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks<br>
ssh: connect to host 192.168.0.11 port 22: No such file or directory”</p>
<p>I’m blocked at the “ssh.real” step not working with the libtorsocks error.</p>
<p>I can SSH and SSHFS into the Gateway fine, but the hop to the Workstation is not working yet.</p>
<p>I’ve been using SSHFS successfully on a daily basis with Whonix 7, so could the SSHFS instructions be updated to work with Whonix 8, please?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
