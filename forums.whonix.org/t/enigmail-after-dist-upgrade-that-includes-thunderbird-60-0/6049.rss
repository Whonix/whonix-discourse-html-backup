    <description>After the last run of apt-get dist-upgrade, which included an upgrade to thunderbird 60.0, enigmail disappears from the context menus in thunderbird and is no longer active.  from the command line, i did &quot;sudo apt-get install --reinstall enigmail&quot; and received the following error:

&gt; Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
&gt; requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
&gt; distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
&gt; or been moved out of Incoming.
&gt; The following information may help to resolve the situation:
&gt; 
&gt; The following packages have unmet dependencies:
&gt;  enigmail : Depends: thunderbird (&gt;= 1:52.0) but it is not going to be installed or icedove (&gt;= 1:52.0)
&gt; E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

if one installs enigmail via thunderbird through the xpi that comes up in thunderbird&#39;s search, it works fine.  anyone else having the same issue? it appears debian has not included the latest version of enigmail in the repos. the downloaded version is 2.0.8. the repo version in stretch is 1.9.9, which may have compatibility issues.</description>

  <blockquote>
    solving this for users who will ask about it: 
download TorBirdy + Engimail manually: 

<a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/" rel="nofollow noopener">TorBirdy</a>
<a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/" rel="nofollow noopener">Enigmail</a>

After that open ThunderBird and follow the images:
