    <title>Setting up a VPN in Whonix Gateway.</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/setting-up-a-vpn-in-whonix-gateway/3813</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m using NordVPN, and trying to set it up in Whonix Gateway using openvpn. I&#39;ve been following https://www.whonix.org/w/index.php?title=Tunnels/Connecting_to_a_VPN_before_Tor&amp;section=7#Inside_Whonix-Gateway

I followed this for the firewall setup, then at the &quot;VPN setup&quot; subsection of &quot;Inside_whonix-gateway&quot; I downloaded the .ovpn files and followed this guide: https://nordvpn.com/nl/tutorials/linux/openvpn/

Anyway, I tried connecting and I was prompted to enter my NordVPN username and password. 
However, after entering them, I get &quot;No route to host errors&quot; every 5 seconds. Any ideas? Maybe its because I used the .ovpn file instead of following the tutorial. I did this because the NordVPN is more complex than the RiseUp one shown in the example in the documentation I was looking at and I didn&#39;t know what to add and what to leave out of the .config file.

Thanks in advance, if I fix this I&#39;ll add this to the documentation as NordVPN is quite popular and therefore it would make a good addition to that page.</description>

<p>VPN-Firewall does not work inside Whonix. Same functionality is provided through TUNNEL_FIREWALL as per Whonix documentation.</p>

            <p>This still relies on having a VPN connection in the gateway though…? I think you may have misunderstood when I said the error messages comes up every 5 seconds. I meant that it doesn’t connect at all and repeats every 5 seconds because it is retrying connection, it never manages to connect because there is an error in my setup; this is what I am trying to diagnose. Maybe its because I’m using a .ovpn file. At the moment I am trying to get the VPN working - thats what I need help with.</p>
<p>Tell me what you need me to send and I’ll post it here (config files, etc).<br>
Thanks for your reply though - been pulling my hair out with this for hours.</p>
