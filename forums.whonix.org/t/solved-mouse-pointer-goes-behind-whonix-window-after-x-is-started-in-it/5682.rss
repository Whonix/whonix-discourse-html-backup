    <title>[SOLVED]Mouse pointer goes behind Whonix window after X is started in it</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-mouse-pointer-goes-behind-whonix-window-after-x-is-started-in-it/5682</link>
    <description>Hello, again. Recently I started 14 Whonix (both Gateway and Workstation) on my Host.
And so, the adventures are continue :slight_smile:
Now the mouse pointer is going &quot;under&quot; any Whonix OS window after the X.org is started on it. If I click on the window before the X.org started, it handles it, and suggestion of pressing L_Ctrl+L_Alt to release the mouse is apear. But after KDE starts the pointer becomes invisible at the all window area. If I move it out of Whonix window it appears on the Host desktop area and working well.

What is the problem with it?</description>

            <p>Thanks! The second.<br>
At the VM window (Virt-Manager) menu: View -&gt; Scale Display -&gt; Auto resize VM with window<br>
The last must be unchecked.</p>

            <p>That could be caused by two things: you using something different than SPICE for graphics or you attempting to change resolution. The latter is broken in the most recent KDE as it can;t automatically expand the VM screen. Which is it?</p>
