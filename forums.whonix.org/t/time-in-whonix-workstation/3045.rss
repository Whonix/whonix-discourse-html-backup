<p>A difference is fine. If you host clock is accurate, then the difference<br>
should be mostly just a few seconds up to few minutes.</p>

<p>Is recommended to change OS time zone?</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>This isn’t a security issue. Time Sync is there to prevent Time zone leaks, however, it of course isn’t able to prevent a server from knowing when you access it. After all, if you visit a website at 5AM local time, than you did so at 5AM local time.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Ego</p>
