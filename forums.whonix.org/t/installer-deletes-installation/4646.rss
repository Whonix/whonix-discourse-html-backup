            <p>Didn’t know that the Whonix installer does not support installation to other drives. Then again, why the option to choose one? Seems that above error gets generated when Whonix is not on OS drive. One more thought that crossed my mind is Whonix obviously takes a good amount of space. So it’d would be really better to have an option to install it on other drives as now (and I know this is subjective) newer machines have SSDs for OS drive. Which are not that large in terms of space.</p>
<p>Simple solution for the current installer is to give an error if a user chooses other drives or an initial message asking to install it on OS drive only. Unlike now where the installer still finishes the installation with a “Success!” message and then Whonix shortcut tells you to get help.</p>
<p>The method to import images is the only way for now for installation on other drives.</p>

<p>Just to make sure I understand this correctly, ( I’m not very familiar with VBox or installer) after the images are imported into VBox, they are deleted to prevent confusion if user has to reinstall the images or wants to upgrade to newer Whonix version at a later date?

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Wait, so you’d like to run Whonix from a driver other than C? That is currently not supported for a variety of reasons. As the images, again, need to be imported to work, not stay in said folder, using any non system drive is currently not something managable with VBoxManage which is what is required to import the images.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the installer was specifically set up in such a way as that it only imports a new image, not touching any older machines present in VBox. This is done, as to ensure that no user data is deleted or lost on accident.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>

            <p>We are limited to Wonix installation that uses an executable for the scope of this topic. I am aware about importing the images the old way to VBox. That is more like a workaround. Not a solution.</p>
<p>I am still confused about the upgrade procedure. How will Whonix handle a new upgrade over an old/corrupted one that are already present in VBox? And what does that have to do with the deletion of images?</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not all that familiar with VBox so these are just suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li>have you tried starting Whonix directly from VBox (i.e not from the desktop shortcut)?</li>
<li>have you tired to reinstall the images as the error suggests? (may not be necessary)</li>
<li>have a looked at <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/where-to-download-ova-for-win-separately-without-installer/4531">this thread</a>, you <strong>could</strong> be having a similar problem which may be resolved by downloading the <code>whoninx.ova</code> images separately (without installer)</li>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are very good reason for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>If a user is having problems with the new install and has to reinstall (download) the <code>whonix.ova</code> images again, it would be very difficult ( if not impossible ) to tell the ‘good’ images, from the corrupted ones when they are imported into VBox. This would cause problems for the installer.</li>
<li>If you wanted to download a new version of whonix ( e.g. you’re using Whonix 13 and want to upgrade to the new Whonix 14 when relesed ).Once aging this could cause problems for the user ( confusing the old and new images) and the installer (does not know which images to import)</li>

            <p>Hi <code>dawson</code></p>
<p>I managed to download and view your <code>png.</code> image. I was not able to load the image so I transcribed it so <code>Ego</code> can take a look at it to make sure I am correct. What you are seeing is the whonix.ova images being deleted <em>after</em> installation. This is normal behavior. Both Whonix workstation and gateway should still be on your system. You should be able to find them in VirtualBox, that is were the images are after imported.</p>
