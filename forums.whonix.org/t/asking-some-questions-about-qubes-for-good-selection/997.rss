    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/asking-some-questions-about-qubes-for-good-selection/997</link>
    <description>i have some questions would like to ask for more info to get , hope im not annoying u :D

A- is there a comparison/differences regarding the security when using:- 

1- Qubes os =&gt; whonix os  

2- host (linux os) =&gt; KVM =&gt; whonix os

3- host (windows os) =&gt; virtualbox =&gt; whonix os

is there an tested comparison table regarding leaks and advantages to the above points? , like for e.g similar comparison of whonix and tails and other anonymity operating systems? (even if its theoretical).if no , why do u think Qubes is more useful to be used instead of the 2,3 method? 

B- did anyone pentested Qubes for vulnerabilities ? like DNS leak and malicious attack...etc. if yes , is there a table for the tests that have been tested on Qubes OS ? if no,is it a work on idea which is in process?

C- is Qubes OS encrypting the hard drive ? if yes , which algorithm of the encryption is using ? 

D- why not Qubes OS coming with whonix OS already configured/installed inside it ? if its a bad idea, can u list some reasons if that possible?  

E- do u need any help in Qubes OS ? like for e.g testers and developers and crackers...etc? if yes, can u list ur needs?

thnx for ur patient with my Questions , i know it might be long, hope u take them with magnanimously feelings ;) .</description>

<p>u mean 192-bit AES, and 256-bit AES?[/quote]</p>
<p>No, different than bit-length, like AES and another different algorithm. Escaping me. Shows it in the installer, I believe.</p>

<p>btw im trying qubes OS on my old laptop (i will give the feed back of my trail). but i would like to ask u , would u like that i make video tutorial on how to install Qubes OS and other stuffs to do after installation ?

</aside>
<p>I might be interested in using such a video, if you were to contribute it. Just depends on how it turns out, I guess. Up to you on if you want to do it. But I would certainly take a look at it and maybe use it with your permission.</p>
<p>Certainly an issue with install videos is that they do become out of date when things change. Qubes version will change. Whonix install commands and procedure will probably change some.</p>
<p>Might be more lasting to make videos based on fundamentals of configuration and using Whonix on top of Qubes, instead of just installing. Install videos may quickly become stale.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not that I know of. Although, I’m sure a number of users and Qubes devs have done their own personal testing.</p>
<p>With updates, software is always changing anyway, so one day’s tests could be invalidated the next day.</p>

<p>This is under future consideration by the Qubes developers. Qubes + Whonix is still a relatively young project. Just not there yet. But the Qubes team has expressed such potential ideas for the future.</p>

<p>Yes, more help is welcome and needed.</p>
<p>Development help probably has the most impact.</p>
<p>Everyone is always free to test and post their findings.</p>
<p>There are a number of critical low-level systems issues that I’d like to see worked on that we don’t have the support for.</p>
<p>There’s been other ad-hoc discussions on this forum about implementing the Whonix Qubes high-level code in more straightforward ways.</p>
<p>VM entropy needs to be verified and worked on.</p>
<p>General code maintenance of keeping things up to date and bug fixes as they come up.</p>
<p>Others, <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> and <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/nrgaway">@nrgaway</a> could probably list some more things.</p>
<p>Some stuff is in our tracker: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/tracker/Qubes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/tracker/Qubes</a></p>
