    <title>Possible TOR backdoor</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/possible-tor-backdoor/14235</link>
    <description>The whonixTM wiki currently assumes that aside of known network attacks based on TOR and operational security fails of their users that TOR would hold against all kind of attacks except targeted (network) attacks and malicious relays. one thing that is not documented is security of TOR source code and their encryption choices.

in this thread I will discuss in detail a possible TOR backdoor in current TOR agent (and TOR Rust rewrite) that makes all TOR traffic same as unencrypted HTTP traffic.

before I start I recommend you read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography&quot;&gt;ECDSA&lt;/a&gt; and it&#39;s proven &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Backdoors&quot;&gt;backdoor&lt;/a&gt;
while there are projects like SafeCurves they all focused on implementing simpler and less secure implementation in order to merely hopefully reduce chance of backdoor working, this approach wouldn&#39;t work due fact they still use same bugged algorithm. 

For longest time I thought TOR used RSA but as turns out it has been using ECDSA for quite a while now. I tried contacting TOR developers to see why they chose it over RSA but to no avail. 
so I consulted wiki and ECDSA apparently has a small improvement of speed when signing but RSA is still faster while encrypting which again most operations in TOR code are encrypting and not signing

And to add more nails to coffin both ECDSA and RSA fail when it comes to quantum computers, however, RSA is proven to be much more secure against traditional computers than ECDSA is.
ECDSA is also a lot more complex algorithm wise which opens up for more backdoors and attacks in implementations aside from the main backdoor

It doesn&#39;t make sense why they would insert a bugged algorithm in a software that is used by a lot of important and vulnerable people
TOR developers are not amateurs they have chosen ECDSA for a reason despite it&#39;s proven backdoor

Someone like NSA who also been proven to spy on cables in sea would be able to capture TOR traffic and decipher them without running a single relay

I am not sure how this flew under the radar. I am not sure what whonixTM could do about this except the very laborious switching to another network. This is merely a discussion and not fear mongering post</description>

            <p>FWIW I’m going to make more time for the Whonix forum in the future. Re: I2P - ElGamal will be entirely phased out when SSU2 is complete. It will be available optionally for the forseeable future as a backward-compatibility feature for dual-keyed I2P services(ElGamal+ECIES-X25519) but won’t be used for anything by default. We are just beginning our first discussions of post-quantum I2P.</p>

            <p>“…that makes all TOR traffic same as unencrypted HTTP traffic.”</p>
<p>In this context, perhaps the following is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I and some other users have noticed since the latest update of the TorBrowser and the associated permanent activation of the “Only https mode” that in certain random situations the warning is issued that no “https version” of the corresponding page exists, although this is demonstrably not true. It also asks if you want to view the page in http mode.<br>
Since http is still rarely used today and the messages are increasing, it is to be considered:</p>
<p>This could be a bug. But it could also be that this is intended to tempt users to actually call up a page without https and thus become more “transparent”.</p>
<p>This is supported by the fact that the warning message disappears in almost all cases after changing the circuit.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t see how developer anonymity vs pseudonymity vs real name use makes any difference in this context. It’s not like developers of some project are anonymous and not communicating about their plans with anyone. Maybe there are such projects but it seems to me it is quite possible to ask questions to I2P and seems like at least lots of them are also answerd.</p>

<p>Not entirely true, firstly I2P (java) current developers are not<br>
anonymous whether zzz or eyedeekay or eche|on or str4d none of them<br>
anonymous (the only core developer which disappeared in 2006~ was<br>
anonymous jrandom).</p>
<p>secondly El-Gamal yes it was used but not on the roadmap anymore,<br>
current I2P tunnels can use only ECIES-X25519 or both, but not going to<br>

<p>Dual_EC_DRBG (Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator) is an algorithm  that was presented as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) using methods in elliptic curve cryptography.  Despite wide public criticism, including the public identification of a backdoor, it was for seven years one of four CSPRNGs standardized in NIST SP 800-90A as originally published circa June 2006, until it was withdrawn in 2014.

<p>which also say:</p>
<p>“NSA paid RSA Security $10 million in a secret deal to use Dual_EC_DRBG as the default in the RSA BSAFE cryptography library, which resulted in RSA Security becoming the most important distributor of the insecure algorithm”</p>

            <p>As for claims / evidence / proof that Tor crypto is insecure or even has a backdoor, I would suggest convincing an cryptography expert of that claim to lend it authority / credibility.</p>

        <title>Possible TOR backdoor</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The whonixTM wiki currently assumes that aside of known network attacks based on TOR and operational security fails of their users that TOR would hold against all kind of attacks except targeted (network) attacks and malicious relays. one thing that is not documented is security of TOR source code and their encryption choices.</p>
<p>in this thread I will discuss in detail a possible TOR backdoor in current TOR agent (and TOR Rust rewrite) that makes all TOR traffic same as unencrypted HTTP traffic.</p>
<p>before I start I recommend you read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ECDSA</a> and it’s proven <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Backdoors" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">backdoor</a><br>
while there are projects like SafeCurves they all focused on implementing simpler and less secure implementation in order to merely hopefully reduce chance of backdoor working, this approach wouldn’t work due fact they still use same bugged algorithm.</p>
<p>For longest time I thought TOR used RSA but as turns out it has been using ECDSA for quite a while now. I tried contacting TOR developers to see why they chose it over RSA but to no avail.<br>
so I consulted wiki and ECDSA apparently has a small improvement of speed when signing but RSA is still faster while encrypting which again most operations in TOR code are encrypting and not signing</p>
<p>And to add more nails to coffin both ECDSA and RSA fail when it comes to quantum computers, however, RSA is proven to be much more secure against traditional computers than ECDSA is.<br>
ECDSA is also a lot more complex algorithm wise which opens up for more backdoors and attacks in implementations aside from the main backdoor</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense why they would insert a bugged algorithm in a software that is used by a lot of important and vulnerable people<br>
TOR developers are not amateurs they have chosen ECDSA for a reason despite it’s proven backdoor</p>
<p>Someone like NSA who also been proven to spy on cables in sea would be able to capture TOR traffic and decipher them without running a single relay</p>
<p>I am not sure how this flew under the radar. I am not sure what whonixTM could do about this except the very laborious switching to another network. This is merely a discussion and not fear mongering post</p>
