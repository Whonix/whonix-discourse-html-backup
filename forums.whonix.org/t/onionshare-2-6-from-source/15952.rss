    <description>I somehow managed to install onionshare 2.6 from source into  kicksecure morphed debian 11 computer. ( I know this is whonix, thats my test cpu.)  What you get is instructions and scripts.

Be security minded with downloads.  What you will need is python3,
python3-pip. Next is poetry-python and add to PATH.  Next is tor-browser, but the script needs to updated to the latest version.  Then config or setup.

Will this install in whonix?  I have no idea.  Not versed enough in linux to say it will. Success in one thing does not translate into another.

Just saying thanks to the devs for this app.  Learning something new. :grinning:</description>
