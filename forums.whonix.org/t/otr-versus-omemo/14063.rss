    <description>- OTR is based on OpenPGP while OMEMO is &quot;homemade from scratch&quot;

- OTR is mainly for 1 to 1 chat while OMEMO mainly for group chat, the problem with group chat is key distribution and verifying is a lot less secure by nature than 1 to 1.

- OMEMO key verification is more complex and slips in comparing fingerprints by newbie users are very well possible, even advanced users can&#39;t properly verify fingerprint unless they meet in real life or send their fingerprint over another platform, OTR on other hands uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_millionaires&quot;&gt;Socialist millionaire protocol instead &lt;/a&gt; where users can set human readable questions to other party to verify their identity, aka key-fingerprint. TL;DR: `This feature makes it possible for users to verify the identity of the remote party and avoid a man-in-the-middle attack without the inconvenience of manually comparing public key fingerprints through an outside channel. `

- OMEMO wiki states it provides deniability which is not true, OMEMO does not provide good deniability &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html&quot;&gt; &quot;Deniability: X3DH is weakly offline deniable and provides no online deniability, as far as the research shows.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

- OMEMO wiki again falsely states perfect forward secrecy which again is totally false &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/dakez-popets18.pdf&quot;&gt;&quot;It has been demonstrated that OMEMO provides only weak forward secrecy (it protects the session key only once both parties complete the key exchange).&quot;&lt;/a&gt;

- OTR is more mature and a lot of popular projects are based on it &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol&quot;&gt;such as Signal&lt;/a&gt;

- OTR messages are smaller in size thus faster sending and receiving

- OTR does not save message history, while in OMEMO and clients that support OMEMO it is usually impossible/very hard to disable message history

There are probably other reasons that I missed, but those are most of major ones of why OTR is better than OMEMO

</aside>
<p>That is an XMPP protocol extension feature not really related to OMEMO per se. You can pick a service that doesn’t enable this extension.</p>
<p>Now for what you didn’t mention, OTRv3 is supposed to be cleanly designed when compared to OMEMO and how it handles secure file transfers, however only one modern client supports it (coyIM) and none on the mobile platforms. Giving the impression that OMEMO is unsecure and broken as your criticisms imply would be misleading and harmful for the adoption of privacy software.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not a cryptographer either but read Ian’s article.</p>
<p>It is not comparing OTR vs OMEMO, it is comparing secure messengers protocols and how to improve their deniability, specifically OTR and Signal protocol.</p>
<p>You cherry-picked OMEMO’s deniability flaws but left OTR’s out why?</p>
<p>3rd paragraph of the Introduction section of Ian’s article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, popular secure messaging protocols<br>
like OTR and Signal do not provide strong deniability.<br>
A protocol is strongly deniable if transcripts provide no<br>
evidence even if long-term key material is compromised<br>
(offline deniability) and no outsider can obtain evidence<br>
even if an insider interactively colludes with them (on-<br>
line deniability). The limited deniability of current se-<br>
cure messaging tools creates severe privacy weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you said this without pointing in the wiki where it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OMEMO wiki again falsely states perfect forward secrecy which again is totally false</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Anyway, the main thing I got from the article is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signal recently switched to a DAKE known as<br>
“Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman” (X3DH) [75] that im-<br>
proves forward secrecy but regresses to the deniability<br>
properties of OTR’s DAKE. Consequently, real-world<br>
deployments of “deniable” secure messaging protocols<br>
still lack strong deniability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Signal’s protocol (X3DH) improves forward secrecy and regresses on deniability when compared to OTR’s DAKE.</p>

</aside>
<p>I meant based on openPGP as in the concept, it is NOT openPGP nor does have same protocol but just based on it as in similar protocol in older versions of OTR. that point was not meant to make OTR look good by saying it’s based off something major but rather it shows the OTR authors expertises in that they didn’t attempt to re-invent the wheel early on</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Signal modified it to fit their goal of mobile application voice and video calls, group chats etc, they didn’t modify “the weakness” off it</p>
<p>point still stands that OTR is better than OMEMO in terms of forward secrecy and deniability as well as key exchanging.<br>
I am not saying OTR is best ever but when compared with OMEMO it’s pretty easy to see who wins</p>
