    <title>How to elegantly mitigate tor exit node http downgrade</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-elegantly-mitigate-tor-exit-node-http-downgrade/10464</link>
    <description>I heard recently there is a massive tor exit node http downgrade attack which malicious attackers control more theran twenty percent of tor exit node. I encountered this attack today and carelessly typed my sensitive credential into a http login page.I tried to mitigate the http downgrade attack but Qubes-whonix seems have some very weird mechanism makes doing it very difficult.

First I tried to ban all non-https connection in https everywhere, and it turned out work very well. The problem is I need to do this everytime in the disposable vm, which is pretty meaningless because I forget to do it most of the time. 

I tried to do this modification in the template browser, so refuse to connect http sites will be a default behavior of all spawned disposable vms, but first problem is the &quot;you cannot open torbrowser in the template&quot;. I commented out  in tb_allow_start_in_templatevm=true /etc/torbrowser/30_default, but torbrowser command in bash still refuses to start torbrowser and indicates &quot;Neither /var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser nor/var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/start-tor-browser nor /var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/start-tor-browser.desktop is executable.&quot; I tried to launch torbrowser in root but it refuses to launch as root. 

Fine, so I just chmod o+x the launcher,but use command torbrowser just comes with more permission problems. &quot;Browser/Data/Browser/profile.default/user.js&#39;: Permission denied
[ERROR] [torbrowser] /usr/bin/torbrowser script bug&quot;
&quot;touch: cannot touch &#39;/var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/slider-question-done&#39;: Permission denied
[ERROR] [torbrowser] /usr/bin/torbrowser script bug.&quot; 

After fixing these permission problems one by one running torbrowser comes with this bug &quot;[ERROR] [torbrowser] Tor Browser ended with non-zero (error) exit code!
Tor Browser was started with:
 /var/cache/tb-binary/.tb/tor-browser/Browser/start-tor-browser --allow-remote  .
Tor Browser exited with code: 126&quot;. Search this error code led to an ancient tor browser help ticket which is not helpful at all https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6493.

At this poing I messed up my whonix workstation and I need to reinstall my whonix template.
Ok I just uses template revert and got my whonix template back, and we can continue now.
 
I tried to edit the dvm template and changed the settings in torbrowser gui, but it seems like the spawned disp vms do not inherit 
settings from dvm torbrowser.</description>

            <p>BTW, Tor Browser/Firefox already includes a feature to block all HTTP connections without relying on a browser extension. Go to <code>about:config</code> and set <code>dom.security.https_only_mode</code> to <code>true</code>. This might be a better option for you as you can simply set it in a user.js file.</p>

            <p>How would you do that with Tor Browser on Debian? -&gt; Suggested to resolve as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle</a></p>
