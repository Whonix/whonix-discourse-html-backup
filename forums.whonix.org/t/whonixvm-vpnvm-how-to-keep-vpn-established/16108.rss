    <description>Hi,

I have a setup where I have a separated VM with a connection to a TCP VPN. Setup is whonixVM-&gt;vpnVM-&gt;User

I am seeing two issues with this setup. One is VPN disconnects very often. Second is while ping is  stable around 200ms sometimes I start getting 2kms or even 4kms and then get back suddenly to 200ms.

My question is, if is there any configuration I can put on whonix gateway to keep VPN connections longer as the gateway is ONLY used to connect to the VPN servers. I read in the manual there is a section that talks about this but was not able to see any specific config for this case.</description>

            <p>OK thanks, good to know! I though maybe the way it torify using socks in whonix was the cause for this issue and there were other known approaches, knowhing this I will take some research. THanks</p>
