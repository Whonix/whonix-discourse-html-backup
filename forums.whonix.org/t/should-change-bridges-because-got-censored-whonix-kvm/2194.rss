    <description>From my personal experience of whonix +obfs3 bridges (i use that 1,5 year now) i see that after some time,
 days to  weeks , depence from where i am connect , will become slow the tor , or even can&#39;t connect at all to a site. There is a simple solution to download new obfs3 and restart tor , then that keeps a lot of days.
So when the slow loading of sites or can&#39;t connect at all take place ,  that means the bridges got
 censored ? _**and so that means must change them because they stop to hide the fact of using tor?**_ 

That is a important question i see.
* I am not sure for something , but must keep in mind , i was use for some days the iceweasel browser inside whonix , with disabled proxy settings  , also it was installed the adobe flash player plugin on workstation and enabled on iceweasel , this is very bad i learned later , and i never use it from then, so maybe the obfs3 bridges got censored from that ? i don&#39;t know, I say maybe that it was responsible for slow down the loading of sites , i don&#39;t remember if that happens with tbb to, i am not sure .</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>For the time being, use obfs3, as obfs4 hasn’t been fully deployed: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en">https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en</a></p>

            <p>thank you for reply.<br>
So on latest whonix version i see the support of obfs4 , tor site gives obfs4 so its better from obfs3?<br>
i thing (not so clearly remebmer) i was read on sources from tor site and blog of it that obfs3 are more resistant to censor from obfs4 , litle paradoxial but use in china obfs3 and not obfs4 , why? is new and need more time for become more funcional? That i read before 5-8 months , maybe today the curent level is changed</p>

            <p>If you are able to connect to some website = bridge connectivity =<br>
functional.</p>
<p>Bridges are unrelated to websites saying “Tor users not welcome”, “spam<br>
host detected” etc.</p>
<p>Bridges over come censorship at the internet service provider level<br>
only. This is Tor network censorship.</p>
<p>Another form of “censorship” of Tor is when destination websites block<br>
access from the Tor network. That means from Tor exit relays. Changing<br>
bridges in that situation will 100% not work.</p>
