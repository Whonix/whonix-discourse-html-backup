    <title>curl calls between 2 worstations</title>

    <description>EDIT: removed

EDIT: Fixed, what a fool all it took was to use 
[ /usr/bin/curl.anondist-orig -v &quot;10.152.152.12&quot; ]
to bypass isolation. I wonder if there is a better way to do this still.


question was: 1 gateway, 2 workstations, how can a workstation communicate with another workstation using curl only though the local network?

Thank you</description>
