    <description>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy/Proxy_Settings_Method

Followed this with the intention of using a proxy addon (torbrowser -&gt; proxy -&gt; website), but it does not work, there is no connection to the internet when the proxy addon is enabled, so the instructions do not have any effect. 

The instructions appear to be out of date because they reference this file &quot;/etc/uwt.d/50_user.conf&quot; and this file &quot;/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf&quot; but neither file exists in whonix.


The titles for each section &quot; Remove proxy settings for [Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix] and [Remove proxy settings for APT repository files] imply that this section is not about allowing tor -&gt; proxy, but about removing the software updates ability to update over tor, which isnt related to anything in this section of the website.



edit: I re-read the initial disclaimer about TB not having any known solution for that method, so i went to the next method https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy/Proxyfier_Method

which states:

&gt; There is currently no tested, known to work solution for using Tor Browser with the Proxyfier Method. ..... Alternatively try the Proxy Settings Method.

Ok, so theres no solution for first method, and no solution for the second method, but it suggests to try the first method, and then goes on (in the 2nd method) explaining how to configure TB with it. Thats very confusing.</description>

<p>Indeed. That’s only 1 step. Not the full instructions how to do that. Not properly contextualized. The full steps aren’t easy but the context should be added to the wiki indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It was explained in chapter “Introduction” but maybe “Introduction” sounds like “never mind, skip this, show me the steps”. I’ve renamed that wiki chapter, improved it and generally added a better overview of steps required and their applicability.</p>

    This wiki template has an issue: 


And sometimes this wiki template is 

A) used to open existing files, and
B) sometimes to create new files.

Current woriding: 

Open file {{{filename}}} in an editor with root rights. 

Maybe future wording: 

Open or create file {{{filename}}} in an editor with root rights. 

But that seems a bit confusing. Not sure how to improve that yet. Maybe there’s an English word which could mean both “open existing file” and/or “create file if it does not exist yet”.…

<p>Thanks. I will update the wiki to reflect that.</p>
<p>To confirm:<br>
There’s currently no easy solution and none should be expected unless someone contributes.</p>
