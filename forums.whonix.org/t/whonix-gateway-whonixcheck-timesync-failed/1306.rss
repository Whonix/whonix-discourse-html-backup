    <description>I&#39;m getting an error when using whonix &amp; timesync.
whonixcheck error details : 
[code]ERROR: Tor Bootstrap Result: 
Whonixcheck gave up waiting after 90 seconds. 
Tor Circuit: not established 
Bootstrapping 5 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=5 TAG=conn_dir SUMMARY=&quot;Connecting to directory server&quot; WARNING=&quot;Connection timed out&quot; REASON=TIMEOUT COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore 
Possible issues: 
- Is the host&#39;s internet connection working? 
- Whonix-Gateway will need a few moments for bootstrapping the Tor network. 
- Do you live in a censored area? 
Recommendations: 
1) 
Shut down Whonix and try to get the Tor Browser Bundle from https://www.torproject.org working on your host. If you cannot get the Tor Browser Bundle to work, you will most certainly not get Whonix to work either. 
The Tor Browser Bundle is great for testing if you live in a censored area. If you need bridges for the Tor Browser Bundle, you will need them for Whonix as well. 
2) 
Try again: Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix Check 
or in Terminal: whonixcheck 
or in Terminal with debugging: bash -x whonixcheck --verbose 
3) 
Use arm, connection page two, to see if Tor is connected: 
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Arm
or in Terminal: arm[/code]

timesync error details :
[code]NFO: Whonix is produced independently of, with no guarantee from, The Tor Project. Whonix is experimental software. Do not rely on it for strong anonymity. https://www.whonix.org 
ERROR: Network Time Synchronization failed!!! 
SDWDATE_STATUS: RUNNING 
TIMESANITYCHECK_STATUS: Success 
Please report this bug! 
See logfile: tail -f -n 20 /var/log/sdwdate.log 
See status files: cd /var/run/sdwdate &amp;&amp; dir 
Try again: 
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Timesync 
or in Terminal: timesync
Last resort: manually set the clock! (In UTC!): 
sudo su 
date -s &quot;17 FEB 2012 24:00:00&quot; &amp;&amp; hwclock -w[/code]

How can I fix this ? I&#39;ve removed and re-imported whonix-gateway like 3 times and still getting this error. Please help me !!  ??? ???

EDIT: Seems that I don&#39;t have internet connection on whonix-gateway but my host is fine. Why is that happening?</description>

Just “DisableNetwork 0”?<br>
No extra modifications?</p>
<p>Whonix 11 will most likely be released today. Release announcement later. Unless you mind being the first, take this one:<br>

<p>Major changes are port of Whonix from being Debian wheezy (that is Debian oldstable) based to Debian jessie (that now is Debian stable) based. And port from sysvinit to systemd among other enhancements, see changelog below.</p>

<p>The log contains nothing interesting. Besides perhaps abstain from Tor reload. Use restart.</p>
<p>Also worth while to run…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve followed those instructions <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#No_network_inside_Whonix.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Troubleshooting#No_network_inside_Whonix.3F</a> .<br>
When I type route I get this</p>
<p><code>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         10.0.2.2        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0
10.0.2.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
10.152.128.0    *               255.255.192.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
</code><br>
but in above link it says that eth1 it should be associated with 192.168.0.0<br>
Maybe that’s the problem?</p>

            <p>I’m getting an error when using whonix &amp; timesync.<br>
whonixcheck error details :</p>
<p>[code]ERROR: Tor Bootstrap Result:<br>
Whonixcheck gave up waiting after 90 seconds.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Bootstrapping 5 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=5 TAG=conn_dir SUMMARY=“Connecting to directory server” WARNING=“Connection timed out” REASON=TIMEOUT COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore<br>
Possible issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the host’s internet connection working?</li>
<li>Whonix-Gateway will need a few moments for bootstrapping the Tor network.</li>
<li>Do you live in a censored area?<br>
Recommendations:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Shut down Whonix and try to get the Tor Browser Bundle from <a href="https://www.torproject.org" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.torproject.org</a> working on your host. If you cannot get the Tor Browser Bundle to work, you will most certainly not get Whonix to work either.<br>
The Tor Browser Bundle is great for testing if you live in a censored area. If you need bridges for the Tor Browser Bundle, you will need them for Whonix as well.<br>

Try again: Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Whonix Check<br>
or in Terminal: whonixcheck<br>
or in Terminal with debugging: bash -x whonixcheck --verbose<br>
3)<br>
Use arm, connection page two, to see if Tor is connected:<br>
Start menu -&gt; Applications -&gt; System -&gt; Arm<br>
or in Terminal: arm[/code]</p>
<p>timesync error details :</p>

<p>How can I fix this ? I’ve removed and re-imported whonix-gateway like 3 times and still getting this error. Please help me !!  ??? ???</p>
<p>EDIT: Seems that I don’t have internet connection on whonix-gateway but my host is fine. Why is that happening?</p>
