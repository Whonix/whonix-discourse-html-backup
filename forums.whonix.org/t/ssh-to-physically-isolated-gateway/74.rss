    <title>SSH to physically isolated Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/ssh-to-physically-isolated-gateway/74</link>
    <description>Please consider the following setup:

- Whonix Gateway on bare metal (physically isolated)
- Debian host + Virtualbox + Workstation VM
- Gateway + Workstation host LAN cable-connected

Do you see any security implications in connecting via SSH to the Gateway from either the Workstation host or the Workstation VM to manage it? How does SSH-connecting from Workstation host VS Workstation VM compare here from a security perspective? I guess it would be clever ;) to limit the SSH server to LAN.

Any thoughts on this? Looking forward to run the Gateway headless, most likely with WOL + GNU Screen.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>SSH from Workstation VM to Gateway is least secure. Workstation shouldnâ€™t have any control over the Gateway.</p>
<p>SSH from Workstation Host to Gateway is not as insecure as above. Still discouraged to weaken the isolation.</p>
<p>Most secure option is to connect to the Gateway using a non-Whonix computer or using the Gateway itself. Perhaps using a KVM switch.</p>
