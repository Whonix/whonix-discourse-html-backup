    <description>Some have asked about the use of docker as a security feature. Docker isn&#39;t meant to be, and currently is not, a security sandbox.

Anyone remember that website that said they were going to build a secure OS around containers? Last I checked they were just fancy graphics. A &quot;desktop CoreOS&quot; is a neat idea, but I have no clue how they&#39;re planning to implement it. 

Some people think that docker&#39;s increasing focus on security + kernel hardening will be enough. Only time can tell. Here&#39;s an interesting project that is trying to bring this to the desktop (for any distro):
http://subuser.org
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9F8uXFcVFA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSHxjDcvLFo

Think of it as a more powerful (and possibly easier to use) apparmor. We&#39;ll see. It&#39;s still in alpha right now and has a long way to go (with security at least).

So, two docker-related research TODOs:

- The place of subuser in Whonix
-- One very interesting use is having debian wheezy (or whatever) as your stable OS, but inside the container run a distro/userspace with more up-to-date repos. This might solve our &quot;what do we do when we want to have a recommended app preinstalled, but Debian only has an outdated, pre-forked, embarrassingly bad version (or none at all)&quot; problem.
- The suitability of docker to implement HulaHoop&#39;s &quot;one-click hidden service&quot; idea. (ie Wordpress docker image + with tor wiring; easily enabled/disabled/deleted/installed) 

Here is one users notes around docker security:

            <p>Looks interesting. That is useful for some really low end machines or a quick and dirty anonymous setup where no strong security is desired.</p>
<p>Should I reach out to him? Maybe we can adopt this as an official port with its script packaged into a .deb</p>
