    <title>One Guard Per App Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/one-guard-per-app-whonix/10735</link>
    <description>Hello.

Have a question in regards to the Increased Protection from Malicious Entry Guards: One Guard Per Internet Connected Application tactic in Whonix (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards#Guard_Fingerprinting)

I get the premise of the technique and I would like to implement it from the beginning while using Whonix.

My question is, if I am currently using a bridge to connect to Tor (using the same bridge every time), then is this method necessary at all? My understanding is that a bridge acts as an entry guard. So would this mean that I need to use a different bridge for each whonix gateway / whonix workstation combination, and make sure to change bridges every 120 days to simulate the default guard changing?

Thanks!</description>
