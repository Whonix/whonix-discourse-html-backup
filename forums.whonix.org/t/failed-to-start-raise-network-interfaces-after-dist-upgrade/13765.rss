    <title>Failed to start Raise network interfaces after dist-upgrade</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/failed-to-start-raise-network-interfaces-after-dist-upgrade/13765</link>
    <description>Hello. I have two Workstations. On the second Workstation I did `upgrade-nonroot` and installed a huge upgrade (it seems like it&#39;s a new version of Whonix).

But after installation completed, I&#39;ve done autoremove and then rebooted. And I see `ERROR: Failed to start Raise network interfaces` on boot screen. Even though this error appears, Internet works fine.

I have the following systemd log:

```
systemd[1]: Starting Raise network interfaces...
ifup[623]: RTNETLINK answers: File exists
ifup[578]: ifup: failed to bring up eth0
systemd[1]: networking.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=1/FAILURE
systemd[1]: networking.service: Failed with result &#39;exit-code&#39;.
systemd[1]: Failed to start Raise network interfaces.

```

I typed `ip a` and I noticed strange things: both 10.152.152.11 and 10.152.152.12 hardcoded adresses are binded:

```
inet 10.152.152.12/18 brd 10.152.191.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
inet 10.152.152.11/18 brd 10.152.191.255 scope global secondary eth0

```
**That is wrong!** 10.152.152.11 should belong only to the first Workstation, not to the second!!!

On `/etc/network/interfaces.d/30_non-qubes-whonix` I incremented address number

```
iface eth0 inet static
       ## Increment last octet of address
       ## on optional additional workstations.
       ## IP HARDCODED unfortunately.
       address 10.152.152.12
       netmask 255.255.192.0
       gateway 10.152.152.10

       ## Out commented.
       ## For what do we require the network and broadcast
       ## instances anyway?
       #network 192.168.0.0
       #broadcast 192.168.0.255

```

Well, I need help. How to solve the problem `Failed to start Raise network interfaces` ?</description>
