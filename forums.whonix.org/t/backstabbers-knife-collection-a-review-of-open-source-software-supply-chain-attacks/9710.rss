&gt; This paper presents a dataset of 174 malicious software packages that were used in real-world attacks on open source software supply chains, and which were distributed via the popular package repositories npm, PyPI, and RubyGems. Those packages, dating from November 2015 to November 2019, were manually collected and analyzed. The paper also presents two general attack trees to provide a structured overview about techniques to inject malicious code into the dependency tree of downstream users, and to execute such code at different times and under different conditions.</description>

<p>A software supply chain attack is characterized by the injection of malicious
code into a software package in order to compromise dependent systems further
down the chain. Recent years saw a number of supply chain attacks that leverage
