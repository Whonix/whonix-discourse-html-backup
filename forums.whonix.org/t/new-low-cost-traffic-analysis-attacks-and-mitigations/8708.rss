    <description>https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations

Interesting blogpost that provides some technical meat.

It has some client side suggestions for thwarting website fingerprinting. I will quote here and if anything useful is covered we can spin them off into their separate phabricator tickets.

&gt; Users: Do multiple things at once with your Tor client

Thankfully we get this for free with Whonix&#39;s design and thanks to stream isolation, safely at that.

We can do better by allowing users to [run their client as a bridge](https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service) we protect client traffic even more.
* What bridge type is ideal for Whonix GW? The easiest and quickest to implement? (Snowflake?)
* The GUI side option would be implemented as part of the anon-connection wizard.
* Does running your client as a bridge allow you to you yourself connect to a bridge before Tor? Does this provide double benefits? Needs research probably.

&gt; Mozilla/EFF/AdBlocker makers: Investigate Real Time Bidding ad networks

Blocking ads in Tor Browser turns out to be an anonymity benefit and not just to get rid of an annoyance. The Tor Project is taking a soft stance on this for pragmatic political reasons. If they block ads outright they risk Tor being blacklisted even more as retaliation.

Investigating ad networks for transparency is impossible unless you have an inside view of how they run their systems. Not gonna happen.

Tails hasn&#39;t given a fuck about ads or how blocking them makes their TBB differ from plain bundles since forever.  We should seriously find the best solution for blocking ads today if we agree to do it and convince Tails to switch to it if they have a different solution so we can blend into a slightly larger group.

We already chose to implement more secure options for our distro even if the cost is an identifiable network fingerprint.

&gt; Website Operators: Use v3 Onion Services

Yet one more reason to deprecate v2 and advise against them in documentation

The rest of the advice in the article doesn&#39;t apply to us.</description>

            <p>Turns out everything I thought I knew about snowflake and bridges was wrong:</p>

<p>The stuff running in the browser is proxy for the actual bridge that someone hosts. All bridge types need port forwarding.</p>
<p>You need custom code to mix client traffic and bridge traffic. The benefits are only for Onion services not clients.</p>
<p>In short we can safely scratch that off.</p>

<p>1App:1G just assumes the worst and doesn’t attempt to create cover traffic, but argues for putting your apps/eggs in different guard baskets.</p>
<p>He never argues against segregating website visits to different guards so we can assume this is just as valid. Worth asking once a dialog starts, but logically this advice is equivalent. The idea is to fragment a user’s anonymous traffic so no guard can construct a full picture if it decides to be evil.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know at all but I speculate it could be ~50-80% of Whonix users who only use the Tor Browser.</p>
<p>Also I don’t understand the distinction between application and activity here.</p>
<p>Common ground: Tor Browser is an application, OK. HexChat is another application OK. So far we agree. Now <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards#Increase_Protection_from_Malicious_Entry_Guards:_One_Guard_per_Application"> Increase Protection from Malicious Entry Guards: One Guard per Application</a> claims “Tor Browser and HexChat” should use different Tor circuits. Alright.</p>
<p>But why does it matter? From perspective of Tor, it’s all just TCP traffic. Tor doesn’t look if it is coming from Tor Browser or HexChat. That difference doesn’t exist anymore at that level. (Except these applications are configured to use different Tor SocksPorts.</p>
<p>Now reductio ad absurdum.</p>
<ul>
<li>User A): uses Tor Browser. HexChat, Thunderbird, OnionShare, Electrum, Monero -&gt; 6 applications -&gt; “you should use 6 different Tor entry guards”.</li>
<li>User B): uses Tor Browser for browsing, uses Tor Browser IRC Chat add-on or IRC webchat, uses cloud file send services, uses web wallet -&gt; 1 application -&gt; “you should use only 1 Tor entry guard”.</li>
</ul>
<p>As more and more functionality moves from previously standalone applications (HexChat, Thunderbird, …) into the browser the less the distinction between applications makes sense to me.</p>
<p>It would sound a lot more convincing to me to tell user B “use a different Tor entry guard per activity”. Why should users not use a different Tor entry guard by activity?</p>
<ul>
<li>[1] Considered true (?): use a different Tor entry guard per application</li>
<li>[2] Considered true (?): do not use a different Tor entry guard per activity</li>
</ul>
<p>How can [1] and [2]  be considered true at the same time?</p>

<p>Bridge, is designed to act as entry node (guard). There is no difference as far as number of hops with or without bridges when you connect to a given server. If there were three hops required to connect to given server without a bridge, there are three hops required to connect to a given server with a bridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given this info it means both node and user traffic is mixed and sent along to 2 remaining hops and malicious nodes would be none the wiser whose machine it came from. Bridge mode turns you into a participant in the Tor network and so regular connections from your node to other relays shouldn’t be discernible from your own. I need to confirm if a user’s individual connections are still using a guard of their own or not vs being a guard proper .</p>

            <p>Website fingerprinting meaning that an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that can observe an encrypted connection between a user and proxy (SSH, VPN or Tor) can still deduce what website is being used due to amount of traffic, timings, and whatnot.</p>
<p>In current configuration:</p>
<p>Alice -&gt; ISP -&gt; Tor Relay <code>A</code></p>
<p>Tor Relay <code>A</code> being the entry guard of Alice.</p>
<p>How would hosting a snowflake or any bridge help?</p>
<p>Bob  -&gt; Alice -&gt; ISP -&gt; Tor Relay <code>B</code></p>
<p>Bob is a bridge user. Alice is a bridge host.<br>
Tor Relay <code>B</code> being a relay which the Tor client of Bob has chosen.</p>
<p>How likely is it that Bob will also sent traffic to Tor Relay <code>A</code>? Because that would be required to obfuscate website fingerprinting. Am I right? How could it help that Alice isn’t only talking to Tor Relay <code>A</code> but also to Tor relay <code>B</code>? The traffic to Tor Relay <code>A</code> does not change. Website fingerprinting should still be possible in the same way.</p>
<p>Unless it is assumed that the whole internet uplink of Alice gets so busy that its connection to Tor Relay <code>A</code> suffers? That would mean that this works best of users with slower rather than faster uplinks?</p>
<p>Or is assumed that so many users use snowflake bridges that some snowflake bridge user would connect to Tor Relay <code>A</code> too?</p>
<p>Quote <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations">https://blog.torproject.org/new-low-cost-traffic-analysis-attacks-mitigations</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A similar argument can be made for mixing your client traffic with your own Tor Relay or Tor Bridge that you run, but that is <a href="https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service">very tricky to do correctly</a> for it to actually help.</p>

<p>It links to <a href="https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service">https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service</a> which seems to try to help onion services. Seems rather hard to grasp indeed. Doesn’t sound like “just run a snowflake bridge, done”.</p>
<p>Run the snowflake bridge under the same Tor process? Or a separate Tor process?</p>
<p>I would understand <a href="https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service">https://github.com/mikeperry-tor/vanguards/blob/master/README_SECURITY.md#the-best-way-to-run-tor-relays-or-bridges-with-your-service</a> as: run a (snowflake) bridge as a separate Tor process and then configure the system Tor process to use your own snowflake bridge? But wouldn’t that also reduce the number of Tor relays being used from <code>3</code> to <code>2</code>?</p>

<p>Using a browser based solution has several technical challenges:</p>

<li>install a browser (very doable)</li>

<li>start the browser (here it starts getting complicated [1])</li>
<li>install snowflake addon [2]</li>

<li>stop the browser</li>
<li>update snowflake addon [4]</li>
</ul>
<p>[1] Start the browser for real? So the user can really see it? Usability issue. Users would probably use the browser for other things too. Launching the browser for real requires X to be fully ready. Or maybe start the browser hidden using a simulated X environment using xpra or something.</p>

<p>It might be possible to solve all of this but that solution would be more complex and more fragile than not needing to interact with any GUI to start with.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://phabricator.whonix.org/T118">make TBB usable as “system Tor”, so latest pluggable transports and the tor-launcher graphical user interface can be used in Whonix</a></p>
<p>Therefore, any solution that does not involve using an GUI (except for an option for users to enable hosting a bridge in ACW) is best avoided. Therefore:</p>

            <p>AFAIK the Snowflake WebExtension addon implements both client and server functionality and has already been rolled out.[1] In theory one should be able to interact with the addon using the same technique mentioned in the documentation you linked - may have to ask.</p>
<p>It is available in alpha TBB releases.[2]</p>
<p>Once we resolve the secure way to obtain the code it will be a matter of figuring out how to implement TBB as Tor safely on the GW.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Integration with Tor Browser</p>
<p>2018-11-30: Snowflake is included in ​alpha releases of Tor Browser for GNU/Linux and macOS. Not Windows yet.</p>
<p>Further integration of Snowflake into Tor Browser is being tracked at ticket <span class="hashtag">#19001</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a Catch-22. Little usage because of bugs and bugs because not widely used/tested. Either way one has to break the cycle  at some point by just deploying it out there and exposing it to more users. That way there will be more people connecting to users running the server, providing them with cover traffic.</p>
<p>Snowflake is the decentralized meek of the future. The sheer number of bridges and their dynamic nature makes it much harder to discover and block. It’s only a matter of time before it is endorsed as the top circumvention transport.</p>

            <p>Thanks for explaining. We have a good rationale now.</p>
<p>Yes, making bridge users host a bridge too make not be wise without consulting Tor Project first. Therefore this would not be a good default for all users (including bridge users).</p>
<p>This might have been a good default for public Tor network (non-bridge) users but you listed good points why this is not a good default for these users either.</p>
<p>How to run a snowflake bridge on Debian? We probably need to run snowflake standalone.

<p>There are no premade, signed packages / binaries yet for snowflake server?</p>
<p>Are you sure snowflake servers (bridges) would receive a continuous amount of traffic? Because, if nobody is using the bridge, it wouldn’t provide any benefit for the purpose of the issue of this forum thread, I suppose?</p>

<p>Some of our users might be in censored areas themselves so them being a bridge makes little sense. It’s also unclear how both being and using a bridge affects anonymity.

<p>meek could never work for this as it needs a CDN Serverside. For traffic mixing to work you need a bridge transport that makes <em>you</em> the server.</p>
<p>We asked TPO about making everybody run a snowflake (not meek) bridge and we concluded it was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Offtopic: The fact that meek uses PRISM partner companies probably makes traffic analysis worse, but it’s a trade-off for better circumvention.</p>

            <p>We certainly shouldn’t make everyone use a snowflake bridge by default without asking upstream, The Tor Project.</p>
<p>I faintly remember we asking The Tor Project if we could make everyone use the <code>meek</code> pluggable transport by default (or as an automatic fallback in case of connectivity issues)? The answer was “no, please don’t, as domain fronting produces actual costs”.</p>
<p>Also meek is probably slower? And less reliable connection stability? Switching a whole distribution to be using it by default is quite a change.</p>

<p>It does. I think they don’t/can’t take usage models like the 1G/App into consideration since a very small number of users will run Tor that way. So the next best thing is to try to confuse the malicious guard by pumping in different types of traffic. So if we had to rate the from more to less effectiveness, then:</p>
<p>1 G/App &gt; Multiple Traffic thru 1 G &gt; One type of traffic thru 1 G</p>

<p>I see so they agree about the principle, but not the implementation. (upstream curation vs addon). Not a fan of security theater and this seems to be the case.</p>
<p>Although in the ticket about uBlockOrigin , <code>arthuredelstein</code> discusses they were working on shipping an adblocker that’s turned off by default and need to work a few things out for performance. The quote in the manual above may be outdated and was never changed to reflect reality. It was written before uBlock existed which is superior to all these options.</p>

</aside>
<p>The 0.1% of ad networks that slip thru is not a strong argument against the benefits of blocking all the rest. We can think of the whole approach as on a spectrum vs being absolute. fpcentral - a site designed specifically for TBB fingerprint testing should answer these questions.</p>

<p>With all due respect, pseudonymity becomes a liability over time and any mistake would uncover all a user’s past activities while anonymity provides forward secrecy of sorts.

<strong>No filters</strong> Site-specific or filter-based addons such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/" rel="nofollow noopener">AdBlock Plus</a>, <a href="https://requestpolicy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Request Policy</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/about-ghostery/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ghostery</a>, <a href="http://priv3.icsi.berkeley.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener">Priv3</a>, and <a href="https://sharemenot.cs.washington.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener">Sharemenot</a> are to be avoided. We believe that these addons do not add any real privacy to a proper <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#Implementation" rel="nofollow noopener">implementation</a> of the above <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy" rel="nofollow noopener">privacy requirements</a>, and that development efforts should be focused on general solutions that prevent tracking by all third parties, rather than a list of specific URLs or hosts. Implementing filter-based blocking directly into the browser, such as done with <a href="https://ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2015/W2SP/papers/W2SP_2015_submission_32.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> Firefox’ Tracking Protection</a>, does not alleviate the concerns mentioned in the previous paragraph. There is still just a list containing specific URLs and hosts which, in this case, are <a href="https://services.disconnect.me/disconnect-plaintext.json" rel="nofollow noopener"> assembled</a> by <a href="https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection" rel="nofollow noopener"> Disconnect</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-exceptions" rel="nofollow noopener">adapted</a> by Mozilla. Trying to resort to <a href="https://jonathanmayer.org/papers_data/bau13.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filter methods based on machine learning</a> does not solve the problem either: they don’t provide a general solution to the tracking problem as they are working probabilistically. Even with a precision rate at 99% and a false positive rate at 0.1% trackers would be missed and sites would be wrongly blocked. Filter-based solutions in general can also introduce strange breakage and cause usability nightmares. For instance, there is a trend to observe that websites start <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2017/papers/issue3/paper25-2017-3-source.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> detecting filer extensions and block access to content</a> on them. Coping with this fallout easily leads to just <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/shavar-list-exceptions" rel="nofollow noopener">whitelisting </a> the affected domains, hoping that this helps, defeating the purpose of the filter in the first place. Filters will also fail to do their job if an adversary simply registers a new domain or <a href="https://ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2015/W2SP/papers/W2SP_2015_submission_24.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener"> creates a new URL path</a>. Worse still, the unique filter sets that each user creates or installs will provide a wealth of fingerprinting targets. As a general matter, we are also generally opposed to shipping an always-on Ad blocker with Tor Browser. We feel that this would damage our credibility in terms of demonstrating that we are providing privacy through a sound design alone, as well as damage the acceptance of Tor users by sites that support themselves through advertising revenue. Users are free to install these addons if they wish, but doing so is not recommended, as it will alter the browser request fingerprint.</li>

<p>Problem is that it is an “inside” Tor Browser issue. Once Tor Browser was inside modified, all Tor Browser issues would be blamed on Whonix. Similar to <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-tor-browser-first-startup-popup-to-ask-whether-security-slider-should-be-set-to-safest/7591" class="inline-onebox">add Tor Browser first startup popup to ask whether security slider should be set to safest</a></p>
<p>“Inside” Tor Browser modifications are fragile as <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/add-tor-browser-first-startup-popup-to-ask-whether-security-slider-should-be-set-to-safest/7591" class="inline-onebox">add Tor Browser first startup popup to ask whether security slider should be set to safest</a> has shown. Tails cannot be compared much? Whonix / Tor Browser can be upgraded anytime. Tails not so much since its mostly release based updated?</p>

<p>Maxim Kammerer, developer of Liberté Linux <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot#cite_note-3" rel="nofollow noopener">[3]</a>, has disparate ideas on anonymity and pseudonymity which should not be withheld from the reader: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot#cite_note-4" rel="nofollow noopener">[4]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have not seen a compelling argument for anonymity, as opposed to pseudonymity. Enlarging anonymity sets is something that Tor developers do in order to publish incremental papers and justify funding. Most users only need to be pseudonymous, where their location is hidden. Having a unique browser does not magically uncover user’s location, if that user does not use that browser for non-pseudonymous activities. Having good browser header results on anonymity checkers equally does not mean much, because there are many ways to uncover more client details (e.g., via Javascript oddities).</p>

<p>Not in scope. The idea here is to mix traffic from more people into the same node to provide cover for a user’s activities. What you’re suggesting is something similar to <code>ad nauseaum</code> which would load the Tor network without any real benefit since spoofed activity is easily filtered for especially for someone who does website fingerprinting.</p>

<p>Default ad blocking will never happen for the reasons mentioned. Tails has been doing it for years and it is worth considering now that ads sabotage anonymity.</p>

</aside>
<p>Something like snowflake is trivial to run. Just keep your browser open for the addon to work. The other transports require NAT holepunching and just a bunch more steps that won’t be feasible on some networks or for all users’ skill levels.</p>

<p>There’s a big difference between maybe being identified as a Whonix user via some advanced attack and definitely being identified by a Whonix user via any random website. It’s really easy to detect if ads are being blocked.</p>
