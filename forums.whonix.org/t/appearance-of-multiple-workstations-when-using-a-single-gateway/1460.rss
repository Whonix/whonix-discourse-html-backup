    <title>Appearance of multiple workstations when using a single gateway?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/appearance-of-multiple-workstations-when-using-a-single-gateway/1460</link>
    <description>If one were to use a single gateway for more than one workstation, wouldn&#39;t that compromise the anyonymity of both workstations? If the technical data for both workstations is being tunneled through a single gateway, what does each workstation look like to the outside world once it&#39;s gone through the gateway? Do both workstations appear as one single entity to the outside world (due to their being tunneled through the same gateway) or do the two workstation&#39;s identities appear distinct?

So this is a question of identity correlation, but it is also a question of one identity possibly contaminating another.</description>
