    <title>Installing Softether VPN</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/installing-softether-vpn/917</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to install Softether VPN as an additional level of security. [url=https://www.softether.org/]https://www.softether.org/[/url]

It supports Linux but I&#39;m not real familiar with creating the install package: [url=https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/7._Installing_SoftEther_VPN_Server/7.3_Install_on_Linux_and_Initial_Configurations]https://www.softether.org/4-docs/1-manual/7._Installing_SoftEther_VPN_Server/7.3_Install_on_Linux_and_Initial_Configurations[/url]

Specifically the &quot;make&quot; command is failing. Any help appreciated.</description>

            <p>-glad to hear that they have worldwide servers (when i have tried it b4 there was only 2 countries but with different signals strength)</p>
<p>-openvpn depends on the private tunnel so here is their website:-</p>
<p><a href="https://www.privatetunnel.com/index.php/price.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.privatetunnel.com/index.php/price.html</a></p>
<p>and i think the first free choice its enough for surfing (except if u have many activities then u should pay)</p>
<p>-its not that i want to know what u gonna do with it to interfere with ur privacy , but i was asking to c if u know the reality of vpns privacy calimers or not (like they r saving ur logs or not, or is it really not leakable?..etc). because i have checked many developers comments and the summary of them that there is no 100% guaranteed safe vpn , even if there is then is it really going to hide ur activities while using tor with no leaks ? (these questions r debatable and no 100% surety out yet that i have found).</p>
<p>^^^ read/listen to edward snowden documents/lectures and c how the governments agencies collecting ppl informations around the world (many vpn companies r compromised)</p>
<p>and here is a list from torrentfreak u can know how the companies did respond to their questions:-</p>

            <p>Ah, but you could maybe jump through some hoops and get his compiled. But that’s more of a general Linux, perhaps Debian challenge. Whonix won’t stand in your way because it most likely adds no extra challenges to it.</p>

 Parkinson's law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that members of an organization give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bike shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more ...</p>

            <p>did u read the supported linux distros on the softether website??</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]<span class="bbcode-b">Red Hat Enterprise Linux<br>
Fedora<br>
CentOS</span>[/glow]</p>
<p>and whonix is based on debian (im sure u have read that more than 10 times before u reached here)</p>
<p>also since we r friends in noobness (im a user and u r a user) i would prefer to read</p>
<p>“How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a></p>
<p>(im sure u gonna benefits from the advises there and dont look at the name of it because ur question is not stupid but its not for whonix to solve)</p>
<p>also my other advise would be regarding softether, it dont advise u to use it but use another one because its vpn servers r 2 far away (japan and korea) and its highly not recommended with tor because i used it on my windows pc with tor and the software turned off and on more than usual vpn do when browsing.</p>
<p>alternatives =&gt; openvpn (its also free)</p>
<p>but b4 even using vpn ,the question who u r hiding urself from ? from gov. or its general anonymity ? did u know also the vpn turned off and on while u r browsing (its general problem for all vpns) ? (the solvation of this problem u need to use netcat with vpn)</p>
<p>i know it sound u need to get many articles to read and stuff to do in order to get the sufficient anonymity while using vpn. but that is the truth nothing come without tiredness</p>
<p>thnx for asking whonix , feel free to ask more (but read the article b4 u ask <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ).</p>
