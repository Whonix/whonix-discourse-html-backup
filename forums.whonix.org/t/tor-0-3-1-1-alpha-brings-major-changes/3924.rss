    <title>Tor 0.3.1.1 alpha brings major changes</title>

    <description>Some very exciting features in the Tor 0.3.1.1 alpha. Besides supporting Rust components and efficient SHA-3 use, the long awaited netflow padding has made a grand entrance:

&gt; Major features (traffic analysis resistance):
&gt;     - Connections between clients and relays now send a padding cell in
&gt;       each direction every 1.5 to 9.5 seconds (tunable via consensus
&gt;       parameters). This padding will not resist specialized
&gt;       eavesdroppers, but it should be enough to make many ISPs&#39; routine
&gt;       network flow logging less useful in traffic analysis against
&gt;       Tor users.

&gt;       Padding is negotiated using Tor&#39;s link protocol, so both relays
&gt;       and clients must upgrade for this to take effect. Clients may
&gt;       still send padding despite the relay&#39;s version by setting
&gt;       ConnectionPadding 1 in torrc, and may disable padding by setting
&gt;       ConnectionPadding 0 in torrc. Padding may be minimized for mobile
&gt;       users with the torrc option ReducedConnectionPadding. Implements
&gt;       Proposal 251 and Section 2 of Proposal 254; closes ticket 16861.
&gt;     - Relays will publish 24 hour totals of padding and non-padding cell
&gt;       counts to their extra-info descriptors, unless PaddingStatistics 0
&gt;       is set in torrc. These 24 hour totals are also rounded to
&gt;       multiples of 10000.
