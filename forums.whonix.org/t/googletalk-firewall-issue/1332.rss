    <title>GoogleTalk Firewall Issue</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/googletalk-firewall-issue/1332</link>
    <description>Using googletalk plugin in Iceweasel to make voice calls in standard VirtualBox Whonix setup works fine.
Same plugin in Whonix-Qubes causes calls to drop after 2 mins (exactly).

Usually, the plugin says &quot;Calling...&quot; until connected, then it switches to &quot;In Call...&quot;
But in Whonix-Qubes, it stays on &quot;Calling&quot; for 2 mins and then drops the call because it thinks that no connection was made. Error: &quot;Call failed to connect because the number was unreachable.&quot; However, the call goes through normally and the audio is fine.

I found this regarding GoogleTalk Call Signaling:
https://developers.google.com/talk/call_signaling?hl=en
but I don&#39;t understand any of it. What is different in Whonix-Qubes vs Standard Whonix that is causing the call signaling to fail?</description>

            <p>Part2: probably unrelated but …</p>
<p>I set up tor -&gt; vpn to tunnel udp traffic and tried to get linphone/jitsi to work.<br>
udp is tunneling ok because sign-in works<br>
calls connect but again no rtp stream for audio.<br>
haven’t tested recently but it did work in the past using virtualbox whonix.<br>
something is blocking rtp in whonix-qubes and why should any firewall matter if everything is tunneling through vpn on the workstation?</p>
