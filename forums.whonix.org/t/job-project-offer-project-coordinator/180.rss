You’ll need to be comfortable in this environment! We coordinate via IRC, Instant Messaging, email, phone and video chats, bug trackers and forum.

– We only write free and open source software, and we don’t believe in software patents.&lt;/p&gt;

– Link to a sample of projects you’ve coordinated in the past that you’re allowed to show us.

– Add your salary expectation.
