    <title>Enable Docker&#39;s containers to communicate in Whonix Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/enable-dockers-containers-to-communicate-in-whonix-workstation/7513</link>
    <description>Hi,

I want to run a hidden service in Whonix and to isolate the webserver and php I want to configure them inside docker containers. I installed Docker and configured nginx, php and both containers are up and running. I also can access the nginx server through the hidden service generated in the gateway (I followed the official whonix guide to configure it) but the nginx can&#39;t access the php container, I tested the communication between them using ping but there isn&#39;t any communication between those containers. The same docker file is working in Debian 9 without problems so I guess that maybe I need to add something in the firewall to allow the private internal address of containers. I though that this will can be a good idea to improve whonix security or anonimity because even if there is any leak, it will be a docker private ip and having the code isolated in containers I think that&#39;s better. I am not an expert in Docker but I am very noob using firewall and iptables so I need some help to get that configuration working.

Best Regards</description>

<p>This discussion assumes local execution ability. In that case for example installed list of packages is unique to Whonix, fonts, and whatnot.

<p>About Bublewrap I will check it but it is the first time that I hear it. I have some knowledges about lxc and firejail; I tried to build it using both but it was a bit difficult.</p>

<p>The IP won’t help much as it is only a local IP address. This can’t be used for anything unless the attacker is connected to the same network as you.</p>
<p>It will improve security though and would be a good idea although I think other solutions like Firejail and Bubblewrap would be better.</p>
