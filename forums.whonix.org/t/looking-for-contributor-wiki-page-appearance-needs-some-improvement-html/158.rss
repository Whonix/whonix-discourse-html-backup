    <description>Not written in stone, means, we can discuss this further.

1)
Whonix&#39;s documentation table of contents (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation) does not look well.

It could need markup changes to look more pretty. Here is an example that looks more pretty:
https://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/help/index.html

This can be done with some html, div etc inside the wiki markup. Just hit the edit button in the wiki.

2)
Whonix&#39;s Contribiute page (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Contribute) does not look well.

A table formatted look would be more pretty.

(For example, the Donate page (https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Donate) is already using such tables.)

Here is a contribute page that looks better:
https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html

Whonix could also use such icons. Colored ones would be preferred, though. We don&#39;t have to create such icons. We can use ones, that are under Free (as in speech) licenses (FSF approved). [If you&#39;re interested, we can sort out the licensing here. No big deal.]</description>
