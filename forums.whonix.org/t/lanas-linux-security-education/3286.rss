IF using XFCE. If not lightdm... What is the most XFCEish login manager? It doesn&#39;t have its own login manager? The login manager required for Whonix apparently does not really matter. Only feature so far that seems required:
a config file that can be dropped into a .d folder to enable auto login for user user (good usability feature for Whonix in VMs)
So perhaps xdm or lxdm? Don&#39;t know yet if they support that feature. TODO: research

LightDM or KDM is my choice.

Well, Arch has a quite extensive list of all the Display Managers we could use: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager#List_of_display_managers
According to it, both XDM and LXDM offer a form of passwordless/auto login.
IF using XFCE. If not lightdm...
Sorry, might have missed something but why was using LightDM with XFCE discarded?

LXDM, XDM, &quot;NODM&quot;...

Another topic we should look at is wayland support. GNOME and KDE are forerunners in that respect. XFCE is still on the way to porting to GTK3 which it needs for any basic wayland support. GTK4 is being planned right now. So they are way behind.
Wayland means getting rid of a huge security hole that is X. At least in Stretch X doesn&#39;t run as root anymore but still

<p>No. NO! <em><strong>NO!!!</strong></em> If you’d know what you are talking about you’d know that’s wrong. The biggest contributor to the kernel are companies like Intel, Red Hat, IBM who fund their employees to work and improve the kernel as well as look for security issues constantly. Those three companies contributions already make up 23% of all changes/additions. The people these companies hire are highly trained and very well educated professionals who know more about the things they do then the people which call themselfes “security experts”.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if “anyone” could “embed a backdoor straight into the Linux kernel” then tomorrow your Internet and bank account would stop working because those systems all need the kernel to be as safe as possible.

<p>I’m sorry but there is so much wrong with that statement that I don’t know where to start.</p>
<p>Even if anything you just said would be true, why would an OS for servers (which host critical infrastructure for the web like root DNS, banking, software agents, etc) be less secure then one for “client”? That doesn’t make any sense. Severs  would need MORE security in EVERY way, not less.</p>
<p>Also, why would the Linux kernel be a “security hole”? Do you know what it does? Do you know how it compares to the Windows NT kernel or the UNIX kernel?</p>
