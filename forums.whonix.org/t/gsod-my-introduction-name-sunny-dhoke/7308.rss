    <description>Hello,
My name is Sunny Dhoke and I&#39;m currently 3rd year CSE student. I would like to be part of Documentation project: **Project Name:** Refactor Whonix ™ in VirtualBox Tutorial for First-time Linux Users
I&#39;m a security enthusiast so I know how difficult it can get to istall anything in a sandbox software like VirtualBox or VMware. I&#39;m very much aware about the use cases and pit falls of using these softwares. 
This is my introduction and looking forward to this project&#39;s mentor guidance.
Thanks.
Peace out.
PS: Since this is my first introduction. I&#39;m sorry if I was ot supposed to create a topic.</description>

            <p>Hi <code>Sunny</code></p>
<p>Welcome to the Whonix forum! Great to see interest in Whonix in VirtualBox for first time linux users. This would be a big help to the project since many new Linux users struggle when they transition from Windows.  To start, If you haven’t already, this video is definitely worth the hour.</p>
