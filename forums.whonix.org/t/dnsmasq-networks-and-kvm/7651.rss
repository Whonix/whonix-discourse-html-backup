    <title>dnsmasq, networks, and kvm</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/dnsmasq-networks-and-kvm/7651</link>
    <description>in var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq what should be included in this folder? i searched by couldnt find much. 

i have:

external.addnhosts
external.conf
external.hostsfile
virbr1.macs
virbr2.macs

the thing is some of the files were &quot;last modified&quot; on days that i did not use libvirt at all. 

when i open the files, they are pretty much empty. one shows an autoconfig file. 

I normally wouldnt even look in here, but today i tried to open whonix, but got something like &quot;error&quot;broken pipe&quot;&quot;. i restarted my machine and whonix booted up fine without the error. 

any thoughts? im on a fedora host</description>

            <p>Could be  a SELinux problem? The modification could have happened because the daemon was updated that day.</p>

            <p>I am trying to gain understanding. I am used to tails where it is set it and forget it - upgrade when the prompt tells you to upgrade. i read through all the documentation here and learned a lot and made the switch.</p>
<p>so i guess what i am trying to accomplish is to figure out what this “error: failed something broken pipe” is.</p>
<p>trying to figure it out, i looked at all of the folders. the dnsmasq caught my attention because they were “last modified” on a day i know i did not open whonix at all.</p>
<p>i followed the directions step by step and everything worked perfectly until this.</p>
<p>it is of note that it did the same thing again today. i restart my machine and then it opens up fine.</p>
<p>i did not touch or edit any files at all. i was just in the file manager clicking through them and looking at them. i wouldnt trust myself at all to edit any of these files</p>

            <p>I don’t know what you’re trying to accomplish here.</p>
<p>You really shouldn’t mess with the libvirt dnsmasq config so you don’t cause unknown security problems.</p>
