    <title>Host offline, but guest has internet?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/host-offline-but-guest-has-internet/10116</link>
    <description>Noticed I couldnt access internet on my host, but my whonix guest has internet access just fine. Was wondering what the possible causes could be and whether this suggests a security concern? I thought vbox with NAT networking relied on the host adapter?</description>

<p>I don’t see any as long as you don’t modify any VM settings on the host.<br>
If Whonix-Workstation is started even while Whonix-Gateway is powered off / not even on the hard drive there is no risk of clearnet connections. Host internet working or not is irrelevant too.</p>

            <p>Hi I don’t need help troubleshooting connectivity on the host as that was already fixed with a restart. Theres many forums like virtualbox, linux, networking, or distro this post could go on, and each forum would likely direct me to the others to ask this question. For instance, I could ask on the vbox forums, but they would be less familiar with the actual setup of whonix. So ignore the possible causes than: what could be the security concerns of a workstation getting internet when the host doesnt? Thanks!</p>
