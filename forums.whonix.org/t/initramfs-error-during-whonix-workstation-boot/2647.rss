    <description>Sorry for copying and paste the same topic from Support forum section. Just want to get help as soon as possible.

Hi my friends,  recently I faced very strange 
boot error, in process of whonix workstation boot, at the point 
[6.875383] usbhid: USB HID core drive I get a very strange message - 
initramfs. I use the Virtual box, and my version of Whonix is 
12.0.0.3.2, I&#39;ve updated it few times after the release date and 
actually not pretty sure about the true version. 

So anyway, my system is encrypted and I just don&#39;t know how to fix that problem? Anyone can help me please? 

Or, if it&#39;s not possible to solve is there any way I can get my files back from this VM and place them into main system?</description>
