    <title>Can&#39;t configure Ubuntu with Whonix-Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/cant-configure-ubuntu-with-whonix-gateway/7199</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have VirtualBox
I would like to make configuration Lubuntu instead of Whonix-Workstation with Whonix-Gateway.
I have used tutorial from your site [Whonix-GNU/Linux-Workstation](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems#Easy_2)
I did:
    sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
then I put:
    auto enp0s3
    #iface enp0s3 inet dhcp
    iface enp0s3 inet static
    address 10.152.152.12
    netmask 255.255.192.0
    gateway 10.152.152.10

then from resolv.conf I have deleted everything and put:
`nameserver 10.152.152.10`

Unfortunately it does not work. I have tried with Ubuntu/Lubuntu/Xubuntu. In Xubuntu nameserver changes every restart to default. In Lubuntu after restart everything stays the same as I have edit it but I have no internet connection. Whonix Gateway is running but my Linux Lubuntu is not working.
I have also tried [this tutorial from github](https://github.com/moneroexamples/xubuntu-vm-through-whonix-gateway/blob/master/README.md) for Xubuntu but it does not work for me

I would be thankful for any help</description>

            <p>Maybe a stupid question, but did you make sure that the Lubuntu VM is using the Whonix network?<br>
Did you first test if a Whonix-Workstation works with your Whonix-Gateway? Is the Whonix-Gateway working correctly? Be aware that on first boot Tor must be activated on the Whonix-Gateway (you have a few settings messages that you must go through in order for the Gateway to work).<br>
Also, did you make sure that on the Lubuntu VM the Whonix network is <code>enp0s3</code>? What does the command <code>ip a</code> return on the Lubuntu VM?</p>
