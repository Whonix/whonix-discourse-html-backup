    <title>Encountering Fatal Build Errors in VM Whonix-Workstation Build (8.2)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/encountering-fatal-build-errors-in-vm-whonix-workstation-build-8-2/466</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working on getting bare metal build instructions working inside of a HVM/VM build.

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation/8#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_on_Hardware_.28RECOMMENDED.29

While this is for my Qubes work, I don&#39;t think the issue is Qubes-specific because I&#39;m getting the same fatal build errors in VirtualBox.

With the exception of a couple minor errors in the &quot;80_cleanup&quot; script, which I can bypass with &quot;c + enter&quot;,  the Whonix-Gateway build goes through and the system works fine.

The fatal errors occur when building the Whonix-Workstation, in the &quot;1700_install-meta-packages&quot; script.

The first error I encounter can be seemingly bypassed with the &quot;c + enter&quot; command.

Then, right after the first error, a second error prompts itself. I can input the &quot;c + enter&quot; command to ignore and continue on, but after doing so the entire build process errors out and quits back to a normal terminal prompt.

Here is the end of the &quot;log-bare-metal&quot; file where it errors out on the Whonix-Workstation build:

<p>Agreed. But if this works on a personal machine, we could also release a new git tag. The troublesome part is just the maintenance burden. Posting a new blog post about this minor update?

</aside>
<p>Yeah, I guess I have a natural symmetry-based tendency to want to avoid supporting two different versions at once between binary images and source code. Although, if it becomes necessary to keep the source code buildable without a better workaround, then I’d be fine with this.</p>
<p>If we were to do this, as far as the publishing you mentioned, I don’t mind either way. I’d obviously update the Qubes page. The recommended git tag on the general build docs might want to be updated too (if applicable beyond Qubes, so that it would work again for people). Beyond that, whatever you feel like doing or not doing with announcements and explanations is fine with me.</p>

<p>I haven’t been able to dive into the Whonix source code yet. At some point I plan to. Initially for security review (although I’m not a true expert at code-level security). Then at some point I’ll start getting a sense of how the Whonix code is structured and flows, and maybe be able to help improve upon it.</p>

<p>Yes, while I personally like building Whonix from source code, I could see this [installing on top of a Debian OS using Whonix APT repo option] being a useful alternative that sits kind of “between” a monolithic binary image download and installing from git source code.</p>

<p>For what its worth, I am now testing this inside of Qubes. When I run into problems in Qubes, I do a baseline test in VirtualBox to figure out if it is Qubes-specific or not. So, while not the level of a dedicated maintainer for VB or PI, hopefully I will now be able to at least offer some greater exposure to bugs that would arise here with --install-to-root.</p>

<p>Yes. This will be cool. I had similar thoughts, about a month ago, for the concept of an integrated Download page/explanation, since Whonix has expanded to greater customization and modularity for how it can be implemented by people.</p>

            <p>Whoops, I spoke too soon…</p>
<p>Now strangely I’m encountering another fatal build error for Whonix-Gateway 8.2 and Whonix-Workstation 8.2 in Qubes, involving yet another package dependency (liblwres80).</p>
<p>With the Whonix 9 release seemingly coming right around the corner now, and a number of these build issues potentially taken care of, it’s probably wiser to drop my efforts with 8.2 build support and just focus on preparing and moving everything to Qubes + Whonix 9.</p>
<p>If it’s now down to a matter of a few weeks or less for Whonix 9, then that probably makes the most sense at this point.</p>

<p>I see… Causing a minor error in order to then trigger a more generalized error handling function to handle the specific build error circumstances.</p>

<p>DUH!! Obvious dumb mistake in hindsight.</p>
<p>I simply did not commit the source code changes to git and/or also forgot about the “/etc/whonix_buildconfig.d” dynamic configuration directory option that I did read about last week.</p>

<p>Hmmm…</p>
<p>The way I’m used to handling errors in my own applications is to have (actually existing) error handling functions print out formatted error messages.</p>
<p>What I think I was seeing in “log-bare-metal” was that the “error” function did not exist, yet was being called.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">./build-steps.d/1200_create-debian-packages: line 142: error: command not found</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">./build-steps.d/1700_install-meta-packages: line 146: error: command not found</code></pre>
<p>Seems unconventional to notify of an error by purposely causing yet another error.</p>
<p>But maybe there is good reason for this, such as maybe you’d have to repeat the same full logic code of an extra error handling function in each separate script file, so this way saves on managing LOC/complexity/changes/etc?</p>

## NTP does not work over Tor because it uses UDP.
## If it were to work, it would not be secure, because

<p>When download_package (apt-get download) fails, the prerm and postrm scripts will still be run. Since downloading the package failed, it will not be re-installed (i.e. preinst and postinst scripts will not be re-run) at first boot by whonix-initializer, which may lead to all sorts of strange bugs.</p>
<p>I think it would be better to disable it using a build configuration.</p>
<ul>

<li>export whonix_build_script_skip_verifiable=“1”</li>

</ul>
<p>(In Whonix 9 there will be a --skip-verifiable build script option.)</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<blockquote>Also, as a general development sidenote: It would be nice at some future point if build logs had clean and clear visual separation between each meaningfully separate build step. Maybe some ample spacing and framing/blocking text patterns that could be visually recognized and searched for to divide up separate macro steps and categories of macro steps, so it is easier to follow and analyze the total Whonix build log.</blockquote>

            <p>Installing VLC before the build process successfully resolves this fatal error.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install vlc</code></pre>
<p>Since VLC is not a critical component and Whonix 9 won’t completely fail because of it…</p>
<p>I think the easiest fix for now is to just instruct users to do the VLC update for 8.2 and maybe do the same or just bypass it in real-time with Whonix 9 instructions, if this is not critical or high priority to resolve for Whonix 9.</p>
<p>The only other errors I get are the same 2 errors I encountered with the Whonix-Gateway 8.2 bare metal build in “80_cleanup”, regarding “libc6” package versions.</p>
<p>The “libc6” packages were already at the newest versions before running the build process, so it might be looking (and not finding) download sources for earlier versions than the current ones.</p>

<p>These libc6 package errors can be bypassed with “c + enter”, if also not critical or high priority to resolve for Whonix 9.</p>
<p>So, as of now, with VLC pre-installed, I’m at least not getting any fatal errors that can’t be bypassed with “c + enter” with bare metal building both Whonix-Gateway 8.2 and Whonix-Workstation 8.2.</p>
<p>So I should be able to get Qubes + Whonix Source Code install guide done relatively soon.</p>
<p>Also, as a general development sidenote: It would be nice at some future point if build logs had clean and clear visual separation between each meaningfully separate build step. Maybe some ample spacing and framing/blocking text patterns that could be visually recognized and searched for to divide up separate macro steps and categories of macro steps, so it is easier to follow and analyze the total Whonix build log.</p>

<p>While this is for my Qubes work, I don’t think the issue is Qubes-specific because I’m getting the same fatal build errors in VirtualBox.</p>
<p>With the exception of a couple minor errors in the “80_cleanup” script, which I can bypass with “c + enter”,  the Whonix-Gateway build goes through and the system works fine.</p>
<p>The fatal errors occur when building the Whonix-Workstation, in the “1700_install-meta-packages” script.</p>
<p>The first error I encounter can be seemingly bypassed with the “c + enter” command.</p>
<p>Then, right after the first error, a second error prompts itself. I can input the “c + enter” command to ignore and continue on, but after doing so the entire build process errors out and quits back to a normal terminal prompt.</p>
<p>Here is the end of the “log-bare-metal” file where it errors out on the Whonix-Workstation build:</p>
