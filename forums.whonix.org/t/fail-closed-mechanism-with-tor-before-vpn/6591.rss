    <title>Fail closed mechanism with TOR before VPN</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/fail-closed-mechanism-with-tor-before-vpn/6591</link>
    <description>I am connecting to Tor before VPN with anonymous-vpn.biz according to this instructions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwO31AxfCJM

It is working ok but I dont think it has Fail Closed Mechanism. Is there a way I can just add Fail Closed Mechanism to it?  Following some of the instructions in https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_VPN?

Thanks.</description>

<p>It might already include a fail closed mechanism. As the VPN provider if that is the case. Check if <a href="https://anonymous-vpn.biz/cons-u/img/whonix_vpn.sh" rel="nofollow noopener">https://anonymous-vpn.biz/cons-u/img/whonix_vpn.sh</a> does everything mentioned in Whonix documentation.</p>
