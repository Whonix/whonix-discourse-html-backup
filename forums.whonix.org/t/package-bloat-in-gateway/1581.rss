    <title>Package bloat in gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/package-bloat-in-gateway/1581</link>
    <description>It seems the gateway doesn&#39;t really need iceweasel, icedove, vlc, and maybe more. Is there some reasoning behind having them? I can&#39;t think of any reason I would use these in the gateway, ever.

Trying to remove them results in attempting to remove some packages that seem like they&#39;re needed:

[code]user@host:~$ sudo apt-get remove iceweasel icedove vlc
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:

  libpcap0.8 libsmi2ldbl libwireshark-data libwireshark5 libwiretap4
  libwsutil4 tshark whonix-gw-desktop-shortcuts wireshark-common
Use &#39;apt-get autoremove&#39; to remove them.

            <p>It’s leftovers from the initial implementation. Can remove when upgraded to Whonix 12 (not yet released). Will no longer be installed on Whonix 12.</p>
