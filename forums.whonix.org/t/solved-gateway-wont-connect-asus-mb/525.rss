    <title>[Solved] Gateway Won&#39;t Connect - ASUS MB</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-gateway-wont-connect-asus-mb/525</link>
    <description>HI,

Thank you for your work and your time to read this. I&#39;ve been banging on this for a week. I&#39;m not educated on this stuff but I&#39;ve had a lot of fun learning. I&#39;ve never studied the first 2 layers until now. Its hard for me to ask this question intelligently but here goes.

Whonix Gateway times out during whonix check. No TOR. Something about a directory
I do have internet connectivity
TOR browser package works fine on the host.
I am not in a restricted country and have never had ISP restrictions for any activity.

My network connections are set for NAT on adapter1 with adapter enabled and line connected. Currently on the default standard adapter type pcfastIII, though I briefly tried the Intel desktop one. Adapter2 is internal connected to Whonix, adapter is enabled, cable is connected, default pcfastIII adapter type also.

Images are the latest and verified
Virtual box is latest 4.3.16
Operating system Win7 64bit

I don&#39;t know how yet to C&amp;P between guest and host but if I ifconfig:
eth0 inet   10.0.2.15      gw  10.0.2.255
eth1 inet 192.168.0.10  gw 192.168.0.255
locl   inet 127.0.0.1       gw 255.0.0.0

In my mind eth0 and eth1 on guest should be switched around but when I try to switch them in the vm I getDHCP errors during guest bootup

I had this working once but I did two things at once and when i try to duplicsate in several ways I cannot recreate. The two things I tried were: On the Vbox. I did a VBoxManage modifyvm &quot;Whonix-Gateway&quot; --natnet1 &quot;192.168/16&quot;. This is mentioned in vbox docs under advanced topics, fine tuning nat engine.

Another thing I did at the same time was disable network i control which is an ASUS motherboard Bios option that is supposed to do some packet shaping but has a reputation for slowing things down.

Suddenly Whonix check ran and then I did the couple recomended updates after a successful first run. They were suspiciously fast for going through TOR, full speed in fact.  Then I went to Whonix workstation and updated TOR or Tor browser and halfway through things froze and never worked again.

Ive tried some reinstalls and rebuilds today, The only thing left would be for me to try setting up my host adapter to use 10&#39;s instead of 192&#39;s. not sure how that should be set to even try it though as my studies :) of layer 1 and 2 are still a mere aquaintance.

Any help would be appreciated</description>

            <p>Thanks again for your time. You were of course right on the version number of whonix, my bad <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I got it working and its not a Whonix problem as far as I can tell. The newest VirtualBox versions have some driver incompatibilities. <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=48044&amp;sid=823a0618b001d17c8f266d3f41cb37e8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> VBOX Win7 Thread</a> Mine was not on the list but it appears many of these affect the lower layers of the network.</p>
<p>To fix mine I had to go into the adapter and disable my Agnitium Firewall Driver. I still need to research this to see what I’ve opened up but at least its working, right out of the box with default settings.</p>
<p>Of interest to people that run vpns on windows 7 there is a filter in the above link for a VPN filter by the name of Shrew Lightweight Filter, Cisco VPN, other firewalls of interest and some Virtualizers. Mine is not on the list… yet.</p>
<p>In short for similar problems, include sorting through your (local)adapter for third party additions.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

</aside>
<p>Not sure what you mean by times out. Can you post the full output of whonixcheck please?</p>
<p>What happens if you re-run whonixcheck? Does that error persist?</p>
<blockquote>Images are the latest and verified
<p>eth1 inet 192.168.0.10  gw 192.168.0.255</p>

Probably not latest version. Whonix 9 has been released. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/blog/whonix-anonymous-9-released">https://www.whonix.org/blog/whonix-anonymous-9-released</a>) Doesn’t use 192.168.0.10 anymore.
<blockquote>In my mind eth0 and eth1 on guest should be switched around but when I try to switch them in the vm I getDHCP errors during guest bootup</blockquote>
These changes are neither required nor recommended.
<blockquote>The two things I tried were: On the Vbox. I did a VBoxManage modifyvm "Whonix-Gateway" --natnet1 "192.168/16".</blockquote>
These changes are neither required nor recommended.
<blockquote>Another thing I did at the same time was disable network i control which is an ASUS motherboard Bios option that is supposed to do some packet shaping but has a reputation for slowing things down.</blockquote>
Sounds good if BIOS does not interfere with this.
<blockquote>They were suspiciously fast for going through TOR, full speed in fact.</blockquote>
Sometimes you get quite fast circuits. apt-get on Whonix-Gateway running through clearnet is very, very unlikely due to [url=https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation]stream isolation and uwt[/url].
<blockquote>The only thing left would be for me to try setting up my host adapter to use 10's instead of 192's.</blockquote>
These changes are neither required nor recommended.
