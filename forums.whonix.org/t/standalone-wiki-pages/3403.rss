    <description>Users are still mostly concerned about how to increase their tunnel lengths, combining VPNs with Tor etc. I think there is very little awareness for deanonymization that are not IP based.

Pages such as https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Surfing_Posting_Blogging probably do not get shared so much by users. It contains too much still useful but various advice. It&#39;s not enough on a specific topic, therefore got also bad SEO.

Therefore a few pages I am referring to as standalone pages have recently been created by me. For example the following two since these imo deserve generally (also outside of Whonxi) more awareness.

- https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Keystroke_Deanonymization
- https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stylometry

These are also useful as handy references when wanting to provide someone with a reference (that then lists other references).

The way I imagine to implement them is with wiki templates.

For example there is the standalone page:
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Malware

Based on the wiki template:
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Malware

Which is also part of:
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Education

Other lower priority stubs would like to see transformed from a stub into enough documentation at some point in future:

- https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SSH
- https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VNC</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Will creating the relevant stubs that redirect to this page be better<br>
for SEO?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, because then it can get its own meta description, meta title as<br>
well as meta image.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am wary of dismantling this page into many small fragments because<br>
users will miss something. They might not bother reading every linked<br>
page if they judge its name not interesting enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These standalone pages don’t need to be linked anywhere in any index.<br>
Not even in the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation">full documentation<br>
index</a>.</p>
<p>They’re useful as references, to be found from search engines, for<br>
advocacy blog posts and perhaps sometimes to be posted in the forums.<br>
Just another attempt at information management by be. Somehow getting<br>
our information format that works for these purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On this page I try to provide a concise bird’s eye view of every<br>
deanonymization vector to make people aware while no losing them over<br>
verbose details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that page is great to have.</p>
