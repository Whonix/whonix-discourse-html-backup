    <description>Our beloved systemd is finalizing their 248 release. Interesting in this version is:

&gt; - A new concept of &quot;system extension images&quot; as images that can extend the /usr/ or /opt/ hierarchies at run-time with additional files. The images can be read-only and its usr/opt hierarchies combined via OverlayFS. This led to a new **systemd-sysext** tool with systemd 248 for managing of system extension hierarchies.

I wonder if this can be extended to mimic the virus protect feature where we protect system directories from infection by marking them read-only?

&gt; - A new */etc/veritytab* configuration file for configuring dm-verity integrity protection for block devices.

I don&#39;t know how powerful this is to be used for system verification instead of our planned grub mechanism, but it could be handy.

&gt; - Systemd-cryptsetup can now unlock LUKS2 volumes using TPM2 hardware and FIDO2 security tokens.

&gt; - A new *systemd-cryptenroll* tool for adding TPM2 / FIDO2 / PKCS#11 security tokens to LUKS volumes.

Might be useful depending on how ready the virtual TPM is in Debian next&#39;s KVM release.

They are also almost done with their development on the out-of-memory daemon which should make VMs more stable when dealing with memory constraints.
