    <title>Suggestion for Whonix Workstation developers about virtual disks</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/suggestion-for-whonix-workstation-developers-about-virtual-disks/11686</link>
    <description>Hello. Whonix VirtualBox system is designed to have one single `.vdi` disk with one partition with `/` mountpoint so it must be stored whether on fast SSD or slow HDD. But what if a user have a small SSD and big HDD? A user might want to have high system speed and a lot of free space for storing data.

So, I suggest to make two `.vdi` files for Whonix Workstation. One is for system with mountpoint `/` and the other one for `/home` (and may be `/var`). So a user can place system `.vdi` disk to a fast SSD drive and userdata `.vdi` disk to a slow HDD drive. Do you support my opinion?</description>

            <p>Functionality wise that’s a good idea. Similar to what Qubes is doing in TemplateBasedVMs, a split root and private image.</p>
<p>Useful feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Making user data backups (only /home) easier.</li>
<li>Perhaps making re-installation/upgrades to newer Whonix releases either. (Replace root image and keep private image.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation wise it’s difficult:</p>
<ul>
<li>During VirtualBox ova import, there is no way to control to which disk location disk images are imported. (Unless perhaps there was a Whonix-Host operating system using VirtualBox.) Therefore saying root image to /var and private image to /home isn’t possible. Unless the user manually adjusts these settings. Nevertheless it would be a useful feature.</li>
<li>Stable mount configuration.
<ul>
<li>There is no /etc/fstab.d. - <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/12506">https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/12506</a>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Legacy support for users with “only” one virtual hdd.</li>
<li>Multiple platform support. (Whonix KVM)</li>
</ul>
<p>Help welcome. I suggest to document how to do this manually first.</p>
