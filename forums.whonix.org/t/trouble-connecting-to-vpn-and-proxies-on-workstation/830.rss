    <title>Trouble connecting to VPN and proxies on Workstation</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/trouble-connecting-to-vpn-and-proxies-on-workstation/830</link>
    <description>Hi all, 

In order to  get around the annoying Tor bans, I&#39;ve been trying to connect to a VPN or proxy in the workstation.

When I connect to a proxy in Chromium or Iceweasel, it usually doesn&#39;t work at all even though it&#39;s good on other systems, or when it does connect it usually drops after a few seconds or 15 minutes tops. Are there any solutions or is this just Tor&#39;s fault?

I have an OpenVPN connection setup in the KDE Network Manager, but I can&#39;t seem to get it to respond at all and even attempt a connection. I&#39;ve done this a thousand times before on Gnome Network Manager but this is really confusing me, is there something that I&#39;m missing here with what I need to do?

Cheers</description>

<p>I’d advice using OpenVPN command line. I found GUI tools harder for diagnosing issues.</p>
