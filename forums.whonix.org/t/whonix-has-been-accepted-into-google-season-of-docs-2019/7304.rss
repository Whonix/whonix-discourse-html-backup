    <description>We have more great news to share with our community. The Whonix project has been [selected to participate](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/) in Google Season of Docs ([GSoD](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)) 2019! As a recap, GSoD is Google’s annual program that fosters collaboration between open-source project and tech writers. The goal of this program is to provide a framework for technical writers and open source projects to work together towards the common goal of improving an open source project’s documentation.During the program, technical writers spend a few months working closely with an open source community. They bring their technical writing expertise to the project’s documentation, and at the same time learn about the open source project and new technologies.

Interested technical writers can find exciting project ideas on our dedicated [Season of Docs](https://whonix.org/wiki/Design/Google_Season_of_Docs_2019) wiki page. The [technical writer&#39;s guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide) contains all the information you need to get started on your way to become a technical writer for the Whonix project.


If you have any questions please don&#39;t hesitate to ask. And remember, we are looking for both skilled _and_ enthusiastic technical writers.  Anything you can do to set yourself apart from the other applicants would be in your favor. Most of all, be proactive in your approach, we want to see that you&#39;re excited to collaborate with Whonix.</description>
