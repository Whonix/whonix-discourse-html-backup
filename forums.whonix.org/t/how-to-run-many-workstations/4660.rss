    <title>How to run many workstations?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-run-many-workstations/4660</link>
    <description>I would like to run one Whonix Gateway and two or more Whonix Workstations / Other Operating Systems. But after studying network settings on Whonix Workstation and reading this https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems, I&#39;ve noticed that Whonix Workstation uses the hardcoded IP address 10.152.152.11, while for other operating system the hardcoded IP address 10.152.152.50 is recommended by the wiki.

So my question is:

- if I want to run a second/third/etc Whonix Workstation, what network setting does it need?
- same question for second/third/etc Other Operating System

Basically, I need to run a few of Whonix Workstations / Other Operating Systems through one single instance of Whonix Gateway **at the same time**. Does the wiki have a guide for doing this?</description>

<p>Those IP addresses are completely arbitrary. IIUC since the network has a netmask of 255.255.192.0 over 10.152.152.0, that means you can use any IP address in the 10.152.128.0 / 18 range (meaning 10.152.128.1 to 10.152.191.254) except for the gateway’s address (10.152.152.10). I’ve only ever tested IPs in 10.152.152.0 / 24. There may be blockers elsewhere, like in the firewall (unlikely).</p>

            <p>Hi <code>Segalla</code></p>
<p>To my knowledge there is no <em>Multiple Whonix-Workstation Other OS</em> wiki page. However, there is a wiki page on <em>Multiple Whonix-Workstations</em>. You will have to adjust the network settings for the OS you are using.</p>
