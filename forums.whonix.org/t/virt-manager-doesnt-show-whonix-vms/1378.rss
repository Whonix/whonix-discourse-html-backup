    <title>Virt-manager doesn&#39;t show Whonix vms</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/virt-manager-doesnt-show-whonix-vms/1378</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure where I went wrong.  I followed the instructions on the kvm page for installing and running Whonix via kvm/libvirt.  I get them running just fine but only as root.  If I start up virt-manager as user, it is empty and I cannot add/see any vms but if I start it as root/superuser then whonix gateway and workstation show up and work fine.  

I added a kvm and libvirt group and added myself to them but still no show as user.  How do I fix this?</description>

            <p>Hi praedor,</p>
<p>Let me know which OS you are running as your Host.</p>
<p>Be aware that certain operating systems, such as Gentoo Hardened, only permit viewing, modifying, or running virt-maanger/KVM Guests as root.  There is nothing inherently wrong, or dangerous about this.  After all, the default KVM image directory is at:  /var/lib/libvirt/images, which, of course, is a root owned directory.</p>
<p>Other OSes, like Fed 22, are more relaxed, and allow virt-manager to be run by normal users.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>CCP</p>

            <p>Try doing it with addgroup instead of usermod or the opposite and report back.</p>
