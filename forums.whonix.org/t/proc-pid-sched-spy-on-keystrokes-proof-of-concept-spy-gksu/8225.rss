    <description>I found this which may be another way to log keystrokes. It looks at /proc/pid/sched and is supposed to be able to spy on keystrokes.

It only says gksu but should work for any program. I haven&#39;t tested this yet.

We very partially mitigate this due to mounting /proc with `hidepid=2` but this will only prevent the script from spying on other users&#39; programs.

A way to mostly mitigate this would be to run every program in its own PID namespace or as its own user so it can only see its own processes.</description>
