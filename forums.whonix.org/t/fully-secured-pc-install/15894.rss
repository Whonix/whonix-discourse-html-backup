    <description>So I have been thinking, it would be really nice for less advanced users to have a 1 click install of kicksecure + whonix. When I initially found privacy tools, it was a difficult labyrinth of possibilities to navigate

I think it would be very valuable to have a one click ISO that a user could run to install kicksecure OS (with internet browser disabled) that spun up whonix. 

Is there a reason this doesnt exist? Is there a reason this is a bad idea? This could be something I worked on after WATS is done, if folks decide it is valuable :thinking:</description>

            <p>Not really Kicksecure + Whonix. Even better. Whonix-Host. An all-Tor host operating system optimized for anonymity.</p>
<p>The build script already has parameter <code>--target iso</code>. Whonix-Host is planned.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix-Host" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whonix-Host Operating System Live ISO, Whonix-Host Installer</a></h3>

  <p>Upcoming Host Operating System (In Development)</p>


  </article>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>Downside: Development has been slow. Getting distracted with other tasks. Not easy to make meaningful progress. And some difficult to resolve tasks. (BIOS boot + EFI boot + SecureBoot comparability)</p>
<p>Upside: Development has progressed far. Once there was a Whonix ISO Live that came with a graphical calamares installer. Either in ISO Live mode or after installation one could use both Whonix-Gateway and Whonix-Workstation.</p>
<p>As the next step, I would suggest to do something simpler. “Just only” a Kicksecure ISO (Live + Installert). Try to build it. See where it breaks. Collect the pieces and repair.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, Whonix-Host ISO development could continue.</p>
<p>Help very much welcome!</p>
