    <title>Whonix Gateway in VM, workstation on a different computer in lan</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-gateway-in-vm-workstation-on-a-different-computer-in-lan/78</link>
    <description>Hello, my first post here so let me start of by thanking for a wonderful software. I&#39;m probably doing something stupid so figured I would ask here.

I&#39;m currently running Whonix gateway in a VM on my HTPC (win 7) because its always on and I have hardware for it. 
&#39;
I have a different laptop that&#39;s in the network which runs Ubuntu and I&#39;ve been trying to follow https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Ubuntu#More_secure to get it to work, but I can&#39;t seem to get a connection to the internet (run firefox). 

Ubuntu is ran barebone on the laptop that I&#39;m trying to connect to the gateway and its connected through wire. I&#39;ve checked so that I don&#39;t have any DHPC Ip reserve in the router. I can ping my HTPC from ubuntu without any problem, I can&#39;t ping the whonix gateway (but that might be expected ?)

Any ideas or suggestions on what to try next? Idea was to use Ubuntu+Whonix for every day stuff and add tails in ubuntu for an extra layer of security.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards

            <p>Thanks for your response brother, I’ll investigate if I can find some cheap hardware to run the gateway on.</p>

<p>Well, when you use two network cards as one, then from a schematic point of view, you only have one network card. And Whonix-Gateway needs by design two network cards. Get a third network card perhaps?</p>
<p>Anyway. This <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_in_a_VM_.28UNTESTED_.2F_NOT_RECOMMENDED.29">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_in_a_VM_.28UNTESTED_.2F_NOT_RECOMMENDED.29</a> is really untested. We documented this for the sake of it in TorBOX times. Got one or another success report, though. However, using Whonix-Gateway physical isolation on hardware is both safer and simpler.</p>

            <p>Tinkering a bit I think I might have gone the wrong way, I should probably have followed: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_in_a_VM_.28UNTESTED_.2F_NOT_RECOMMENDED.29" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix-Gateway_in_a_VM_.28UNTESTED_.2F_NOT_RECOMMENDED.29</a></p>
<p>My current problem is that I do not entirely understand this: Adapter 2 must either be set to NAT as well (but you will need to forward ports from the host to the guest) or much simpler: use bridged networking <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">and set it to the second physical interface (the one that goes into the isolated network/point to point ethernet)</span></span></p>
<p>I have two network interfaces on my host but I’m using them in team so that I can get high speeds on my downloads without my network card dying. This then effectively becomes one card, does that mean that I have no way of setting up Whonix with physical isolation + vm?</p>
