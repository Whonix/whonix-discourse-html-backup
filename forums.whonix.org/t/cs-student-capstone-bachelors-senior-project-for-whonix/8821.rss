    <title>CS Student Capstone (Bachelor&#39;s Senior project) for Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/cs-student-capstone-bachelors-senior-project-for-whonix/8821</link>
    <description>Hey all, we&#39;re a team of CS students, considering Whonix for our senior capstone.

It&#39;s required for us to reach out to the development team... and also I suppose I&#39;m looking for maybe something a little more specific than the &quot;Just get Started&quot; directions. 

We can help out on code or documentation. Experience in Python, C, Bash Scripting, and of course, competency in git.

Any recommendations for some of the easier (but possibly tedious) problems that need solving? We could help out on bug fixing, testing, or even adding a new feature. We&#39;ve got a whole semester for this and our professor is expecting quite a bit of work. 

Advice would be much appreciated, thank you!</description>

<p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/bee">@bee</a> Right, and since we can freely work together in any capacity, we’re good to go. So, I’m okay with whatever, I’m sure my group members won’t mind too much either. The stuff Patrick suggested works, maybe make our own group on Telegram so we can have a good chat history?</p>

<p>I wouldn’t worry too much about this. Any coordination might take away time / add complication.<br>
Perhaps writing new tests later on, deciding on which test suite to use, might depend on personal taste and/or goals. Also I wouldn’t want to block the student project due new developments that happen after the initial student project discussion. That’s also because student time schedule of only around 1 month seems rather tight.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that most contributors are interested in shiny new features and before this day nobody ever started actually working on tests. Writing tests / test suites is unfortunately not a very hot topic for contributions. Therefore I am not too worried about too many people having a hard time deciding which test suite to contribute to and really happy to see progress in this important area being made! <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I would love a group chat.  For a team I contract with I use slack, so I could do a channel there.  It’s proprietary software which I am not the biggest fan of, but on the other hand I am required to use it by both of my employers, so it’s convenient.   I also use signal in my personal coms, mostly cell.</p>

<p>I’d argue that using a language for the sake of using a language isnt the best use of mental overhead, unless there is a very specific need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see what you’re saying, I think it’s just we can’t learn a new language and meet our deadlines at this point. Not ideal, but it is the way it is now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless I am misinterpreting and you are talking about bringing both our work together in the end, which I dont think will be too difficult with CI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m definitely interesting in bringing it together in the end. I think we just need to communicate to that regard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for inside/outside, I assume you are talking about nested virtualization (a debian vm running specs against a libvirt whonix vm?), which I plan to do eventually. First goal is get a single VM spun up with CI, then it should be easier to implement whatever nesting is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m specifically referring to what Patrick and I were discussing earlier, so not nested in this case. The idea is that some types of tests would have to be run on the host against the guest(s), and other tests would need to be run in the guest on it’s own components. We decided above to develop the “guest testing itself” software, with recognition that there would need to be another piece of software which ran on the host.</p>
<p>Even if our software systems end up having no feature overlap, from a user-standpoint it’d be a little silly if they ended up being totally different in the way one worked with them. As in, we should implement Gherkin in the same manner so that people don’t have to read two different sets of documentation to learn how to write a test case ( and so that we can share documentation rather than writing two completely different sets of wiki pages ).</p>
<p>On a related note, would you like to get in some kind of chat with the group of us? It might be desirable than just communicating it all out here.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am guessing you mean Ruby and Python?  Why?  Is there something you can achieve with one that you feel you cant with the other?  I’d argue that using a language for the sake of using a language isnt the best use of mental overhead, unless there is a very specific need.  Unless I am misinterpreting and you are talking about bringing both our work together in the end, which I dont think will be too difficult with CI.</p>
<p>Concerning my libvirt problems, my challenge was making it play nice with Vagrant.  I got unstuck last night after fighting some dependencies and a firmware bug.  Currently working on a vagrant file to smooth out the build process.</p>
<p>As for inside/outside, I assume you are talking about nested virtualization (a debian vm running specs against a libvirt whonix vm?), which I plan to do eventually.  First goal is get a single VM spun up with CI, then it should be easier to implement whatever nesting is necessary.</p>
<p>No idea yet how that will all look.  For me, when it comes to software, it’s easy to get lost in the <strong>how</strong> and lose sight of the <strong>what</strong>.  Maybe once I have travis, vagrant, and debian vm all working together I will have a better idea of what to do, or maybe not LOL <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/lab_coat.png?v=9" title=":lab_coat:" class="emoji" alt=":lab_coat:"></p>

            <p>Sounds good, my professor also just gave the go ahead for us to work together in general so hey. He just said to document what we do, which should be pretty straightforward, and mostly automatic since we’re doing all our work (including demo wiki pages) on the repo.</p>
<p>Thanks for the good wishes too, I will admit this is a big first for us. I have some project planning experience but this is a particular kind of challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I am always wary of new problem/new technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a good way to look at it, and thanks for the good wishes. I’d love to find a way to integrate both languages.</p>
<p>I heard ya’ll were interested in getting involved with more students too. Most colleges seem to be teaching python as the language they’re most familiar with by graduation. I think it’s the new standard now as the entry-level language that everyone has to get good at (replacing java, seemingly).</p>
<p>It’s something to consider when making and picking projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I spun up a cucumber repo and have CI working, but now I am trying to use vagrant &amp;&amp; libvirt to build the whonix VM for testing. It is a bit challenging. I plan to take another stab tonight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I have a bit of experience using Libvirt (with QEMU+KVM) on my Arch machine. So if you want any general pointers I might be able to save you a little time. The cool bit I was looking at with Libvirt is how it can simplify making things cross-compatible with different virtualization software . The GUI tool is pretty nice too if you just want something that works, I heard that ya’ll were interested in working with more students, so ease-of-use is always nice.</p>
<p>I will say libvirt broke a lot on my Arch system, but I think that was just an Arch problem.</p>
<p>One bit I just realized: Patrick and I were discussing the inside-vm and outside-vm components, with potential communication between the two. I’m hesitant to expand the scope currently, but it seems like you’re already developing some of what could be an outside-vm component?  I suppose that is the start of a larger conversation as to the path forward.</p>

<p>I don’t see any issues. <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/bee">@Bee</a> is working has a separate test suite in developing in a dedicated forum thread <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/automated-test-suite/5942/7" class="inline-onebox">automated test suite</a>. The approach is a different one. CI, building Whonix images in CI, then booting these and do kernel testing. While the test suite students are working on is focused on GUI applications. There’s no overlap.</p>

<p>Well FWIW the task is pretty large, and I don’t think my “expertise” would hinder your learning.  I am a backend dev really dabbling on the systems side of things learning also.</p>
<p>I spun up a cucumber repo and have CI working, but now I am trying to use vagrant &amp;&amp; libvirt to build the whonix VM for testing. It is a bit challenging. I plan to take another stab tonight.</p>
<p>Once I get a working, testable whonix environment, I am going to focus on kernel testing.   Point being, I think it’s pretty easy to work together without stepping on toes.  But you are welcome to keep the repo seperate and work on your end.  I simply wanted to offer the collaboration aspect since I am already working on it.</p>
<p>IDK how much looking you all have done on the tails source code, but between vagrant, sikuli, libvirt, CI/CD, cucumber, test cases, dogtail, etc…there is no shortage of things to be learned or work to be done.  Collaboration and empathy are going to be more important in your tech career than a few python specs IMO.  I am happy for as much or as little pleases your professor  <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Learning is never time wasted.  It is really awesome you are taking this on. For me I think behave seems like it could be a good way to write a suite.  I have never used it before.</p>
<p>The feature test BDD layout is great, and IMO the tooling is secondary.  I will say that I think it is important to work with the language you are most comfortable in when solving a new problem.  I am a big fan of new problem, old technology.  Or old problem (like a restful api), new technology.  But I am always wary of new problem/new techology.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>, to update you - we got a rough proof-of-concept going. It’s nothing special but it’s opening us up to the possibilities of what this can be. It seems to be satisfying all the needs you conveyed, and helped us understand the limitations of this software.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m not sure how much updating you’d like from us, but - basic timeline stuff:</p>
<p>We have to have this done in about a month and a half (Poster of the completed project on April 14th). Also, it’s required for all of us to graduate, so, I think that’s why the professor is really specific about things.</p>
<p>As for the software:</p>
<p>Behave is super cool, fully in python - and so writing new tests will require nothing but some basic python code and the super easy Gherkin.</p>
<p>The vision, I’m seeing, is to make adding on to this as easy as possible. Realistically that means we need a sane architecture that is easy to use and expand upon, and robust documentation.</p>
<p>A good example of what I mean:</p>
<p>For Behave, feature files are the natural-language component, and all have to have their own corresponding step definition file ( in Python ).</p>
<p>However, feature files can use step definitions that were defined in other feature files, and no ambiguity is allowed.</p>
<p>So, I wrote a step that could be reused, and the step before it shows an example of how other developer’s feature files could interact with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEBUG_MODE = True</p>
<p>TEST_TEXT = “Hello world!”</p>
<p><span class="mention">@given</span>(‘we are testing nano and xterm’)<br>
def step_impl(context):<br>
# applications placed here can be increased, just don’t spell it wrong<br>
context.testApplications = [“nano”,“xterm”]</p>
<p><span class="mention">@given</span>(‘the application(s) to be tested are installed’)<br>
def step_impl(context):<br>
# execute dpkg on each application to check if it’s installed</p>
<pre><code>for application in context.testApplications :
    # execute, capture output and error
    output = subprocess.check_output(["dpkg", "--status", application], encoding='ascii')
    match=re.search(r'Status: install ok installed', output)

    #no output found, throw an error
    if match is None:
        print(output)
        raise RuntimeError('Success message not found in dpkg status output!')
    else:
        print("for program: %s dpkg found status %s" % (application, match.string)) if (DEBUG_MODE) else print("")            
pass
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So the idea is, as long as someone specifies which applications they are testing in their own feature file, ex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="mention">@given</span>('we are testing ‘an_application’)<br>
def step_impl(context):<br>
context.testApplications = [“an_application”]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They could write a Gherkin script with the lines</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given we are testing ‘an_application’<br>
And the application(s) to be tested are installed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they could reuse the step defined in a separate feature file, which does that testing.</p>
<p>So that’s opening up a larger discussion for us, and we’re studying other implementations. If you or <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/bee">@Bee</a> (or whoever else) wants to weigh in on how this should be done, I’m sure it would be very helpful. But, we’re just a bunch of students so I don’t want to waste ya’lls time. Thanks for the help and sorry again for taking so long to get back. Apparently spam filters will eventually target Whonix.</p>

<p>About that documentation on the git repo - it’s just a rough placeholder I threw in. Our documentation guy is supposed to be hitting on that soon. We have a private repo we have to maintain for our college which has a more correct install. Thanks for the infographics though, definitely, I’m going to link them to our documentation guy.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/fahr3n">@fahr3n</a>,</p>
<p>After discussing with <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>, I would love to help you out with the project.  I am a software engineer who works mainly with Rails during the day. I have extensive history in automated test suites, SDLC, agile workflows, CI/CD, etc.</p>
<p>I am happy to build a project board, PR templates, code reviews,  etc.  I think this would be a good thing for your learning as well, as it is very useful for working on professional teams.</p>
<p>You can find me on github <span class="mention">@mycobee</span>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Alright, it’s official. We’re clear to start working on the project. I’m not sure if you want to list our team (3 of us) as maintainers, but the odds of us not pushing this project to completion is quite slim. At this point we’d have to redo quite a bit of work if we wanted to do something else. So yeah, we’re moving.</p>
<p>Our current timeline is to push out a hello world super soon, which is where we will need to make sure that we have a way of storing our code that can eventually be merged in when completed. I’m assuming a github repo, correct? That seems to be what our professor desires. This is also our software setup as far as the different working pieces. We could touch base to just make sure it’s all packaged properly, and save us time later.</p>
<p>Then we’ll build a prototype, that contains basic functionality. That should be done by the end of the month, with time to spare for us to get back to you and ensure it’s what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>From there, our plan is to expand outwards, installing additional features (as far as command-line options, quality of life improvements, better support, etc), and eventually, hopefully, moving on to create the outside-vm module afterwards.  It’d be nice to have the inside-vm component done by the end of the month in it’s entirety, and after that moving onwards to bigger and better features. One executable that allows the creation of multiple VM’s, and tests that run on those VM’s, would be wonderful. This would involve the outside-inside VM communication as previously discussed, probably over the virtual network using TCP/IP. This would come after the completion of the inside-vm component as a standalone.</p>
<p>From our design meeting: libvirt, and other features that start and stop VM’s would need to run on the host, so those features would actually be part of the outside-vm component, to be built later.</p>
<p>As for the inside-vm component, which is our first priority, software decisions currently are:</p>
<p>behave will be our cucumber-like component. It is python-based and semi-official. It will allow us to keep things in python, with a bash script to get it all going. We’ll eventually create some of your previously suggested test-cases when it comes time to create the prototype.</p>
<p>Dogtail is a possibility for our GUI tool, we’re unsure as to whether or not it’s sufficient, but it has python 3 support so. We’re looking into running that as our working GUI automation tool. Realistically, Dogtail seems to have slow development but it looks mature.</p>
<p>As for any legal stuff, just credit for our work is sufficient. We’ll probably link to the code repo from our github accounts. A resume addition, essentially. Do what you will with it, sell it, whatever.</p>
<p>We’ve also recognized that part of this project involves creating effective documentation as to how to create test-cases and make use of the tool. This should be something that anyone could read, and make sense of. This work is factored in to our plans. It should be easy for other contributors to add test-cases, and we see creating a proper set of test-cases as somewhat outside the scope of our project. We’re just looking to create the test-cases set you suggested, and generally ensure the software is working properly and has all required features. The suite of test cases, and the possible features for the test-case definitions will need to be expanded over time.</p>
<p>As long as it’s sufficient for us to use our own repo, to hopefully be merged when the work is completed, we’ll use the repo previously linked on this post - the one for the project proposal. Our documentation to accompany the software can go on the wiki for that repo.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help, contributions incoming.</p>

<p>You mention using “wats” more generically. Have you considered the implications of naming it something like - “whonix-ats”?</p>
<p>In my experience, when distros have tools that are useful, that they make available to other distros, it can drive more traffic to the distro. My immediate thought is with the arch wiki. I basically installed arch at one point just because of that wiki. Same goes for my knowledge of Redhat &amp; Fedora. It was because I needed something (for my arch system) that they had built, which happened to be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>Just an idea, from my marketing knowledge. Brand-awareness right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I didn’t see it that way. Interesting! I always thought people are quick to dismiss. When they see “whonix-something” they immediately dismiss as “for Whonix - not for me (Debian)”. I will leave the naming to you. Rather minor point for me.</p>

<p>Ordering of tests: perhaps quick and less likely to fail tests go first? Tests could be numbered.</p>

<p>Numbers shouldn’t be direct decrescendos. I.e. not 1, 2, 3. Better 100_somehing. 200_something. If we later add something there will be enough “space” to insert numbers without having to rename existing files.</p>

<p>Both CLI and GUI tests. Did you find a list of tests that Tails is running?</p>
<p>Some ideas (higher -&gt; higher priority. Very unfixed priorities.):</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Tor Browser, visit some websites, visit onion websites, close Tor Browser. Did it properly terminate with exit code 0 or some other? Did the process terminate or is it lingering?</li>
<li>change password</li>
<li>run upgrades</li>
<li>reboot</li>
<li>run <code>whonixcheck --verbose --leak-tests --gui --cli</code>, check if there is a whonixcheck CLI output, if there is a GUI window popup, if that is dismissable using OK or close button</li>
<li>other activities users are doing such as start dolphin, browse some files, open a file in a text editor, type something, save file.</li>
<li>edit file with root rights</li>
<li>other common activities which come to your mind?</li>
<li>screen resolution (vs virtualbox guest addition bugs)</li>
<li>copy/paste text from host to vm and back</li>
<li>shared folder tests</li>
<li>boot into recovery mode</li>
<li>normal boot and switch to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Virtual_Consoles">virtual console</a>
<ul>
<li>switch back to graphical console</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>set up serial console <code>sudo apt install serial-console-enable</code>
</li>
<li><code>sudo apt install debug-misc</code></li>
<li>lower VM RAM to 256 MB
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/RAM_Adjusted_Desktop_Starter</a></li>
<li>login in console</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>enough for now or should I come up with more?</li>
</ul>
<p>The tests ideally would be aware in which boot mode (normal, recovery, future <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/multiple-boot-modes-for-better-security-persistent-user-live-user-persistent-admin-persistent-superadmin-persistent-recovery-mode/7708">others</a>) it would boot and which virtual terminal it would run the test in. Maybe that could be an abstraction.</p>
<p>Some tests are virtualizer specific. A lot tests will function in Qubes-Whonix hopefully (such as Tor Browser tests) but shared folder tests are different for VBox / KVM.</p>

            <p>Excellent, we seem to be on the same page for a lot of things.</p>
<p>You mention using “wats” more generically. Have you considered the implications of naming it something like - “whonix-ats”?</p>
<p>In my experience, when distros have tools that are useful, that they make available to other distros, it can drive more traffic to the distro. My immediate thought is with the arch wiki. I basically installed arch at one point just because of that wiki. Same goes for my knowledge of Redhat &amp; Fedora. It was because I needed something (for my arch system) that they had built, which happened to be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>Just an idea, from my marketing knowledge. Brand-awareness right?</p>
<p>__</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That sounds awesome and fits well into my “more generic” idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More generic I think is something that should result from good design. What we name it I think is separate from what it is capable of.</p>
<p>It would be super cool if we labeled our tests as to which components they work on.</p>
<p>“Debian Test - 012 - (human-readable-label) - Failed! - x xxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxx xxxx”</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>“Whonix Test  - 010 (human-readable-label) - Failed! - x xxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxx xx”</p>
<p>We’d curve bug reports to the right people that way. I’m sure some tests wouldn’t quite be able to narrow it down, but it would be nice if we tested from the bottom up, I think.</p>
<p>That opens up the larger discussion as to how the tests should be ordered, and how the instructions for creating the tests should be.</p>
<p>I’m not so knowledgeable on that so I’m all ears for your advice.</p>
<p>Also, do you have any more specifics as to what this suite should/could be capable of? What kind of error information it should return?</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>As for the contract, I’ll make sure to confirm with my team. I don’t want to waste too much time on that, so I’ll get back to you.</p>
<p>For license, GPLv3+? It is saying here that v3 is the latest? <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html</a></p>

<p>Personally, I have experience with AWS. It would be pretty neat if I could set up a docker container system, which just lets it all freely run through the cloud. Not sure if there are security concerns with that, I know people can get paranoid.</p>
<p>The key idea really, separating it from docker, would be that IF we went the CI server route, developing an image that could be hosted anywhere, easily, would be ideal.</p>
<p>I see the CI as more of “icing on the cake.” As in, it would come after, if time allows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There could be a command line switch for normal running tests and short running tests + long running tests. (There are some strange bugs where connectivity for an existing connection breaks after 30 minutes or something but new connection are still possible.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>solid command line options will be desirable. That might be a point of continued communication.</p>

<p>Good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inside vs Outside VM idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m familiar with whonixcheck. I wonder if the inside-vm and outside-vm could communicate?</p>
<p>For compatibility with virtualbox:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I believe libvirt offers an API that should significantly assist that process. Libvirt has some problems but it should be super useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think one of my team members will be working with virtualbox. So, support will happen for it regardless.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Functionally speaking, I think we just need a priority for our tasks to get going. It sounds like the inside-vm would be the priority. Should CI support or outside-VM be priority next?</p>
<p>Once we get into writing up specific implementations I think we’ll have a better idea of what will cost what.<br>
This test suite vs test-suite inside sounds like two different pieces of software.</p>
<p>One would interact heavily with libvirt, the other would interact with the GUI automator, like sikuli.</p>
<p>I wonder, could they communicate? I’m envisioning a server connection between host and guest, which allows commands to be sent from the outside-VM to the inside-VM software. This would allow more types of testing to be seamlessly utilized.</p>
<p>That software would be capable of performing the full installation process automatically, using the libvirt API. It could even test virtualbox + QEMU support. Interesting ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little ego, high flexibility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely, we’ll keep this agile.</p>
<p>Cool stuff, it seems like we’re getting somewhere.</p>

<p>Right. Tails can be an inspiration but there isn’t much dependency on Tails. I mean, if any of Tails code can be re-used, the better. Re-using is better then re-invention. But if it seems impractical, if it seems making things more difficult, we need to re-use nothing from Tails.</p>
<p>There is also no requirement “must re-use from Tails”. Tails is an example. That’s about it. No hard dependency. The main goal is to invent something useful for Whonix (and perhaps useful for others too since Open Source). Tails is useful for inspiration on what kind of things are useful to test. I can certainly think off other tests which may be useful too. Such as as “more long term connectivity test”.</p>

</aside>
<p>Stuff available from <a href="http://packages.debian.org">packages.debian.org</a> is ideal. I.e. everything that can be installed on Debian using <code>sudo apt install pkg-name</code> is perfect.</p>
<p>Looks doable. Tails setup guide <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/setup/">https://tails.boum.org/contribute/release_process/test/setup/</a> doesn’t pull any/much external (not from <a href="http://packages.debian.org">packages.debian.org</a>) dependencies.</p>
<p>I think this could be separated into an “inside-vm” and “outside-vm” part.</p>
<p>The “inside-vm” part isn’t actually really necessarily “inside a VM”. It could be running on a Debian host, a <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a> host, a future Whonix-Host, inside a Whonix-Gateway VM or inside a Whonix-Workstation VM. This would be similar to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonixcheck">whonixcheck</a>.</p>
<p>I.e. “sudo apt install wats” could install a program which once started, tests various things. This is the most important part.</p>
<p>The “outside-VM” part could be separate. The task of this would be to automatically start a VM, runs commands/tests inside the VM, reboot the VM, shut down the VM. This is virtualizer specific. This is less important. If you could do that too, great, if not, also OK. Recently started a bit developing such a thing:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/virtualbox-test-vm">https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/virtualbox-test-vm</a></p>
<p>Could also be KVM (since there is Whonix KVM too) based. Ideally not hardcoded so any KVM function can later be re-implemented for VirtualBox too. (Keeping the “holes” open for that to happen aka “plugin”.)</p>
<p>There might be better, more clever ways to implement that which I am very much open for. This can maybe discussed later.</p>
<p>Let me know if you think such a separation between “test suite” and “run testsuite inside VM automation” makes sense. I don’t want to force any decisions which make this hard/impossible to implement. The implementation should be doable, fun and long term maintainable. That’s why this is a “little ego, high flexibility thing”.</p>
<p>Will take some points from <a href="https://github.com/johncameronquinn/wats-senior-capstone/wiki/Project-Proposal">https://github.com/johncameronquinn/wats-senior-capstone/wiki/Project-Proposal</a> and share my view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proposed software will be subsequently referred to as the WATS - Whonix Automated Testing Suite in this report.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is OK however this might be actually more generic (Debian, Kicksecure, Whonix-Host, Whonix VMs). It doesn’t have to do all at once but perhaps to implement Debian support it would be as simple as deleting the Whonix specific tests. Or perhaps having Whonix specifc tests in a drop-in <code>.d</code> folder and/or having some command line switch or parameter to specify which tests should be run. Other distributions might appreciate to re-run the “basic tests” (if there will be such a thing).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>License Proposal</p>
<p>I would like our code to be GPLv3 licensed. As opposed to say, MIT licensed, or Apache Licensed. I personally agree with the GNU foundation and support it’s mission, so their license is my preferred for that reason. Of course, we could discuss other licenses too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can be your Open Source license/copyright. This is very doable in this case. Whonix already includes code/licenses which are not under Whonix copyright / license. Nothing new. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/lkrg">https://github.com/Whonix/lkrg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad">https://github.com/Whonix/tirdad</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/kloak">https://github.com/Whonix/kloak</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these licenses that you mentioned are OK.<br>
(Others could be discussed.)<br>
If GPL: GPLv3+ preferred over GPLv3 but just a wish, not a requirement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that since we are giving up all of our rights to our code to them, aka “it becomes their code” they could decide to license it under something else. I don’t think this could actually happen, or ever would happen, but it’s a thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can keep the copyright too. All of this can be a written, signed agreement if you like. Copyright / licensing very most likely will find agreement.</p>
<p>(I doubt you are going to suggest proprietary-only licenses.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, we are not creating all the test cases. That is why software like Cucumber seems to be so important. If we create the WATS properly, others can contribute the Cucumber scripts which will perform the actual tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds awesome and fits well into my “more generic” idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the WATS is a Continuous Integration Server?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily. But possibly.</p>
<p>See my “test suite” and “run testsuite inside VM automation” idea above.</p>
<p>Are there any public server instances that Whonix could use?</p>
<ul>
<li>travis CI</li>
<li><a href="https://staging.kernelci.org/">https://staging.kernelci.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kernelci/">https://github.com/kernelci/</a></li>

<li><a href="http://travis.debian.net/">http://travis.debian.net/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There might not be.</p>
<p>If required I can also rent a server for that. Initially you might want to host it yourself and I and whoever else wants to reproduces according to your instructions the same server setup.</p>
<p>A “server” could also be a spare notebook of mine which I am using for manual testing now currently anyhow. Usually I have a number of VMs there. Whonix-Gateway-XFCE-15.0.0.6.6<br>
Whonix-Workstation-XFCE-15.0.0.6.6<br>
Whonix-Gateway-XFCE (a newer build)<br>
Whonix-Workstation-XFCE (a newer build)<br>
Whonix-Gateway-CLI (a newer build)<br>
Whonix-Workstation-CLI (a newer build)<br>
Kicksecure-XFCE (a newer build)<br>
Kicksecure-CLI (a newer build)</p>
<p>And then I am wondering: does each of them boot, is each of the functional? Still functional after reboot? Can each of them be upgraded without issues from stable repository? Still after reboot? Ok, let’s reset that, upgrade from testers or developers repository? Does still work?</p>
<p>I.e. that’s two main tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing a new build of Whonix if it is still fully functional.</li>
<li>Booting existing Whonix VMs, upgrade them and see if something breaks after upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not so much “i do a commit”, “travis CI detects the commit”, “travis CI automatically builds, installs, tests the package”, “I get an e-mail if some commit broke something”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>I will need to contact Patrick on performance considerations, because this will limit our design. However, I suspect the performance won’t have be a major concern for User Interface simulation. BUT, I could be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed performance is of almost no concern. This certainly should not be implemented in C or C++. Otherwise I am not fixated on which languages to use.</p>
<p>There could be a command line switch for normal running tests and short running tests + long running tests. (There are some strange bugs where connectivity for an existing connection breaks after 30 minutes or something but new connection are still possible.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patrick suggested we could take things from them. I don’t know if he means we can use their code but I suspect using any of their code is fair game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if useful and doable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For usability testing, we could pull a version of a Whonix package we know is broken (using past commits and the bug fix history), and write a test case that is designed to catch that bug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see no reason to build any form of a GUI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. A tool which developers and perhaps testers can run which outputs OK or which tests failed on the usual terminal output.</p>
<p>Let me know if there’s something that I forgot to address or that comes up.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help. I’ve looked into Tails implementation a great deal, because we definitely need to make sure this is the right difficulty.</p>
<p>We’ve talked it over and whatnot too, talked to my professor. In short, this seems feasible, very doable, for us to create something pretty similar to what Tails has going. The Tails system is really elegant it seems, with a focus on using other established programs, and their Automated Testing Suite linked those programs together in an intelligent fashion, really with some very thin code.</p>
<p>Cucumber is a really big deal in the Tails implementation, because it’s a very “non-technical” method for creating test cases using their formal language. It’s super cool because it prioritizes ease of use. That makes a lot of sense to us, because, whatever system we do design, it needs to be easy for other people to create test cases.</p>
<p>So, what my understanding is that we seem to be very capable of creating a Whonix variant that satisfies much of what the Tails system does, or maybe all of it? Or maybe better than what Tails does? See, so that’s where you come in. We’d like to work with you a bit to establish what exactly you want to build, and how we should package it. It’s important that it gets merged and actually used, after all.</p>
<p>Also, things like what types of software we choose are really important too. Packaging it as a .deb shouldn’t be a problem, but how would we go about getting it added? These are things our professor asked us to make sure. I’ve created a repository for our team, and posted our project proposal there, if you want to get a better detailed view as to what we have here. Happy to be working with you.</p>
