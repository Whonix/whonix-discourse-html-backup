    <title>use XFCE with Wayland</title>

    <description>Most important question:

**could we just swap out the XFCE window manager which isn’t wayland capable and replace it with a wayland capable window manager?**

[quote=&quot;Patrick, post:10, topic:8900&quot;]
wayland would be nice to have for better security (didn’t try yet)

wayland related TODO:

* lxsudo will probably no longer work and therefore break some things, because [quote Debian wayland](https://wiki.debian.org/Wayland):
  * &gt; I’m accustomed to running various programs (e.g. synaptic) as root in my X session. How will this work under Wayland?

    * &gt; (In fact, [synaptic](https://packages.debian.org/synaptic) was [removed from buster](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1037065/synaptic-removed-from-testing/) because it doesn’t work under Wayland.)

    * &gt; There are plans to allow X11 applications running as root to use XWayland but native Wayland applications need to be restructured into a GUI part and a root part.
  * For example `lxsudo /usr/bin/tor-control-panel` would break. Some of our GUI applications would have to be modified to run as user and then perhaps using a sudoers exception to run the actual part where these requires roots.

Before jumping straight into enlightenment, are there other desktop environments worth considering?

https://wiki.debian.org/DesktopEnvironment

Another option could be Openbox.

https://wiki.debian.org/Openbox

Openbox is only a window manager. We’d need to choose a task bar (and maybe a systray) application. Perhaps among other components. Kinda building a custom desktop environment. That might actually work better than XFCE (or any desktop environment) and cutting what we don’t need to actually pull any dependencies that we do need.

Mostly unrelated to Openbox, i found this I found the explanation very good.

&gt; To understand what Openbox actually is, it’s important to know the difference between a window manager and a desktop environment.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; A window manager is the program which draws on your screen the “boxes” in which other programs are run. A window manager controls how program windows work, look and act. It decides what window decorations to use and gives you a way to move the windows, hide them, resize them, minimize them and close them. It controls what buttons you push to do those things, and what keys you press to make those things happen.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, a desktop environment minds the entire desktop. It provides a taskbar, a system tray, a login manager, additional menus or perhaps screensavers and desktop icons. It might include a file manager, a text editor or some other accessory programs, too.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Openbox is a window manager, not a desktop environment. Openbox is only responsible for maintaining the windows you open on your screen – nothing else. That means installing Openbox won’t give you easy menu access to wallpaper options, a taskbar or system panel, or most of those other doo-dads. It does, however, give you a framework to incorporate other programs that do those things – and usually with a greater degree of freedom over the style and interface.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Openbox can be used alone, without a desktop environment, or it can be used to replace the window manager in a complete desktop environment. Either way is acceptable.

I.e. if it’s “just” about getting wayland support **could we just swap out the XFCE window manager which isn’t wayland capable and replace it with a wayland capable window manager?** That might be a lot more doable and sensible than reinventing the whole desktop environment implementation.

+1 It seems Wayland has it’s own Window manager implementation that can be tried out. They plan to make the underlying code a generic lib for rebranding /reuse in other projects.

https://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html#heading_toc_j_11

While window managers are a great direction, I still think we need something that allows access to system settings so brightness and resolution can be easily adjusted,

            <p>Wayland support is mature in GNOME and GNOME Shell, but in-VM 3D acceleration is a <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application-development/9781849519427/1/ch01lvl1sec10/system-requirements">hard</a> <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/53018/is-it-possible-to-run-gnome-3-without-3d-acceleration-hardware">requirement</a>. While I have confidence in the 3D implementation in KVM, I don’t for VBox and having an option that doesn’t require it is better for attack surface reduction.</p>
<p>It’s a trade-off of whether GNOME/Wayland + 3D accel attack surface  is &lt; Xfce + X11 without 3D accel. I don;t know if a Wayland supporting Xfce would inherit GNOME’s 3D reqs. An alternative that uses Wayland without needing a graphics API is the best of all worlds.</p>

Yeah, unfortunately the clipboard does not function between the active Xephyr instance and the native desktop environment. That’s the one thing that kind of spoils it as a pretty good workaround.<br>
For Xephyr, it was a matter of two commands:<br>
Xephyr  -resizeable -screen (whateverXwhatever) :714 (or whatever display you want to specify, it doesn’t matter)<br>
and second command (in separate terminal window) was:<br>
DISPLAY=:714 /path/to/app<br>
Then it worked. The clipboard is annoying, I’ll admit. I’ll research it.<br>
When you start the Tor Browser, since it uses a specific window size depending on the size of your monitor, thats why I left the -resizeable option. This way, the Xephyr window starts a little bigger, then when Tor starts in the Xephyr window, just resize the outer xephyr display window with Tor’s window if the black stripe is bothersome.<br>
To be fair, I am not sure if the benefits are necessarily worth the hassle of potentially losing clipboard and fiddling with displays, although it could probably be scripted.<br>
Xpra I have had some resolution issues and bugs like the application window not forming all the way, dpi is wrong in the launched xpra window and others. Others use xpra with no issues so it could be the specific recipe of my machine’s drivers/graphics/egl.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some browsing led me to this:<br>

            <p>If it turns out that XFCE with Wayland would not be possible, would something like Xpra or Xephyr be a candidate? I have gotten Xephyr to work in regular Debian 10 with just a couple commands. Xpra works as well, but there were some compositing and graphics issues. With Xephyr, it was possible to resize the window and embed it seamlessly. The Tor Browser worked in that new display window and there were not any cpu issues (like using a large percentage at once).<br>
At least this would stop the danger of one X app spying on other one. It might be interesting to use it in addition to some of the isolation / sandbox projects being developed right now, like the sandbox-app-launcher for example.</p>

            <p>I thought Wayland integrated the window manager, tty display server and compositing all in one main application? Like in X you can have compositing as a separate entity or not at all, but in Wayland, it’s part of the whole thing.<br>
In other words, I don’t think there is such a thing as a Wayland compositor-only package or a window-manager only, like there are for X ( examples for X like Compton, Compiz, for compositing and fluxbox, metacity, enlightenment for window managers among others).<br>
Sway is an interesting project. I wonder how it would integrate with xfce, if it can? Would it require gtk3 and would it finally put an end to X’s famous problem of every window having access to every other one? I know that some de’s support both X and Wayland out of the box, though. xfce does not, but could it be made to?</p>
