    <title>[Solved] ro-mode-init not working</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/solved-ro-mode-init-not-working/8817</link>
    <description>So I finally bothered to move from 14 to 15 and having a couple teething troubles.

I did the fresh image install rather than upgrading the 14 to 15.

First thing I notice is that both gateway and workstation take an age to shutdown now (like 2minutes). I tried changing from 512 ram to 1gig and made no difference so wondering if it might be something else?

Secondly the ro-mode-init doesn&#39;t seem to work for me. I installed the package and shutdown and set kvm to read-only and reboot and check the live mode in startup however it seems to just boot into the grub one rather than ro-mode one because the tick is in the system tray and from reading the wiki that only happens in the grub version and more importantly whenever I reboot it does not autoboot into live-mode which is the main thing I want.

So what could be going wrong here in both these cases?</description>

<p>To switch to Live mode automatically?</p>

</aside>
<p>No, but I was expecting the <em>system</em> to boot into live-mode automatically. I had no idea it was due to a conflict with boot loaders as I had no idea the ro-mode package was also a boot loader; I thought maybe it just changed some settings in the current one in order to do its thing.</p>
<p>I don’t think I can be blamed for that when I followed the wiki to the letter, or so I thought ,and it said nothing about this. Not criticising but I had know way to know.</p>
<p>The wiki just says once the ro-mode package is installed to set your hard-drive to read-only, which I did, and reboot and select Live-Mode from the menu in order for it to automatically boot into read only mode on each boot.</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-initramfs -u
</code></pre>
<p>This part is missing from <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Live/ro-mode-init" rel="nofollow noopener">the wiki</a>.</p>
<p>It makes more sense given what you say about them being both boot-loaders in conflict with one another.</p>
<p>Also part of my confusion was that I don’t remember such issues when I installed 14, I think it automatically switched switched to the ro-mode one once it was rebooted.</p>
<p>Will try with suggestions mentioned, thanks.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<pre><code>sudo update-initramfs -u
</code></pre>
<p>seems to have fixed the issue. I will make a new one about the slow shutdown problem.</p>

</p>
<p>To switch to Live mode automatically?</p>
<p>Since grub-live is installed by default now I guess this causes confusion to co-install ro-mode-init. The second grub boot menu entry should not be there.</p>

Does the indicator only work for the grub method or is it supposed to see both?

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>i have not gotten ro-mode-init to work for autobooting into live mode yet either.  an easy work around for the moment is to edit “/etc/default/grub” and change “GRUB_DEFAULT=0” to “GRUB_DEFAULT=2”.  then, run “sudo update-grub”.  on your next boot, the live mode will be selected by default going forward. it’s a simple minor failsafe for a situation where you may have inadvertently forgotten to set your whonix disk back to “readonly” in virt-manager.</p>
