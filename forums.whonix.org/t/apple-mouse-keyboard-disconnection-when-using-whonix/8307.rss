    <title>Apple Mouse&amp;Keyboard disconnection when using Whonix</title>

    <description>I started up Whonix after a while for some Tor activity, and I noticed this problem for the 100th time! So I decided to send a report of it here so hopefully we can fix it by the time I have more time when I want to focus on the last networking related problem I have (Patrick knows)


I&#39;ve had this problem since the first time I started using Whonix. Even though at first it was hosted on my Ubuntu which I am not using anymore since I installed a new Linux distro, so this answers and disapproves your possible guess that this might be a host-OS problem...

I use an Apple magic mouse and a Apple wireless keyboard (not the latest version of the keyboard, it kinda looks like the new one and isn&#39;t those old timy ones) Of course both of them are wireless. Note that my system is NOT an Apple device, I just use the mouse and keyboard for a reason which I can&#39;t say in public, not important though.
The problem is that every time I use Whonix, the mouse and keyboard start disconnecting and I reconnect them manually. and they just keep disconnecting once a few minutes (like every ~5 min)
If any more details about the problem is needed ask me and I&#39;ll send them.

Btw, I remembered this theory that I had before, when I was typing a part of this post, I&#39;m gonna post it in a new topic since it&#39;s not really related to this one. It&#39;s privacy related.

Thanks.</description>

<p>Remove one layer of complexity, and distractions: Whonix<br>
Reproduce on Debian.<br>
Report to whoever responsible (potential candidates: Linux kernel, Debian, Apple, VirtualBox (only this is happening in VM only)).</p>

<p>So if the problem presents itself again, even though it might not be software related (cue spying…) at all, maybe I should report this to Debian? I probably won’t but just wanna know what you think.</p>
