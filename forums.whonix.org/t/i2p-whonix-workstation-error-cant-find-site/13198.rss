    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/i2p-whonix-workstation-error-cant-find-site/13198</link>
    <description>Hi

Been all day trying to get i2p setup on a whonix workstation. Have reinstalled several times and tried reinstall about 5 times. If I can fix this, I&#39;ll re-write the confusing guide.

Trying to use this guide: whonix/wiki/I2P#I2P_client_inside_Whonix-Workstation

I used the repos:

deb deb.i2p2.no/ stable main
deb-src deb.i2p2.no/ stable main



I made fresh worksation, sys-whonix and gateway. 

Not sure if I needed to but I also followed: whonix/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy

And then edited sudoedit /etc/uwt.d/50_user.conf adding: uwtwrapper_global=&quot;0&quot;

And also did sudoedit /etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf adding: TB_NO_TOR_CON_CHECK=1
CURL_PROXY=&quot;--fail&quot;

Also did sudoedit /etc/privoxy/config: forward .i2p 127.0.0.1:4444

And proceeded to use all Tor Browser setttings recommended in the guy.

However one of my questions is where it says uwt, am I supposed to buy a proxy and put those settings here?

Is this what&#39;s causing &quot;cant find site&quot; errors?

Other then that I went through the wizard mentioned here:  127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/wizard

Tried both http and socks. neither works.

The router config page does pull up. Shows 100s of peers and that I&#39;m connected. I can visit regular sites. But nothing that is *.i2p.

Does HTTPS have anything to do with messing up connection to localhost? Because I tried but can&#39;t fund a way to turn it off or remove https everywhere from firefox.

Ty for the assistance!</description>

<p>No need. I2P in Whonix-Workstation worked earlier without that.</p>

<p>Wait I’m totally confused now. And missed this part of your message. Sorry my screen is very tiny. So if I understand correctly I shouldn’t be using Proxyfier turning off uwt wrapper?</p>
<p>And now I just read that Proxyfier and Privoxy are different? I think that’s where I messed up. I thought these were the same.</p>
<p>I’ll go back and do it again without the proxyfier and uwt stuff. Will report back.</p>

            <p>Probably should merge the threads. I’m too using qubes. Seems to be same problem.</p>
<p>Seems there is no way to permanently remove https-everywhere anymore in tor browser seems to be hardcoded now. But I made sure it was disabled using troubleshoot mode. Hopefully disabled but who knows.</p>
<p>However I tried your curl commands and get “could not resolve host” in terminal from various i2p links with only http. So definitely know it’s not an https redirect problem.</p>
<p>I also used all of xVx’s about:config settings, no luck.</p>
<p>Should I switch from the source distro to flatpak?</p>
<p>Other than that, I got freenet in another vm working using the vpn through tor method.</p>
<p>Should I switch to that method instead of this proxyifier method?</p>
<p>There is something I’m confused about. In this part of this guide: dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy#uwt</p>
<p>It mentions "uwt uses torsocks. While the name torsocks implies it is Tor specific, it is not. You can point it to any socks proxy. " I didn’t do anything here. I though technically setting up proxyfier and adding<br>
<code>forward .i2p 127.0.0.1:4444</code> to sudoedit /etc/privoxy/config<br>
is somehow the proxy?</p>
<p>Should I be buying an actual proxy or could I just use my vpn like I did with freenet?</p>
<p>That’s the only thing I think I missed is that I should’ve setup an actual external third-party proxy at the end. Which hopefully VPN through tor would work too.</p>
