    <description>Ref: http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/BitMessage

Please edit the Bitmessage entry with the section on Account Registration.    

That  registration refers to a totally separate (a &quot;gateway&quot; operated by a different entity not associated with Bitmessage.  The use of the domain name bitmessage.ch is or can be misleading as well.)  Being a a totally different service from the Bitmessage P2P service itself, its operator attempts to provide a convenient service for users coming in via the public internet. 

Also kindly note that this &quot;gateway&quot; service is no longer accepting registrations. There is also a &quot;web clone&quot; at http://a-smail.net/ which uses a different set of certificate credentials while somewhat purporting yet pointing to the one at bitmessage.ch  

With the evident wisdom and cautionary best practices exemplified by the gurus at Whonix, I did not want to remain silent least any uninformed person unwittingly assumes that the insecure gateway service is part and parcel of the P2P Bitmessage service which it is not.

TIA

<p>Yes, that could be confusing. Proposed a change to clarify that. Thanks for pointing that out. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
