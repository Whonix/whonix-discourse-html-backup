    <title>Arm new identity relation with Bridges inside ACW/Whonix</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/arm-new-identity-relation-with-bridges-inside-acw-whonix/5904</link>
    <description>What is the relation between Arm new identity button (press n) with the existing already saved bridges? 

as i am reading it , its kinda has no effect, as arm will not produce new bridges in order to change the user identity. so its either useless relation or shadow relation which we dont know what is going on.</description>

            <p>new identity button and bridges are unrelated.</p>
<p>Bridges are the first hop. Similar to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards#Introduction">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards#Introduction</a>. Theyâ€™re not supposed to change during newnym.</p>
<p>New identity is only for the middle or exit relay.</p>
