            <p>Whonix with kde runs pretty, anyway I was test it with xfce4 on both of guests, it is notable better on performance , should someone become maintainer , xfce4 is rich on tweaks and apps, and have allmost the 1/3 of kde minimum hardware requirements , i have not time for maintain and perhaps the ability, but i know it is obviusly better for whonix to have xfceâ€™s because of 2 guests run at the same time . I believe xfce is secure as gnome , anyway considered untested and for that unsecure, The other way for see diference on  performance is to replace hdd by an sata ssd with at least 120 GB capacity , must install the host there and whonix inside that , this will increase whonix performance for 40% standard *all ready tested.</p>
