    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/beyond-grsecurity-the-future-of-linux-security-is-brighter-than-ever/3842</link>
    <description>&lt;small&gt;Originally published at:			https://www.whonix.org/blog/beyond-grsecurity-future-linux-security-brighter-ever
		&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those of us following security news have heard about grsec&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://grsecurity.net/passing_the_baton_faq.php&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; by now. 

If you are a current grsec sponsor reading this who doesn&#39;t like their de-facto violation of kernel code licensing, I urge you to privately leak updated versions to Kees Cook (keescook@chromium.org) who can study and incorporate the code into mainline without endangering your access. This will free changes back to the community where they belong and in the long-term you won&#39;t be forced to pay through the nose to run a secure kernel. 

PaXTeam is making a &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/721274/&quot;&gt;false equivalency&lt;/a&gt; between their hostile actions and RedHat licensing. To be clear, the GPL does not restrict monetizing software. However businesses can still make handsome profits working around the license by providing support services. RedHat releases back source code - though not in the neat broken up patch-sets but they still release it which satisfies the GPL requirements. Grsec is creating a derivative work of GPL&#39;d kernel code and then coercing customers to relinquish their freedoms. 

Reminder: if it wasn&#39;t for the GPL they wouldn&#39;t have a codebase to secure in the first place. if they hate copy-left for being too permissive then they can feel free to fork a BSD kernel and copyright the hardened copy they make.

I think most can agree about where those GPL violators should stick their baton but I think there is a good side to all this. Its a painful reminder that unless code is mainlined and project&#39;s contributions are up-streamed its only a matter of time before they disappear and the code is lost. 

No doubt this will catalyze KSPP and bring more security to everyone instead of a select few who know how to tweak and compile a kernel. Another side effect is that protections will be rolled out for many more archs than with grsec support only covering x86 and x64.

Its worth reading Kees Cook&#39;s (KSPP project leader) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/02/4&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; answering common accusations made by Spender and PaXTeam and parroted by their supporters who blame everyone else except their idols who stabbed them in the back.

Unlike the biased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grsecurity.net/compare.php&quot;&gt;comparison&lt;/a&gt; on the grsec site, it seems KSPP has successfully integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Hardened_Kernel_Project#Progress_tracking&quot;&gt;more features&lt;/a&gt; than they were credited. Much work still remains to be done but its definitely a good start. Its becoming clear that the real reason they closed their sources is in a desperate attempt to not become obsolete.

The Gentoo devs feel &lt;a href=&quot;https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-hardened/message/a06145056b167f52c079bffd9c9a51ac&quot;&gt;particularly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-hardened/message/114efeb4f24d7c97b5b450781503d7e6&quot;&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt; after dedicating lots of effort modifying their userland code to be compatible with PaX and being left out in the cold without warning.

This spawned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Hardened_Kernel_Project&quot;&gt;Hardened Kernel Project&lt;/a&gt; an emerging multi-distro (Gentoo, Arch and hopefully Debian) effort to help upstream as much code as possible. If you write kernel code this project can really use your help.</description>

            <p>“They threaten to terminate their access to the patches if they distribute the copylefted code to anyone else - violating the GPL’s freedoms that protect that right.”</p>
<p>Interesting,are there any consequences,for these actions?Such as them having to go to court or something?</p>
<p>I also forgot to ask but when you said</p>
<p>“So he started a bogus trademark suit against a mega-coproration, what could possibly go wrong? (Bogus because Intel never modified grsec extensively to warrant a name change).”</p>
<p>were you refering to when pax said this</p>
<p>“all was well until a few years ago when we learned of several<br>
blatant copyright violations (not of just our code but by extension<br>
that of the upstream kernel too) and also trademark violations.<br>
pursuing these wasn’t too successful and in order to prevent<br>
further abuse we decided to stop the public distribution of<br>
our stable patches and provide it as an entirely commercial<br>
product from then on (all still under the GPL, despite much<br>
speculation to the contrary).”</p>
<p>And whats you’re input on this?</p>
<p>“so what do we have so far about this KSPP business? Google and<br>
other companies made a decision to get our work upstream using<br>
their own resources only - so far so good, it’s their business<br>
in every sense of the word. not involving us however turned out to<br>
be an unwise decision when they realized that their employees are<br>
completely unprepared for this work (we’ll discuss some examples<br>
later). this then led to all kinds of social engineering attempts<br>
at trying to get us to help them out - all without getting paid<br>
for our time, as if we were just supposed to drop all other work<br>
and spend our free time on fixing their botched up attempts. as<br>
if this still wasn’t disgusting and outragous enough, they went<br>
on the combative and had the guts to accuse us of not wanting<br>
to cooperate without also mentioning that they expected all this<br>
work from us for free taken away from our free time.”</p>

<p>Yes. BSD is permissively licensed meaning legally anyone can take their code and release it under a proprietary license like Apple, Sony and Juniper does.

<p>I have heard the term up streaming  many times its where to my understanding a project is open sourced and people (community)  can review any possible errors or exploits and show their findings to the developer team and suggest a patch to them?An example would be Mozilla firefox or Tor to my understandings</p>

<p>Source? The open source community is not a company. Its a group of cooperative developers. Some companies sponsor this group under the Linux Foundation but do not have a say in how the kernel is developed. This is based on meritocracy and coding standards enforced by lead devs with git access like Linus.</p>
<p>FYI Spender repeated many times that they are not interested in taking the time upstream their patchset, paid or not.</p>

            <p>Ah the “no one is compensating us” fallacy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PaXTeam wants to get paid for work he never applied for. The way the normal world works is you apply to a company for a job position and they chose to hire you. What most companies don’t do is chase after you to shower you with money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone’s a bitter hypocrite. He seems to desperately want the money of the Linux Foundation who he’s been shitting on and criticizing for years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he can’t get a job for over a decade when he writes such complex software, then maybe he should take a hard, long look why. Its anybody’s guess but my money is on his asshole attitude making him a non-viable candidate. No one wants to hire autistic manchildren who can’t work in a team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he doesn’t think the copyleft license is good enough, he has other options. No one is forcing him to invest time hacking on a code base that anybody else can use with the requirement that changes are given back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most likely conclusion: PaXTeam is not really interested in getting a job with Google. He wants to create a strawman justifying the their latest douchebagery. Why should he get paid to upstream stuff once when he can keep making money in perpetuity off the subscription model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel doesn’t wanna pay me REEEEE. Before closing their patches Spender attempted to twist Intel’s arm to pay him support fees. So he started a bogus trademark suit against a mega-coproration, what could possibly go wrong? (Bogus because Intel never modified grsec extensively to warrant a name change).</p>

<p>Before that they did the “we aren’t getting enough donations so we’re closing down” routine. Twice. In 2004 <a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/story/04/05/31/1949241/end-of-development-for-grsecurity-announced">https://developers.slashdot.org/story/04/05/31/1949241/end-of-development-for-grsecurity-announced</a> and 2009 <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/313767/">https://lwn.net/Articles/313767/</a> There were many earlier signs that things would end this way. I’m surprised it took that long.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move unto the next part, his technical gobbledygook criticism of KSPP:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Understanding people’s code is very hard. So hard that people prefer to rewrite their own alternatives from scratch. If KSPP is struggling to understand a few things in a massive undocumented patch - that’s not their fault. I think they would have been better off not basing off grsec at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should take what PaXTeam says at face value. Sometimes there are differing opinions on the best way to technically implement things. You would understand this if you read the mail list and see how patches are constantly revised. He also self-contradicts:<br>
<a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/11/10">http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/11/10</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still using the opportunity to differentiate his codebase - that no one can see or use when now everybody stopped giving a shit and moved on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are plenty of other competent people working to improve KSPP now. This time kernel security will improve without being hostage to the tantrums of two assholes : <a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/11/8">http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/11/8</a></p>

</ul>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p><small>Originally published at:			<a href="https://www.whonix.org/blog/beyond-grsecurity-future-linux-security-brighter-ever">https://www.whonix.org/blog/beyond-grsecurity-future-linux-security-brighter-ever</a><br>
</small><br>Those of us following security news have heard about grsec’s <a href="https://grsecurity.net/passing_the_baton_faq.php">decision</a> by now.</p>
<p>If you are a current grsec sponsor reading this who doesn’t like their de-facto violation of kernel code licensing, I urge you to privately leak updated versions to Kees Cook (<a href="mailto:keescook@chromium.org">keescook@chromium.org</a>) who can study and incorporate the code into mainline without endangering your access. This will free changes back to the community where they belong and in the long-term you won’t be forced to pay through the nose to run a secure kernel.</p>
<p>PaXTeam is making a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/721274/">false equivalency</a> between their hostile actions and RedHat licensing. To be clear, the GPL does not restrict monetizing software. However businesses can still make handsome profits working around the license by providing support services. RedHat releases back source code - though not in the neat broken up patch-sets but they still release it which satisfies the GPL requirements. Grsec is creating a derivative work of GPL’d kernel code and then coercing customers to relinquish their freedoms.</p>
<p>Reminder: if it wasn’t for the GPL they wouldn’t have a codebase to secure in the first place. if they hate copy-left for being too permissive then they can feel free to fork a BSD kernel and copyright the hardened copy they make.</p>
<p>I think most can agree about where those GPL violators should stick their baton but I think there is a good side to all this. Its a painful reminder that unless code is mainlined and project’s contributions are up-streamed its only a matter of time before they disappear and the code is lost.</p>
<p>No doubt this will catalyze KSPP and bring more security to everyone instead of a select few who know how to tweak and compile a kernel. Another side effect is that protections will be rolled out for many more archs than with grsec support only covering x86 and x64.</p>
<p>Its worth reading Kees Cook’s (KSPP project leader) <a href="http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/05/02/4">statement</a> answering common accusations made by Spender and PaXTeam and parroted by their supporters who blame everyone else except their idols who stabbed them in the back.</p>
<p>Unlike the biased <a href="https://www.grsecurity.net/compare.php">comparison</a> on the grsec site, it seems KSPP has successfully integrated <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Hardened_Kernel_Project#Progress_tracking">more features</a> than they were credited. Much work still remains to be done but its definitely a good start. Its becoming clear that the real reason they closed their sources is in a desperate attempt to not become obsolete.</p>
<p>The Gentoo devs feel <a href="https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-hardened/message/a06145056b167f52c079bffd9c9a51ac">particularly</a> <a href="https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-hardened/message/114efeb4f24d7c97b5b450781503d7e6">betrayed</a> after dedicating lots of effort modifying their userland code to be compatible with PaX and being left out in the cold without warning.</p>
<p>This spawned the <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Hardened_Kernel_Project">Hardened Kernel Project</a> an emerging multi-distro (Gentoo, Arch and hopefully Debian) effort to help upstream as much code as possible. If you write kernel code this project can really use your help.</p>
