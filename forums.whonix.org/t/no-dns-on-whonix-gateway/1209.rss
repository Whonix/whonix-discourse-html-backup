    <title>No DNS on Whonix-Gateway</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/no-dns-on-whonix-gateway/1209</link>
    <description>I think I have broken something on whonix-gateway, all uwt wrapped apps on whonix-gateway cant resolve dns hostnames. My /etc/resolv.conf is empty, it cant resolve hostnames on clearnet user either.

What tor port uwt wrapper on whonix gateway uses to resolve dns? Maybe I had ovveriden that port in /etc/tor/torrc...
Where else should I look to fix that problem?

I need that because I need to install &quot;vnstat&quot; traffic counter on whonix gateway, but neither apt-get nor any other network app cant resolve dns names now.

Whonix-workstation working well though

P.S. I am using bare-metal configuration without VM, so it&#39;s likely that I have broken something. Anyway it WAS working just after installation.</description>

<p>I wouldn’t use any apt repositories unless they are provided by the Whonix devs. You don’t really know what you’re using!</p>

Tor usability issue. User syntax error. Relevant info here:

Will be lost after upgrade of Tor.

9.6 no longer supported.

Dunno what you mean.

Probably not.

Quite possible. torrc syntax is non-trivial, see:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/15261
<p>Remove your custom settings back and forth to see if that it is.</p>

            <p>BTW I needed to enable IP forwarding. I know what I am doing but you can still warn me in case you think I missed something. I have tested firewall with IP forwarding enabled and found no leaks (it rejects FORWARD chain from eth1, so I guess disabled IP forwarding is just additional layer of security but not critical).</p>
<p>And now I noticed that not only DNS but also any internet connections on whonix-gateway are not working</p>
<p>May ip_forward=1 be the problem?</p>
