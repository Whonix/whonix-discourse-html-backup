    <description>Signing now is not possible and results with a message
&quot;Signing not possible: bad passphrase or missing key&quot;

This seems to be a bug that re-appeared recently

            <p>Please state the steps you are taking <strong>exactly</strong> so I can try to reproduce the issue. (You are talking about KGpg GUI and not gpg CLI right?)</p>
<p>Here’s what works for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>File -&gt; Open Editor</li>
<li>Type in a test message.</li>
<li>Click Sign/Verify</li>
<li>Choose Private Key from Dialog</li>
<li>Signed message appears</li>
</ol>

            <p>Now freshly upgraded to whonix 13 I still can’t sign.<br>
Everything else works fine.</p>
<p>Signing doesn’t even ask for password before throwing that message “Signing not possible: bad passphrase or missing key”</p>
<p>Searching the web this bug seems to be known but very rare and hard to reproduce. I thought more whonix users will be affected since I haven’t changed much in the fresh install and have it.</p>

            <p>Just a follow up. Updating to whonix 12 doesn’t fix it as expected as there is nothing updated related to that.<br>
This is the latest version of kgpg and we are I suppose at the devs mercy on this one.</p>
<p>In case someone else has the same problem (pretty much every whonix user should have) feel free to post here.</p>
