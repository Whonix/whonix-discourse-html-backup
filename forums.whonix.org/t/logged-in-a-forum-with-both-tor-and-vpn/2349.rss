    <title>Logged in a forum with both tor and vpn</title>

    <description>Hello
I always have logged in a forum(debian.org) with vpn(I have also noscript and duckduckgo) but unfortunately this time I had the need to log when I was in whonix. Now can anybody associate me to the use of Whonix/Tor?

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>Yes, the moderators of the forum in question are able to see that you are using Tor by matching the IP of the exit node you used with a public list of exit nodes.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
