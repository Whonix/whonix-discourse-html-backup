    <title>Back with some free time available</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/back-with-some-free-time-available/7681</link>
    <description>Thought I&#39;d post here instead of hijacking an existing thread.
So after a few months of inactivity I have some spare time available.
I am mainly involved in the following projects:
* Whonix Live Desktop Installer
* XFCE theming

@Patrick how best should I proceed? Pull requests on github? More testing? Taking open tickets? I thought I could start with XFCE theming, the easiest part. Should I make pull requests on github?</description>

<p>Great!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That would be excellent. (Btw no adamancy about pull requests / github.<br>
Just usual process but not mandatory. Git branches anywhere would work<br>
to. Decision of taste.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>testing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what needs testing currently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taking open tickets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more excellent (results in pull requests too).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sounds great!</p>
<p>Yeah. Indeed. What’s missing most is source code / pull requests.</p>
