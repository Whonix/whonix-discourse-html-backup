    <description>I am not comparing myself with Linus but the issue is a similar one.

<p>Right, so, very quickly we see political events occurring externally influencing internal events here.<br>
I believe the marcom term for that is “off-brand” or in politics “off-message.”</p>
<p>I’m finding it hard to succinctly convey the concept, but it’s of great importance.</p>
<p>Message is vitally important for scaling. After all, ideas, beliefs, values - when in a decentralized structure such as this - it’s the thoughts we share that bind us. I personally enjoy how Qubes has worked their philosophy into the very roots of the organization. I was exposed to it before even downloading an image.</p>
<p>“Mistrust the infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Philosophy, Principles, and Policies - I guess? I don’t know I just wrote that.</p>

            <p>Good reads. One thing that I believe is harmful to software projects, including Linux and its subcategories, is the adoption of so called “Codes of Conduct” . When an organization begins to do things like hire someone just because they think they have to represent a certain group, lifestyle, ideology or whatever, ultimately the project suffers. Contributors should only ever be considered based on their ability to perform the needed tasks skillfully. So-called “social justice” has absolutely NO place in development.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Linux is still very successful though. I suppose this falls into general organizational structure and the “business management” field of study.</p>
<p>Something I’ve learned about the birth of an organization: They incredibly frequently start as a one-man or one-woman mission. This correlates to all kinds of organizations. Usually, someone has a vision, an idea, funding, and starts convincing others… etc etc. Even if it’s not one, it’s usually a small group - so instead of a kingdom we have an oligarchy.</p>
<p>The problem is that founding an organization isn’t the same skill-set as presiding over one, but even if the founder(s) maintain successful control, eventually they must leave. The problem is - how do you replace yourself? Typically that’s impossible to create a perfect replacement, so the founder’s role is split up into several, and the founder will ‘hire and fire’ as a sort of transitional phase. The founder-CEO may have a cult of personality, and be effectively impossible to replace.</p>
<p>So with video gaming guilds, companies, or even governments, a huge question to answer is: will it outlive it’s founders? Frequently it will not. Monarchy did not fail because of good Kings, it failed because of bad ones, and I believe that policies, structure, and a transition of power from single executives to a larger community-based leadership historically stands the test of time. However, that’s why we see stuff like constitutions, policies, bylaws, etc.</p>
<p>I think Linux has founder’s syndrome. Debian has a distribution of power that has a higher likelihood of outliving Linux in that way.</p>
<p>Apologies if my post sounded grandiose or whatever, I just love studying organizations and how they mature and develop, and for some reason I’m seeing a link there. I started an organization at one point so I was immersed in this stuff.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I think this steps into a field of study, but there’s a lot of info out there. Also getting here means the project must already have grown so much. A good problem to have, right?</p>

            <p>I haven’t even read a lot about his issue an potential solutions myself yet.</p>
<p>Others (Debian and other Linux distributions) managed to scale (more or less) but these solutions might not be portable to Whonix since most contributors wish to stay pseudonymous.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am also listening <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/selfish_contributor/">https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/selfish_contributor/</a> which also talks about this issue. He said that for a while the rule was “for every feature you want to merge, you need to review two other features” and other ways trying to handle this which he thinks are bad.</p>

Many, many Live system projects — including a few ones that aimed at enhancing their users’ privacy — have lived fast and died young. We explain this by their being one wo/man efforts, as well as design decisions that made their maintenance much too costly timewise and energywise. 
We want Tails to live as long as it is needed: Tails is not meant to be solely a pet project.
