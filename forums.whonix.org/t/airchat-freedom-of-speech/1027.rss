    <description>did anyone have looked for this project from lulzlabs:-

https://github.com/lulzlabs/AirChat/

(true it looks kinda dead) but i hope someone make this real and effective.

i liked these statements:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;Because we strongly believe communications should be free, Free as much as the air itself and all the waves should be. Free for everyone everywhere, free for those oppressed, free for the poor, free for the dissident, free for those living out of the boundaries of the infrastructure created for those who were lucky enough to have more than others&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and this:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;People who were protesting against their govt resulting in the their internet being cut off. Even worse govt decided to fuck with their cellphones networks too&lt;/blockquote&gt;

also here is a Code Review:-
