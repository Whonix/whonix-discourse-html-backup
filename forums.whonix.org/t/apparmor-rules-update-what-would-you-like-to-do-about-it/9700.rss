    <description>When I update it ask 

    Setting up sdwdate (3:10.2-1) ...

    Configuration file &#39;/etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.sdwdate&#39;
     ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
     ==&gt; Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
       What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
        Y or I  : install the package maintainer&#39;s version
        N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
          D     : show the differences between the versions
          Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
     The default action is to keep your current version.
    *** usr.bin.sdwdate (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? 

    Configuration file &#39;/etc/apparmor.d/whonix-firewall&#39;
     ==&gt; Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
