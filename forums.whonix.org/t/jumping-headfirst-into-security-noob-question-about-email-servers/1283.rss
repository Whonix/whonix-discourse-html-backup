    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/jumping-headfirst-into-security-noob-question-about-email-servers/1283</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure there are more appropriate places to ask this, but I just started using whonix and while I&#39;m here I thought you guys would know how to help with this. If you&#39;ve got a few minutes to explain it to a noobie I&#39;d really appreciate the help.

I want to send and receive email @ my own .onion address. If I understand correctly hosting a hidden service is a simple as running the web server as normal for clearnet and then pointing tor at it. But are there extra complications for email? I know it&#39;s a weird old protocol. Can I just run my MTA/MDA on the server as normal? Someone said something about pointing my email server applications at SOCKS? How would I do this?

Thanks a ton in advance for any help!

p.s. I know pointing a MUA like thunderbird at onion email is tricky, that&#39;s okay, webmail is fine.</description>

            <p>Oh, wow, that pdf looks great! Just what I was hoping for. I’ll try to puzzle through it, but in the meantime do you have any sage advice about it? Or (dare I ask) would you be willing to sit in a chat with me and hold my hand through setting it up? At the risk of being crass I could pay a bit of BTC for your time.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I just found this:  <a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/A_Debian_package_for_SMTP_via_Tor__aka_SMTorP__using_exim4.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/A_Debian_package_for_SMTP_via_Tor__aka_SMTorP__using_exim4.html</a></p>
<p>It looks really promising- what do you think? Should I be able to do this on whonix?<br>
I feel very close to understanding this myself, but I’m just not quite there.</p>

They <em>might</em> work better.<p></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>But if you want only Tor to Tor communication, I mean who many people have such an obscure setup…  Why e-mail?</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Using Tor hidden services it could be difficult. Because e-mail usually require MX DNS. Tor does not support those yet. (<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7829</a>) I am not aware of someone having done this setup.</p>
<p>Mixmaster is similar to e-mail. When I documented it back then, this was quite difficult. You <em>might</em> find some interesting pointers here:</p>

<p>Onioncat <em>might</em> help (all parties need this, but in your setup, all parties need that anyhow):<br>

<p>You can also try asking on the tor-talk mailing list since this is mostly Whonix unspecific.</p>
<p>After having written this, I just typed “e-mail onion” into Google. Did you try that? Found this pdf, didn’t test:<br>

            <p>An important thing to consider. If this setup succeeds at all, you would only be reachable by people who are using Tor and/or who are using mail servers that also are talking Tor.</p>
<p>Someone from clearnet couldn’t send you an e-mail. Just as clearnet users cannot browse .onion addresses. There are services such as tor2web, but it’s “2web”, not “to e-mail” or “to anything”.</p>
<p>Have you considered this?</p>
