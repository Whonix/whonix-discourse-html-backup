    <title>Screen resize resolution bug</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/screen-resize-resolution-bug/8990</link>
    <description>I know that it&#39;s a very known bug but I cannot resize VirtualBox machine window, the resolution of Whonix Gateway and Workstation remain the same. The only working solution for me is to force resolution through &quot;Virtual screen 1&quot;, but real-time changing resolution is not working. And even when i manually set Whonix resolution through &quot;Virtual screen 1&quot;, from time to time screen size not changing at all, so I often need to restart Whonix instances in order to change resolution to manually set.</description>
