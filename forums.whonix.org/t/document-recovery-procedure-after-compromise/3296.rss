    <description>Continuing the discussion from [apt-get upgrading security issue CVE-2016-1252](https://forums.whonix.org/t/apt-get-upgrading-security-issue-cve-2016-1252/3288/11):

[quote=&quot;Patrick, post:11, topic:3288&quot;]
I don&#39;t think we have documented a full compromise recovery procedure anywhere.
[/quote]

To my knowledge, Qubes has never recommended any kind of recovery / reinstall related to any Qubes QSBs. What would be the criteria for such a recommendation?

* critical security bug + non-targeted, rampant attacks in the wild
* critical security bug + confirmed targeted attacks + you being a high-value target
* any paranoid user
* ???

We might need 2 recovery procedures (though it would be impossible to know which to apply):

* Full-compromise recovery procedure (including dom0)
* Limited-compromise recovery procedure (non-hypervisor, domU only)

In event of compromise, would not recommend preserving any persistent filesystems. Better to manually migrate individual files after full reinstall / template reinstall.</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>A compromised Gateway has no access to the host resources. Both the Gateway and the Workstation should be considered compromised along with any data that it contains or is in shared folders it can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implies so, but a compromised gateway doesn’t automatically lead to a compromised workstation.</p>
<p>Let’s say a remote code execution vulnerability was found in Tor. That would compromise Tor but a compromised Tor only leads to the following breaches for the workstation:</p>
<ul>
<li>reading (non-https) clearnet traffic originating from the workstation (unless the workstation is using a user -&gt; Tor -&gt; VPN -&gt; destination tunnel configuration)</li>
<li>reading onion traffic originating from the workstation</li>
<li>loss of anonymity</li>
</ul>
<p>The gateway is no more privileged position to exploit the workstation than a Tor exit. Well, it doesn’t have to find a specific target, but it still requires to compromise the workstation through another vulnerability.</p>
<p>A compromised gateway shouldn’t lead to a compromised (as in unwanted code, malware running) workstation. So the workstation shared folder should be safe along with any data locally stored and never transmitted unencrypted over the internet. So any OpenPGP encrypted messages from the workstation sent through a compromised gateway should still be confidential.</p>

            <p>None of this is very realistic. I don’t expect a high share of users being even aware of this or capable to apply these steps or even have the motivation/resources to apply these steps.</p>
<hr>
<p>It’s in the spirit of Advanced Security Guide to also mentioning things which are difficult, even if we can’t document them fully.</p>
<p>Starting with the least secure up to the most secure way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>powered on internet connected compromised machines</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>powered on LAN connected compromised machines</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>powered on machines without connectivity (shared folder for VM or USB for host)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>powered off machines and mount</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li>the Qubes method</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(<code>machines</code> shall be somehow a term that can mean both real hardware or VM, unless there is a better term.)</p>
<hr>
<p>We should probably distinguish between considering hardware compromise and host compromise.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>the malicious USB device, 2) malformed partitions or other volume meta-data, and 3) malformed filesystem metadata.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If one is worried malicious USB, the best option can only be Qubes since it supports USBVM.</p>
<p>If one is worried about <code>malformed partitions or other volume meta-data, and 3) malformed filesystem metadata</code>, then best option can only be Qubes since it allows to restore AppVMs on a fresh Qubes installation in a safe way, and the virtual disks of these VMs can then be mounted and then <code>By using Qubes secure file copy operation. Specifically the user might copy the whole home directory to a new AppVM, and then analyze, verify and start using (the verified) data in a new, non-compromised AppVM:</code></p>
<p>So for one section, hardware compromise could be mentioned but out of scope. And for another section issues with mount could be mentioned but out of scope.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Threat model: You know or highly suspect that the Gateway is compromised, but there was no VM breakout.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A compromised Gateway has no access to the host resources. Only the Workstation should be considered compromised along with any data that it contains or is in shared folders it can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is still confusing me. <code>highly suspect that the **Gateway** is compromised</code> but then be told <code>**Only** the **Workstation** should be considered compromised</code>.</p>

            <p>Risk of booting a malicious VM without internet connected:</p>
<ul>
<li>if internet is considered off for too long: malware might react on this trigger such as by deleting files or maliciously editing files (adding fabricated evidence)</li>
<li>or do some action to damage the hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>Risks of keeping internet connected when being compromised:</p>
<ul>
<li>malware can load more code and the newer code might include stuff for infecting more hardware or VM breakout</li>
<li>exfiltration may not be a binary yes/no. Could be something in between. Imagine a malware where the attacker remotely is searching one by one (there are screenshots/videos available about malware features). Not all attackers straight fetch a whole image dump. Malware might upload more files: upload over Tor is slow. Depending when one noticed the compromise, specifically with lots of data (lets say video recordings) not everything may be in the hands of the attacker yet.</li>
<li>the attacker might upload illegal files (non-torified) somewhere that result in a police raid</li>
<li>the attacker might come up with a new strategy such as uploading false evidence files to the victim’s computer and then tip the authorities resulting in a police raid and false accusation</li>
<li>when a malicious computer is connected, it might do nefarious work such as for a spam botnet</li>
<li>the longer it’s connected to the internet (image a user following that advice and taking days for searching all the data and making backups) it’s harder to explain (think in front of a judge) that “my computer was compromised, it wasn’t me” vs “your computer was used in an attack for days”.</li>
</ul>
<p>See this image to see what compromised computers are used for: <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HackedPC2012.png" rel="nofollow noopener">https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HackedPC2012.png</a></p>
<p>You’ll want none of this. So: don’t connect a compromised VM or machine to the internet.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why not? Considering exfiltration has already happened what are we protecting the infected machine from? If not the network then the HDD Needs to be taken out and put in a USB enclosure to be connected offline from the clean machine. This brings up another set of problems that can also lead to infection. At least with the network we can have higher chances of keeping the new machine trustworthy. Also the forensic method is not accessible to most people.</p>

<p>shared folder</p>

<p>Doesn’t apply to Qubes and could use links to existing documentation for virtualizer specific instructions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on your compromised machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shouldn’t be done or at least this should be considered a less secure option. With forensics and malware infections:</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t continue to power on the hardware again</li>
<li>make an image and copy of that image before working with the image</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Connect new external storage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know what you mean but many users probably won’t. Needs to be clarified a bit what is considered new, i.e. not the ones connected to the infected host and why, to prevent BadUSB.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>untrusted external USB or HDDs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as above. Untrusted probably meaning: no data stored on it that you care about or wiped beforehand, and knowing that this device can never be connected again to any non-compromised computer. Perhaps trusted/untrusted doesn’t describe it well? Perhaps better compromised/non-compromised or infected/uninfected? The previously uninfected HDD should be considered infected after being connected to a malicious machine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Threat model: You know or highly suspect that the Workstation is compromised, but there was no VM breakout.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Transfer your data out of the Workstation via shred folder.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>If so: remove internet connection first.</p>
<p>But then still applies: It is easier but not the most secure option.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Threat model: You know or highly suspect that the Gateway is compromised, but there was no VM breakout.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A compromised Gateway has no access to the host resources. Only the Workstation should be considered compromised along with any data that it contains or is in shared folders it can access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why should the workstation be considered compromised? By mistake wrote workstation but meant gateway?</p>

<p>Confirmed. No services or ports from the host are visible via NAT network.</p>

<p>Considering the complexity and the number of things that can go wrong with USB, I changed the guide to use Onionshare which is much safer and manageable for users. I also tried to simplify the workflow of dealing with suspected files. Opinion?</p>

<p>No, it can’t access any host services. VM breakout exploit required.</p>
<p>It’s a reasonable compromise to sometimes consider a Whonix-Workstation<br>
compromised but nothing else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about Qubes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same from theoretic point of view but much stronger separation by<br>
virtualizer. So no different documentation required regarding various<br>
levels of compromise.</p>

<p>Good point. Do you know how this is done?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Malware is just a program that can do whatever it wants. There could be<br>
a logic “if my runtime after start on this machine is low (so probably<br>
shutdown after infection) do more damage by deleting files”. Or another<br>
logic “if not internet access for too long, start deleting files”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It will involve connecting the device though. So is not mounting it enough?</p>

<p>Mounting is for sure far safer than booting.</p>

<p>Connecting USB to host is only of if host is considered to be uncompromised. Otherwise malware could infect the USB hardware (firmware part, not storage) and spread elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes. Was this not clear? It shouldn’t propagate if USB redirection is used properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think any users heard of USB redirection. And if that works,<br>
once we consider USB firmware compromise then such a USB controller<br>
would have forever not be connected to any VM or host that isn’t<br>
supposed to be compromised.</p>
<p>The only way USB could be used to take data from a compromised VM is if<br>
provided to a VM as a blockdevice without exposing the USB<br>
controller/firmware like Qubes is doing. But in case of Qubes, no need<br>
for USB, qvm-copy would do.</p>

<p>I guess this is useful if you care about recovering from compromised VMs only, but the easier way for this is to simply transfer the files you care about out thru shared folder and delete it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easier yes, but shared folders require the VM to be booted. And booting<br>
a VM is far less secure than mounting.</p>
<p>If booting a VM: make a copy first in case the malware starts to destroy<br>
files. Also disconnect internet from the VM first so the malware cannot<br>
load new modules (with new exploit code) or do other malicious stuff online.</p>

<p>Plaintext files are the easiest and safest to recover. These shouldn’t just be copied to another machine and opened there using a usual editor. Better to copy and paste its contents from one VM to another. This is to get rid of any malicious code attachments hidden in the plaintext file.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Interesting. Please add. What do you mean by code attachments? Is there an example we can point to?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s non-malicious pdf files and malicious pdf files. Any<br>
non-malicious pdf file can be converted into a malicious pdf file by<br>
modifying it. I am calling this sloppy “code attachment”. Perhaps better<br>
“malicious modification”: Pdf readers are known to have sometimes<br>
vulnerabilities reported about them. Maliciously crafted pdf files can<br>
exploit pdf viewers, i.e. execute code even if pdf files shouldn’t<br>
result in code execution.</p>
<p>There’s been also vulnerabilities found in text editors already, perhaps<br>
even in connection with text files. I am not sure it happen in practice<br>
yet or if it happen only on Windows yet. Search engines indicate it<br>
happened in the Windows world. Nevertheless, theoretically it’s<br>
possible. Parsing a pdf file and parsing a text file to show its<br>
contents is basically the same, code parsing data, just that parsing a<br>
pdf file is much more complex. This is because text editors interpret<br>
the contents of text files. The more feature rich the text editor, the<br>
more likely some parsing of the text file can lead to a code execution<br>
vulnerability.</p>
<p>Another example would be <code>cat</code>. There’s been vulnerabilities in<br>
terminal-emulators before. The simplest example of a malicious text file<br>
would be if the victim will use <code>cat</code> on a text file and exploit a new<br>
terminal-emulator vulnerability.</p>
<p>More sophisticated malware is known to infect (make malicious<br>
modifications) to other files so a reinfection is likely once someone<br>
reinstall and then reuses their data. That should be pointed out.</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

recovery would go through the pain of trashing all of their data and<br>

            <p>I talked to Marek (Qubes lead developer) - in try to summarize it from memory in my own: Even if he was paid to look several months into it. if not knowing what kind of backdoor one is looking for, it is just impossible to verify that a system is malware free.

<p>Any outgoing protocol / communication just needs a tiny modification such as different delays (that are otherwise somewhat random) are enough to encode unwanted outgoing information leaks.</p>
