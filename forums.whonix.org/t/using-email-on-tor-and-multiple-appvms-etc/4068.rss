    <title>Using Email on Tor and multiple AppVMs etc</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/using-email-on-tor-and-multiple-appvms-etc/4068</link>
    <description>Would using Gmail by itself in a separate AppVM running concurrently with another AppVM for webbrowsing  add anything to one&#39;s  anonymity - security ?

I&#39;m thinking it may not matter how the email gets to and from Gmail, over HTTPS? 

And the occasional  &quot;check mail&quot; from Thunderbird (for gmail) if anything could allow the two AppVMs  to be correlated   in a worse case scenario.

not that &quot;I have anything to hide&quot; just curious on the mechanics of best practice

Maybe the same goes for   using any email  while on TBB , Tor ,  e.g say I logged on to a hidden protonmail service  in the SAME AppVM  as I do my web browsing,  would  it be  better to do  the logging  on  to protonmail  in a stand alone  AppVM   .......or is this just pretty pointless  if one doesn&#39;t have any big &#39;adversary&#39; that they know of ?</description>

</aside>
<p>Using Tor will not help with anonymity if you log into a Gmail account that is associated with your actual identity. Security wise, it would be beneficial to use an appVM for untrusted activities like web browsing and a separate appVM for applications like thunderbird/Gmail. This way if your browser appVM is compromised your other appVMs would not be affected.</p>

<p>Whonix uses <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation">stream isolation</a> to protect against identity correlation.<br>
However, if you are checking your personal Gmail account (they obviously know its you) with one appVM and using another to log into a site that is associated  with you could be used for correlation.</p>

<p>I think using a separate appVM for web browsing and for checking email would suffice. The following page may answer some of your questions</p>
