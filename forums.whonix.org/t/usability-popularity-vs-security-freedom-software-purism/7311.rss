    <description>Continuing the discussion from [disable speaker by default or optional for better security?](https://forums.whonix.org/t/disable-speaker-by-default-or-optional-for-better-security/7294):

It is a question about right balance between two strategies.

The most security focused approach is:

* `A)` &quot;Whonix&quot; hardened gentoo based - don&#39;t care about any laymen who will fail at usability. A way to run a &quot;project&quot; would be &quot;only use this for myself and don&#39;t bother telling anyone&quot;. Perhaps have a blog post that very few read let alone apply about how to set up that somewhere but then that&#39;s about it.

The most reward focused approach is:

* `B)` Perhaps some proprietary Windows only tool or perhaps even non-security related software or service.

With Whonix the goal is the right balance.

* Protecting some/as many as possible situations in [real world](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Security_in_Real_World).
* Sizable user base. Having two users only isn&#39;t rewarding. Popularity requires usability. Project growth. Impact.
* Popularity leading to review, contributions.
* Don&#39;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
* Don&#39;t try to make everyone happy.
* Realism, non-fatalism, reasonability, feasibility, sustainable development.

If one follows mostly strategy `A)` then the outcome of that is &quot;only&quot; a guide [such as this](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy). I could have used that for myself and then call it a day. Yet, a project, Whonix emerged from that. Without the popularity based approach, people would have never learned about Whonix. People wouldn&#39;t have contributed research, documentation, review and source code. Whonix project certainly contributed inspiration to make create and improved approach of approach `A)`.

As an analogy, is it useful to have a super secure window while at the same time it&#39;s infeasible to secure the front door. Some argue to do everything to super secure the window even if securing the front door isn&#39;t feasible in foreseeable future. Any security related project naturally attracts people who will argue in favor of security maximalism. Yet, in many cases such as Whonix, these security maximalists wouldn&#39;t have benefited from the research and documentation that was created only as result of non-security maximalists projects which directed focus to the subject.

In case of Whonix, the window could be &quot;compromised VMs communicate through audio output with nearby compromised devices&quot; and the front door could be Tor or Debian (which isn&#39;t using the most security focussed operating system applying as much as compilation hardening flags, kernel hardening, and whatnot by default). There are a lot shortcommings in anonymity/security/privacy which are documented throughout the wiki.

To avoid security maximalist yet reducing sustainability changes, sometimes usability is given priority over security maximalism and [Freedom Software](https://forums.whonix.org/t/lets-call-it-freedom-software-rather-than-free-software-or-open-source/6961) purism ([related](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/nonfree), [forum discussion](https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-host-nonfree-blobs-firmware-linux-nonfree/7251)). 

Security maximalism isn&#39;t my thing. Applying it consistently might lead to fatalism, dropping all but Qubes-Whonix or even `A)`.

I would hope that those who prefer approach `A)`, those who prefer security / Freedom Software purism, security maximalists can still benefit from the Whonix project (documentation, research, source code, discussion) and encourage them to [software fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) Whonix. Existence of different views on #project-philosophy is to be expected. Wikipedia [writes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution):

&gt; Almost six hundred [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) exist, with close to five hundred out of those in active development.  five hundred out of those in active development.

The great thing about Freedom Software is that it encourages cooperation.</description>

But i guess the “project-philosophy” is set in stone so there is no reason to argue with Patrick.<br>
Whonix seams to go the way Tor is going, so be it. Usability over security. The average User(who wont use it) over those who need it.</p>
<p>Time to go<br>

<p>Unfortunately, I’ve spent too much time on this subject already. It’s clear that discussions on <a class="hashtag" href="//forums.whonix.org/tags/project-philosophy">#<span>project-philosophy</span></a> are unsolvable. Positions were made abundantly clear, I think.</p>
<p>By comparison, generally the architects of complex structures like buildings or hardware (and a myriad of other professions) do not explain any technical details or project philosophy in detail for free to the general public.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am closing this forum thread for two weeks for cool down. If someone still can remember it by then and wishes to add to it, feel free to.</p>
<p>Contributors and developers are welcome to e-mail me about this should they think this <a class="hashtag" href="//forums.whonix.org/tags/project-philosophy">#<span>project-philosophy</span></a> is too far off.</p>

            <p>You are wasting your time <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/xariv">@xariv</a> . There are underlying issues here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whonix developers do not use VirtualBox with their own sensitive material. They use KVM or Qubes. They use VitualBox for development, when they have to. As selfless as they can be, and I do trust they are, feeling the risk and considering the risk for others isn’t the same thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whonix developers will probably not suffer dire consequences (in case of being compromised) in relation to what many or at least some of their users will experience. With every honest effort done (again, I do not doubt anyone), they do not really feel the personal fear that is underlying to some posts here. One could argue if that’s good or bad. People under threat would probably be too busy in protecting their own a-- and won’t have time to engage in such long term projects. So I’d say that’s a necessary evil.</p>

Whonix VirtualBox with clipboard disabled by default would result in a web search with answer “it’s not secure to use this but we don’t have a better answer so just enable it anyhow”.</p>

</aside>
<p>If we can afford to drop usability, why can’t we support saying “If you can’t effort the hardware, you have nothing worth to protect anyhow”. That’s the problem with elitism. Once established, where does it stop. Following your suggestions such as wasting effort on X (let’s say VirtualBox) prevents security feature Y would lead to the deprecation of VirtualBox. The Qubes people can say “but it works on my hardware”, why I couldn’t say “it works on my hardware too”. How’s VirtualBox support justified then?</p>

<p>Of course, but as long as it’s regularly monitored by me it’s still an additional attack vector and potential deanonymization threat vs not using any.

<p>No, because I don’t think that’s realistic, and I see a value in a community of users.</p>
<p>I am regularly using at least 3 other forums that don’t require javascript or low TBB security levels and users are very happy with more basic features because they value their security and anonymity.</p>
<p>Reading here can be done without JS. I think you should consider why users post here. It’s normally because they have an issue. This isn’t a place to pass the time (and some of the issues they have is “why JS is required here”).</p>
<p>I guess I will get the same reply of “you are an advanced user and try to restrict others’ usability”. So how about a poll?</p>
<p>Do you prefer:</p>
<ol>
<li>More basic features, with higher security (no javascript required, highest Tor security level possible),</li>
<li>Advanced features, with the risk of fingerprinting and susceptibility to JS and other low-security browser related attacks.</li>

            <p>Let’s take a closer look at clipboard sharing.<br>
My argument is it’s used either by advanced users, or in the wrong way, or correctly but in rare cases.</p>
<p>When should Gateway clipboard be used externally?</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy information from Gateway to Workstation: perhaps when user encounters a problem and wants to copy and paste output to the forum? in this case he already engages with support here. He is a problem solver. Any confusion regarding the clipboard will be easily resolved.</li>
<li>From workstation to gateway, when changing settings, for example Tor bridges, or maybe adding onion grater profiles, and it’s tricky to copy the text char by char? This isn’t an out-of-the-box usage but a higher level. If user gets to do that we can assume he is capable of handling VirtualBox settings as well, or again, capable to engage with support.</li>
</ul>
<p>When is Workstation clipboard used externally?</p>
<ul>
<li>When copying information to the gateway, covered above.</li>
<li>When copying information from one workstation to another. Using multiple VMs in parallel is an relatively advanced activity and we can assume such users are again able to handle clipboard settings.</li>
<li>When copying information from workstation to host. I don’t see how this is generally a good practice, and if anyone needs to do that it is fair to require some (very minimal, really) researching being done.</li>
<li>When copying information from host to workstation. I don’t recall ever doing that. Similarly, rare or wrong.</li>

<p>If there is a way to mitigate that, let’s take it. If not, at least mitigate threats we can. I would assume controlling speakers allows an adversary a higher quality, accuracy and range of transmission than through the LCD coil noise. Besides, with speakers I can think of attacks not even requiring an infected device nearby. For example: an adversary has a good reason to believe you use a public wifi at a certain airport, large cafe, library. He gets there, and make the speakers play a loud alarm sound, or maybe Beethoven. Busted. Other attacks - play a sound provoking the user to take some action. For example, mail arriving, or a false error sound. Perhaps encourage rebooting the system (then reconnect to another AP). I think the possibilities with speakers control are quite larger.</p>

    Quote somewhere on the internet: 

Discourse can be configured in “mailing list mode”, where it sends an email per message, and allows replies the same way as well. Of course, users who find this annoying have an option to either disable emails completely, or switch to daily/weekly digests (similar to GGroups). 

Could this provide a non-JavaScript way to interact with the discourse forums?

</aside>
<p>Here’s the thing. Even an LCD can be a side-channel leaking its displayed contents to nearby mics due to changes in its coil noise according to what’s displayed. This is a practical attack. Things start going off the deep end once all facts are considered. Surely you can’t recommend users going on without a screen to do their computing. Not even a commandline only machine is safe.</p>
<p>Back to the main point. If I was to disable audio - which we still haven’t decided on until Patrick consults the Qubes people, this still leaves other browsers and VMs on the host exposed. If a security minded user were to add it back they would be running round with an open mic if they hadn’t even through to read about this problem.</p>

<p>firewall gui utility</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I did give Qubes firewall as an example but I never intended to ask the Whonix equivalent include any GUI.</p>
<p>A dedicated text file, with rules in a clear syntax will do great, and be more manageable / safer for users to mess with (lower impact of mistakes) than editing iptables or firewall scripts. I’m thinking something that only allows users to add more limitations, never to remove or revise the core Whonix rules.</p>
<p>So we essentially “just” need a script that reads such a file, validates syntax (outputs errors accordingly, or just rejects the file), and  writes the additional restrictions to iptables.</p>

            <p>Not all feature requests are created equal. Pure logic such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>X takes develoment effort</li>
<li>development effort spent on X was a waste because that would have given us Y already</li>
</ul>
<p>is invalid. It ignores the human question. It ignores the available skillset of developers. As you may have noticed, I never created original quality GUI applications but I’ve been capable to modify them. Some things are easy for me (such as this time port from stretch to buster) since I am trained in that (lintian warnings, packaging of simple things scripts, non-compiled code) but to deduce from that I could have equally easy come up from a firewall GUI utility - no.</p>
<p>Quote from FAQ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By comparison, generally the architects of complex structures like buildings or hardware (and a myriad of other professions) do not explain any technical details for free to the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Volunteer contributions to Whonix ™ are most welcome. All proposed patches are carefully reviewed and merged if appropriate. Volunteers with the requisite coding ability should refer to the current backlog of <a href="https://phabricator.whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">open Whonix ™ issues</a> and consult with developers before undertaking any significant body of work.</p>
<p>Often, proposed improvements or fixes to the Whonix ™ platform are awaiting implementation due to differing developer priorities, limited human resources and/or the inordinate amount of time required to develop a particular feature or solution. In a minority of cases, the Whonix ™ team is unsure how to resolve a bug or implement a specific change / feature. <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#cite_note-70" rel="nofollow noopener">[70]</a></p>
<p>It is generally unhelpful to debate the priorities laid out in the future Whonix ™ roadmap, as this diverts energy from core development. Some major suggestions might become available in the long-term or might never eventuate, such as the availability of a Live Whonix ™ CD/DVD.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is essentially also a debate on priorities which is mostly pointless to discuss due to skill limitations and limitations of users to imagine the difficulty of implementing things where pure logic doesn’t apply without technical background knowledge.</p>

I’ve used tcpdump so far in a Workstation, all packets are (as expected) between the Workstation and the Gateway, not easy to find the destination IP. Running it with -A shows http requests with the destination IP however parsing it will probably be less easy with other applications. I suspect I will have a similar issue with wireshark.

<p>In this case I will add more items then when I notice them. Sure, if they can be added as build parameters that will be a big step forward.</p>
<p>I don’t see a fork of a project of this complexity as something that’s going to happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>Agreed. But then if we are talking about potential jail time, then additional measures are to be taken, such as encrypted USB disks, using bridges to connect to Tor, maybe connecting to public Wifi spots (although might not be a good idea in certain circumstances).</p>
<p>What I mean is that if it really is a question of life or death you surely need to be very up-to-date with OPSEC and anonymity topics, merely installing Whonix on Windows and expecting it to cover all your needs out  of the box is unrealistic.</p>

    Agreed. Whonix takes some learning though, for sure, especially if both Whonix and the virtualizer are new to the user. 
End of the day users stay with defaults. The peculiarities in Whonix (no sound by default for example) are well worth some more support tickets if the tradeoff is lower security. Sure, we can instruct users to turn it off themselves / use headphones etc. But if the users read that there’d be no problem in the first place.

<p>A complex topic with no doubt in Whonix. A very easy topic elsewhere:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Tor browser.</li>
<li>Sign up for VPN.</li>
<li>Install VPN app on host.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bang! you got VPN before Tor setting. All done with clicks! No editing of configuration files! No creating users or changing permissions! Not breaking stream isolation (coz they never had it).</p>
<p>This setting is actually a <em>requirement</em> for many Tor users (whether it’s good for them or not it’s another question) - I can promise you the vast majority of them can do the above as I described and will not get into doing the setting in Whonix. Yes we can improve education (wiki) but we should admit that Whonix isn’t for everybody.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A majority of people will go for the easy path. That’s understandable and their own choice. This could also be achievable within Whonix, but it requires some commitment. But it is possible, and documented. So I think we agree it’s the user choice eventually. And yes, Whonix is probably not for everybody or lazy users, but there is nothing that inherently prevents it from being used by anybody.</p>
