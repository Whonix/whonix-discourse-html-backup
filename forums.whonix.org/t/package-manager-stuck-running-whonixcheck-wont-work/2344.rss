    <title>Package manager stuck running whonixcheck won&#39;t work</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/package-manager-stuck-running-whonixcheck-wont-work/2344</link>
    <description>Hello I am running whonix12 on Ubuntu using Virtualbox everything has been working fine until recently.  When I run the Gateway it does the swdate sync but it doesn&#39;t go to #2 connect to tor or #3 whonix check instead it gives me a message saying:

&quot;A package manager (such as apt-get) is currently running.  Waiting for it to finish...
If you are not aware of any package managers running exit now, find out if there are any issues with dpkg or apt-get.  Run in the terminal for example:
sudo dpkg --audit
sudo dpkg --configure -a
and several other commands all of which I have tried.

When I run the workstation I am still able to connect to tor although I am uncomfortable doing so with this message as I fear I am missing a whonixcheck update.  I am very new to this can someone please help me get my whonix working normally??  The above paragraph was typed as I could not copy and paste the message but to answer what it says I have no managers running so I have been exiting and just running tor.  How can I solve this problem??  Would uninstalling and reinstalling whonix 12 fix it??  PLEASE ADVISE.

Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>I tryed updating the VM, and even removing and installing gateway and workstation all over again but the message keep coming back.</p>
<p>The problem is that before, the gateway told me always when its time to update, but now never. It only shows this about the package manager that never loads.</p>
<p>im worried that my anonymity is in danger because of that?</p>
<p>Is it unsafe to surf in the workstation?</p>
<p>How do i get rid of this problem?</p>

<p>It’s unspecific. It’s basically saying “same as in Debian” and then explaining what that means. It’s not a solution but directions to help yourself.</p>

            <p>Worth noticing, whonxicheck is reporting a symptom. It’s not the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>Does this message persist after reboot?</p>
<p>Stop whonixcheck. Try updating that VM as usual. As per<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Update">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Update</a></p>
<p>Then you will likely run into some package manager issue which can be fixed as per:<br>
