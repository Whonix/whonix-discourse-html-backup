    <title>Kax17 Tor Still ok the use?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/kax17-tor-still-ok-the-use/13137</link>
    <description>Hello Guys, I just wanted to ask your opinion on the Kax17 issue. My question is Tor even worth using since there is a big adversary that could be deanonymize users. Is tor still safe to use? because at one point you they had so much tor nodes running that you had a 35% chance of routing your traffic through them. Alot of people are going around and saying its the goverment that is using them since there is such a large amount of tor nodes its kind of concerning. I also wanted to ask how can we protect our selfs from this attack?</description>

            <p>I don’t have a great answer to this. Whonix is a research and implementation project. Downstream from Tor. Simplified, we take existing stable components (operating system, virtualizer, anonymizer), latest understanding and pre-configure it. Should the constituents components of Whonix break down, then Whonix would break down as well and we couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>Could you please redirect this question upstream to The Tor Project?</p>
