    <description>&gt; ## [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org): A High Security Method of Surfing the Internet
&gt; 
&gt; Whonix is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines, providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix is under active development and is the only operating system designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor.

After more than two years of development, the Whonix Project is proud to announce the release of Whonix 14.

Whonix 14 is based on the Debian stretch (Debian 9) distribution which was released in June 2017. This means users have access to many new software packages in concert with existing packages, such as a modern branch of GNuPG, and more. [1][2][3]

**Major Changes and New Features**

Whonix 14 contains extensive security and usability improvements, new features and bug fixes. For a detailed description of these and other changes, please refer to the official release notes. [4]

* Rebased Whonix on **Debian stretch** (Debian 9).
* Whonix 14 is **64-bit** (amd64) only - 32-bit (i386) images will no longer be built and made available for download. [5]
* The new **Anon Connection Wizard** [6] feature in Whonix simplifies connections to the Tor network via a Tor bridge and/or a proxy.
* The Tor pluggable transport **meek_lite** [7] is now supported, making it much easier to connect to the Tor network in heavily censored areas, like China. [8]
* **Onioncircuits** are installed by default in Whonix. [9]
* Tails&#39; **onion-grater** program has been implemented to enable **OnionShare, Ricochet and Zeronet** compatibility with Whonix. [10]
* **Onion sources** are now preferred for Whonix updates/upgrades for greater security.
* Reduced the size of the default, binary Whonix images by approximately **50 per cent** using zerofree. [11] [12]
* **Updated Tor** to version 3.3.9 (stable) release to enable full v3 onion functionality for both hosting of onion services and access to v3 onion addresses in Tor Browser.
* Created the **grub-live package** [13] which can run Whonix as a **live system** on non-Qubes-Whonix platforms. [14]
* Corrected and hardened various **AppArmor profiles** to ensure the correct functioning of Tor Browser, obfsproxy and other applications.

**Other Changes**

* Desktop shortcuts are no longer available in non-Qubes-Whonix. Please use the start menu instead.

**Known Issues**
* OnionShare is not installed by default in Whonix 14 as it is not in the stretch repository. [15] It can still be manually installed by following the Whonix wiki instructions [16] or building it from source code. [17]
* Enabling seccomp (Sandbox 1) in /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf causes the Tor process to crash if a Tor version lower than 0.3.3 is used. [18] [19]


While there may be other issues that exist in this declared stable release, every effort has been made to address major known problems.

Please report any other issues to us in the forums, after first searching for whether it is already known.

  https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Known_Issues

**Download Whonix 14**

Whonix is cross-platform and can be installed on the Windows, macOS, Linux or Qubes operating systems. Choose your operating system from the link below and follow the instructions to install it.

  https://www.whonix.org/download/

**Upgrade to Whonix 14**

Current Whonix users (or those with 32-bit hardware) who would prefer to upgrade their existing Whonix 13 platform should follow the upgrade instructions below.

  https://whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14

**What’s Next?**

Work on Whonix 15 is ongoing and interested users can refer to the roadmap to see where Whonix is heading. [20]

Developer priorities are currently focused on easing the transition to the next Debian release due in 2019 (“buster”; Debian 10) and squashing existing bugs, rather than implementing new features.

We need your help and there are various ways to contribute to Whonix - donating or investing your time will help the project immensely. Come and talk with us! [21]

Through your efforts, Whonix 13 was a success and by and large surpassed all of expectations. With the release of Whonix 14, a decision had to be made as to whether it would be feasible to continue support of Whonix 13. Under ideal circumstances, Whonix developers would continue support of  Whonix 13 for a period of time. Howe…

<hr>
<h1>Whonix 14 has been Released</h1>
<p>After more than two years of development, Whonix version 14, the popular anonymity-focused linux distro, has been released.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/t/whonix-14-has-been-released/5404">The announcement blog post</a> introduces:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whonix 14 contains extensive security and usability improvements, new features and bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebased Whonix on <strong>Debian stretch</strong> (Debian 9).</li>
<li>Whonix 14 is <strong>64-bit</strong> (amd64) only - 32-bit (i386) images will no longer be built and made available for download.</li>
<li>The new <strong>Anon Connection Wizard</strong> feature in Whonix simplifies connections to the Tor network via a Tor bridge and/or a proxy.</li>
<li>The Tor pluggable transport <strong>meek_lite</strong> is now supported, making it much easier to connect to the Tor network in heavily censored areas, like China.</li>
<li>
<strong>Onioncircuits</strong> are installed by default in Whonix.</li>
<li>Tails’ <strong>onion-grater</strong> program has been implemented to enable <strong>OnionShare, Ricochet and Zeronet</strong> compatibility with Whonix.</li>
<li>
<strong>Onion sources</strong> are now preferred for Whonix updates/upgrades for greater security.</li>
<li>Reduced the size of the default, binary Whonix images by approximately <strong>50 per cent</strong> using zerofree.</li>
<li>
<strong>Updated Tor</strong> to version 3.3.9 (stable) release to enable full v3 onion functionality for both hosting of onion services and access to v3 onion addresses in Tor Browser.</li>
<li>Created the <strong>grub-live package</strong> which can run Whonix as a <strong>live system</strong> on non-Qubes-Whonix platforms.</li>
<li>Corrected and hardened various <strong>AppArmor profiles</strong> to ensure the correct functioning of Tor Browser, obfsproxy and other applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix</a>: A High Security Method of Surfing the Internet</h2>
<p>Whonix is a desktop operating system designed for advanced security and privacy. Whonix mitigates the threat of common attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity is realized via fail-safe, automatic, and desktop-wide use of the Tor network. A heavily reconfigured Debian base is run inside multiple virtual machines, providing a substantial layer of protection from malware and IP address leaks. Commonly used applications are pre-installed and safely pre-configured for immediate use. The user is not jeopardized by installing additional applications or personalizing the desktop. Whonix is under active development and is the only operating system designed to be run inside a VM and paired with Tor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After more than two years of development, the Whonix Project is proud to announce the release of Whonix 14.</p>
<p>Whonix 14 is based on the Debian stretch (Debian 9) distribution which was released in June 2017. This means users have access to many new software packages in concert with existing packages, such as a modern branch of GNuPG, and more. [1][2][3]</p>
<p><strong>Major Changes and New Features</strong></p>
<p>Whonix 14 contains extensive security and usability improvements, new features and bug fixes. For a detailed description of these and other changes, please refer to the official release notes. [4]</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebased Whonix on <strong>Debian stretch</strong> (Debian 9).</li>
<li>Whonix 14 is <strong>64-bit</strong> (amd64) only - 32-bit (i386) images will no longer be built and made available for download. [5]</li>
<li>The new <strong>Anon Connection Wizard</strong> [6] feature in Whonix simplifies connections to the Tor network via a Tor bridge and/or a proxy.</li>
<li>The Tor pluggable transport <strong>meek_lite</strong> [7] is now supported, making it much easier to connect to the Tor network in heavily censored areas, like China. [8]</li>
<li>
<strong>Onioncircuits</strong> are installed by default in Whonix. [9]</li>
<li>Tails’ <strong>onion-grater</strong> program has been implemented to enable <strong>OnionShare, Ricochet and Zeronet</strong> compatibility with Whonix. [10]</li>
<li>
<strong>Onion sources</strong> are now preferred for Whonix updates/upgrades for greater security.</li>
<li>Reduced the size of the default, binary Whonix images by approximately <strong>50 per cent</strong> using zerofree. [11] [12]</li>
<li>
<strong>Updated Tor</strong> to version 3.3.9 (stable) release to enable full v3 onion functionality for both hosting of onion services and access to v3 onion addresses in Tor Browser.</li>
<li>Created the <strong>grub-live package</strong> [13] which can run Whonix as a <strong>live system</strong> on non-Qubes-Whonix platforms. [14]</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Other Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop shortcuts are no longer available in non-Qubes-Whonix. Please use the start menu instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OnionShare is not installed by default in Whonix 14 as it is not in the stretch repository. [15] It can still be manually installed by following the Whonix wiki instructions [16] or building it from source code. [17]</li>
<li>Enabling seccomp (Sandbox 1) in /usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf causes the Tor process to crash if a Tor version lower than 0.3.3 is used. [18] [19]</li>
</ul>
<p>While there may be other issues that exist in this declared stable release, every effort has been made to address major known problems.</p>
<p>Please report any other issues to us in the forums, after first searching for whether it is already known.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade to Whonix 14</strong></p>
<p>Current Whonix users (or those with 32-bit hardware) who would prefer to upgrade their existing Whonix 13 platform should follow the upgrade instructions below.</p>
<p><a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Upgrading_Whonix_13_to_Whonix_14</a></p>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p>Work on Whonix 15 is ongoing and interested users can refer to the roadmap to see where Whonix is heading. [20]</p>
<p>Developer priorities are currently focused on easing the transition to the next Debian release due in 2019 (“buster”; Debian 10) and squashing existing bugs, rather than implementing new features.</p>
<p>We need your help and there are various ways to contribute to Whonix - donating or investing your time will help the project immensely. Come and talk with us! [21]</p>
