&gt; One of the individuals maintaining Guccifer 2.0&#39;s social media presence forgot to use a virtual private network to access a US-based social media platform, thus leaving an Internet Protocol address located in Moscow in the service&#39;s logs. Working from that address, a source told the Daily Beast&#39;s Spencer Ackerman and Kevin Poulsen that analysts were able to dig deeper and associate Guccifer 2.0 with a single individual: &quot;a GRU officer working out of the agency’s headquarters on Grizodubovoy Street in Moscow,&quot;

Rly? We don&#39;t really encourage global intelligence agencies trying to subvert user freedoms to use Whonix but doing so might have helped in this situation... Just sayin&#39;...

Apparently, the operation was handed off to a more senior GRU officer with better English skills (and worse infosec ability). +1 &quot;Privacy by default&quot;.</description>

<p>It’s definitely hard to be believe - but then you’re asking Whonix users who are here specifically to avoid such missteps.</p>

</aside>
<p>Every darknet market admin has made similar opsec mistakes even though their lives and freedoms also depended on maintaining anonymity. Wired’s version is a bit more nuanced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though it may feel surprising every time, elite hackers regularly make crucial opsec mistakes. North Korean hackers accidentally exposed their IP addresses during their attack on Sony Pictures in 2015. Investigators traced two of the founders of the dark web marketplace Silk Road simply because both men used their personal email addresses to establish accounts related to the project. And researchers at the Russian antivirus firm Kasperksy Labs exposed evidence in 2015 of an elite hacking group tied to the NSA, after the group accidentally let some IP addresses it owned expire, allowing Kaspersky to buy them and track malware that phoned home to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would think that professionals would have controls and policies in place to prevent such mistakes but then you look at leaks where guys like Harold Martin walk out the door with classified info from nearly every US intel agency… or where classified info is left on an unsecured AWS server… makes you wonder.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s possible the whole story is a fabrication. It’s also possible that IDF compromised a GRU machine and framed them. And also possible that somebody just fucked up. No way to know unless Mr. GRU turns up next in Siberia.</p>

</aside>
<p>I have read about this on HackerNews and I was surprised that so many “gurus” there are so clueless.</p>
<p>Whonix users are more security aware, does anybody from this community actually believe the bullshit that I quoted? Somebody on HN pointed out that people doing these kind of things at three letter agencies are unlikely to log directly, going around some middleman secure anonymous network (and this is the same principle that Whonix itself is built on), because such a mistake can cost them their career, in Russia it can cost them even more. But that NH poster was heavily downvoted.</p>

<p>As a pure, unsubstantiated guess, I would say the top 1% work together - unless it’s in their interest not to work together - but that’s kind of obvious. (ie I will kill you and take your money. Or I will dump my products and trash your stock. Or I will buy your debt and force you into default. Or I will support governments that support me and not you, etc, etc ad infinitum). Your understanding of the 1% seems a bit limited. Or you haven’t watched any Game of Thrones…</p>

<p>Can’t evaluate that statement. Evidence?</p>
