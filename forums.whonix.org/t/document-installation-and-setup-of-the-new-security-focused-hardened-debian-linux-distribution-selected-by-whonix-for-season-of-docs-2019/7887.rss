    <description>Hi everyone!

I&#39;m 0brand,

My project proposal &quot;_Document Installation and Setup of the New Security-focused Hardened Debian Linux Distribution&quot; [was selected by Whonix](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/) for the Season of Docs 2019. The following represents the basic outline of the work I intend to complete between September 2, 2019 - November 29, 2019 which is the Season of Docs documentation development phase. Any feedback (critiques, constructive criticism, ideas etc) would be appreciated.

**Project summary**


Project length:

Standard length (3 months)

**Project description**

Kicksecure is a new security-focused Linux distribution under active development by Whonix developers. This project documents the installation and setup of Kicksecure inside Windows/VirtualBox from the ground up, with a focus on educating first time Linux users with the skills they need to stand on their own two feet when using a Linux distribution.

Project Goals

1. Create Core Documentation

The beginning phase of this project will focus on the core documentation for Kicksecure. This will be comprised of an Comprehensive Project Overview, Tutorials to install and set up Kicksecure and post installation advice and tips.

2. Create Learning Areas for New Linux Users

Teaching new Linux users is not about writing a few man pages and calling it an educational area. Many beginners are unaccustomed to interacting with command prompts and troubleshooting their own problems. These pages will focus on Cli skills, practical problem solving and troubleshooting best practices.

3. Clearly Segregate Kicksecure from Whonix (Anonymity OS) Documentation:

While Whonix.org will be home to both Whonix and Kicksecure each OS has very different use cases which could lead to serious consequences if a user confused one for the other. For example, Whonix is well known for anonymity but a new user that is unfamiliar with Whonix might setup the Kicksecure and presume they were surfing the Web anonymously. To prevent these types of mistakes, Kicksecure documentation will be confined to an separate area of Whonix.org using a new book-like formatting style that is distinct from the Whonix OS documentation formatting style. Warnings will also be included in key areas such as the Kicksecure download page to prevent users from making these mistakes.

4. User Friendly Documentation

The installation and set up of a Linux distributions can be challenging even for experienced users. While an easy to use and intuitive UI can enhance the user experience, just as important is writing clear and easy to follow -- User Friendly -- documentation. Since the Kicksecure user base ranges from beginners to advanced Linux users, care must be taken the documentation is not written based solely on the technical expertise and understanding of the technical writer. Instead Kicksecure will be documented from the perspective of a Linux beginner that may have difficulty performing tasks experienced users find simple and easily completed.

5. Re-name Kicksecure OS

While this operating system is based on Kicksecure, a new name must be found to avoid trademark infringement violations. To achieve this goal the Whonix community will be encouraged to submit catchy names from which the Whonix developers can choose. Although, still in brainstorming mode, my top two choice are &quot;&quot;Sentient Linux&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;Sentinel Linux&quot;&quot;.

**Project Timeline**

The time-line for this project will be broken up into 7 mini-milestones which can be used to gauge progress and allow for adjustment to be made to ensure each section is completed on time. If difficulties arise at any point during Season of Docs, I will notify my mentor immediately so a plan of action can be formulated to solve the problem.

_Sep 02 ( Start Season of Docs Project)_

**Kicksecure Home Page**

The home page with provide an overview of Kicksecure detailing key points of the OS.

The initial documentation will consist of installation of Kicksecure in Windows/VirtualBox. This will limit the initial scope the this chapter. However, community members will be encouraged to test Kicksecure in Linux hosts as well as KVM hypervisor and document their finding.

Table Detailing Supported Host operating

Table detailing hardware requirements.

* Minimum requirements
* Recommended
* For best performance

Content will consist of an overview detailing the developmental goals and uses of Kicksecure followed by a table outlining the individual component.

Kicksecure Goals.

* Security focused Linux distribution
* Free and open-source
* User configurable
* Hardened by default

Table of the components that make up Kicksecure.

* VirtualBox hypervisor
* Windows
* Kicksecure based OS
* Terminology (host, virtual machine, guest OS etc.)

Kicksecure is configured with many advanced security features by default. This alleviates the need for users to fumble with often complicated configurations. All security enhancement will be detailed in a table with an brief explanation of benefits.

* Haveged installed by default for better entropy.
* Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization (sdwdate) is used rather than insure NTP.
* Deactivates previews in Dolphin, Nautilus.
* Deactivates TCP timestamps and Netfilter’s connection tracking helper.
* open-link-confirmation.
* Apparmor enabled by default with profiles.
* Security hardened Browser (Tor Browser without Tor)
* Improved Linux kernel
* Desktop environment; KDE (Available in Cli only).
* Other ...

_Milestone Sep 15 (Complete System Requirements, Features and Advantages, Designs and Goals )_

**FAQ**

FAQ page will be used for answering questions that are commonly asked by community members. Content will be added as needed throughout the duration of the project.

**Kicksecure Installation**

Download and installation of Kicksecure will consist of the following.

* Download table which houses the Kicksecure image, OpenGPG signature, sha512 hash and developers GPG singing key.
* Verify developers signing key and operating system image (tutorial).
* Download and verification of VirtualBox hypervisor (tutorial).
* Import Kicksecure in VirtualBox (tutorial)
* Start Kicksecure

_Milestone Sept 29 (Complete Download and Verify Debian Images, Debian Installation)_

**First Steps**

Users may be unfamiliar with the steps needed to customize the desktop environment and allocate system resources. Quick configuration&quot;&quot; tips will be documented for each of the following.

* Changing keyboard Layout
* Allocating additional system resources (RAM)
* Change screen resolution
* Desktop shortcuts
* Window style manager

**Bugs / Issues**

Bugs and issues found during testing of the OS and tutorials will be clearly documented along with workarounds and/or fixes. This page will also include issues that are common when running operating systems in hypervisors.

* Low RAM issues
* BIOS misconfiguration (Intel VT-d, AMD-V)
* Connectivity issues

_Milestone Oct 6 (Complete First steps, Kicksecure Bugs)_

**Learning Areas, Man Pages**

New users may be unfamiliar with Linux terminals/Cli. If the information they need is not easy to find or accessible they will end up opening a support request without even trying to find an solution. This section will document commonly used commands and practical command syntax. Each man will give a brief outline of the command, how to use it along with practical examples. It takes a while for users to remember the commands they have to use for different tasks. Through repetition users will remember command syntax over time.

* Terminal/CLI
* sudo
* Text editors
* Directory structure
* File system navigation
* File permissions
* Man pages
* Create files/directories
* Miscellaneous (ls, cat, less)

_Milestone Oct 22 (Complete Learning Area, man pages)_

**Practical Problem Solving**

Capable/experienced Linux users have good problem solving skills that they acquire over time. When a problem arises they automatically start searching for a solution, and keep searching until they find an answer or all possible resources have been exhausted. When a new Linux user encounters a problem they automatically open a support request. Its vital that good practices are reinforced from the very beginning.

Problem solving template : Users are more likely to be successful when troubleshooting if they follow step by step instructions. This will focus on how to gather relevant information and how to use that information to find a solution to their problem. This will be similar.

* Monitoring log files: Location of system logs (what each one is used for) and commands needed to narrow down the Cli output. (journalctl, dmesg etc…)

* systemd: status, starting and stopping services.

* Troubleshooting Common issues: Connection issues, broken software packages etc.

* Bug and/or issues reporting guidelines.

_Milestone Nov 05 (Complete Learning Area, Problem Solving)_

**Refactor Whonix Docs for Kicksecure / Kicksecure Quality Review**

The remainder of Summer of Docs will be focused on refactoring Whonix documentation for Kicksecure, and quality control.

Refactor Whonix Docs for use with Kicksecure

* Install Software Safely.
* Operating System Updates.
* Other... as time allows.

_Milestone Nov 25 ( Complete Season of Docs Project)_

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>With a heavy heart and due to personal reasons, I will not be able to complete this GSoD project in the required timeline. Patrick – both Lead Whonix developer and my GSoD mentor – and GSoD admins have been notified of my intention to  discontinue with Kicksecure documentation development at this time. However, I <strong>Will</strong> be completing Kicksecure documentation in the near future upon my return.</p>
<p>I would like to thank every contributor that has helped both myself and Kicksecure developers and I look forward to completing my project. Just not under the GSoD umbrella.</p>

<p>Sounds like that would be done by default. This isn’t a default. Actually quite difficult to encrypt a VM in-place.</p>

    When researching content for Kicksecure i noticed this snipet. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system</a> 

This is a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" rel="nofollow noopener">operating systems</a> specifically focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security" rel="nofollow noopener">security</a>. General-purpose operating systems may be secure in practice, without being specifically “security-focused”. 

Looking further down the page Whonix is the only OS listed as an General-purpose operating systems. This might lead peopele to believe Whonix is not secure?

            <p>Moving some content from <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure</a> to an Kicksecure/features-and-advantages page. Using sdwdate for Kicksecure time source isn’t really about mitigating time-skew attacks? More for something like rollback attacks?</p>
<p>EDIT: Answered my own question.</p>

<p>Yes. Good idea to start now. When answering forum questions as well. Its way to much work to start making changes all throughout <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix.org</a> until there are more regular contributors.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to either create a page with a more detailed table about the differences between Whonix and Kicksecure. Or maybe create a template we could add to different Whonix, Kicksecure pages. Both would a good idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>When looking for Kicksecure using a search engine most people will see Kicksecure is hosted on <a href="http://Whonix.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Whonix.org</a>.   Might cause a little confusion between the two projects. Wonder if it might be a good idea to add a link to Kicksecure/About on each Kickecure/<code>$somepage</code> for the time being?</p>
<p>I find the first paragraph a little confusing. Will have to rewrite that.  → <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure/About#Is_Kicksecure_an_Anonymity_Distribution_Like_Whonix.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">https://whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure/About#Is_Kicksecure_an_Anonymity_Distribution_Like_Whonix.3F</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Looking for ideas for the Kicksecure home page, not sure we should try to reinvent the wheel for the “JAZ”. Most project are using something like “Security Focused” or “Secure Browsing”. But for content lower on the page it might be a good idea to leverage whats been in the media over the last few years about breaches in major free email providers. (just some ideas)</p>
<ul>
<li>People can create unbreakable passwords for each account they have.</li>
<li>Possible to clean <s>malware</s> viruses from their system without expensive anti-virus software (VirtualBox snapshots, Qubes DispososableVMs etc)</li>
<li>Hardened to prevent compromise.</li>
<li>Maybe add a link to a page such as this?:  <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/most-secure-operating-system/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dailydot.com/debug/most-secure-operating-system/</a>
</li>

</aside>
<p>Wiki templates support variables. But if we have to define the variable form the page that references the template we gain nothing.</p>
<p>Maybe mediawiki supports conditional variables so it would react based on the page being hosted in the <code>Kicksecure/</code> hierarchy or something.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Template" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Help:Template</a></h3>

<p>
 A template is a Wikipedia page created to be included in other pages. Templates usually contain repetitive material that might need to show up on any number of articles or pages. They are commonly used for boilerplate messages, standard warnings or notices, infoboxes, navigational boxes, and similar purposes.
 The most common method of inclusion is called transclusion, where the wikitext of the target page contains a reference to the template, using the {{Template&nbsp;name}} syntax. Another method ...</p>

  </article>
  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>
  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>What do we do with pages such as</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Root" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Root</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SysRq" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SysRq</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Point_Release" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Point_Release</a></li>
<li>and many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such pages are not Whonix specific. At best “Kicksecure based” specific. Maybe <code>Kicksecure based</code> is a good concept to introduce to Whonix users?</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably not worth it to turn all Whonix wiki pages into wiki templates. A lot work for just changing the project name.</li>
<li>Probably not worth re-inventing all pages and re-adding to the <code>Kicksecure/</code> hierarchy.</li>
<li>So perhaps best to make such pages generic` Ii.e. unspecific to Whonix and valid for Kicksecure too. Perhaps avoiding saying either project name or if saying the project name list them both?</li>
</ul>
