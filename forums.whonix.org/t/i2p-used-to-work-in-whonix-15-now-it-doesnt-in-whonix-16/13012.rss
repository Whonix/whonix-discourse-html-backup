    <description>long time whonix user and supporter here hi :slight_smile: 

On whonix 15 i used a guide created by Desnake from Alphabay which went like this


    Run the following code:

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y;wget -q -O - https repo.i2pd.xyz/.help/add_repo | sudo bash -s -;sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install i2pd -y;sudo service i2pd start

    The above command installs secure package installation with HTTPS, gets signing keys and imports them, updates packages to recognize your newly added repository, install i2pd and then start the i2pd service.
    In Tor Browser or your Firefox, type about:config into the URL bar, accept the warnings and press Enter. Make the following changes:

    extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy true

    After setting extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy to true your browser might restart to apply changes. Apply the following changes where the first is the setting you have to search and after the space is the value you want to have:

     network.proxy.http 127.0.0.1

    network.proxy.http_port 4444

    IMPORTANT: Wait 2-5 minutes depending on your network in order for I2P to connect properly otherwise if you try instantly it might say that the host is unreachable.
    You are now able to browse i2p websites. On Tor Browser/Firefox it is important to add http:// infront of the i2p site otherwise you will search it instead with duckduckgo or other search engine which you have set.

For other Linux flavours find the most recent I2Pd documentation. i2pd is an established alternative i2p software which is the same as the original software however it is written in C/C++ and provides faster connection, less resource-hungry on the CPU/RAM etc. After installing i2pd either from source or from repository, you can proceed to the step where you modify Firefox/Tor Browser. 



Now i can&#39;t get it work on whonix 16 it installs correctly and when i visit say http zzz.i2p or http stats.i2p it loads them alright but when i visit other sites or alphabays url tnaefzkcnhryeusi7hdpqujqiqmnbtah3dmjcg3gvezohunjuxbq.b32.i2p it fails for some reason? I tried restarting installing reinstalling new template new connection nothing works! The same url on whonix 15 with everything installed i checked right now works perfectly? I used curl to get more information with the -o parameter and got curl: (6) Could not resolve host:   If I try on the browser it says   Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site.  but the site is up i can see it on whonix 15

To confirm it&#39;s an issue with whonix i started my Tails usb and used the custom script by desnake to enable i2p on there. It worked perfectly and the eepsite was displayed while it was unreachable in whonix 16!

I&#39;d like some help with this please!

An annoying thing i&#39;d like to add is tor browser constantly puts https:// infront of i2p links can we add something to recognise it as .b32.i2p and not put https? Really annoying when browsing forums like zzz.i2p</description>

            <p>Just tested two things. When there’s no internet sites like <a href="http://zzz.i2p/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://zzz.i2p/</a> automatically redirect to https. But when there’s internet, it will go back to not redirecting and accepting a connection to <a href="http://zzz.i2p" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://zzz.i2p</a>.</p>
<p>However these site darknetnow.i2p/, isitup.i2p, in.i2p no matter what I do redirects to https. So as far as my limited knowledge can tell this site either requires https and I messed something up in setting up in i2pd or tor browser preventing it from establishing a secure https connection. Or there is a cache that I don’t know about in i2pd, tor browser or whonix workstation. Or those sites are actually down and there is some auto redirect setting still active in tor browser that I haven’t figure out how to disable <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Okay these last three settings did it.</p>
<p>Actually I misread, and at first only entered<br>
network.proxy.http&gt;127.0.0.1<br>
network.proxy.http_port&gt;4444</p>
<p>Which didn’t work only at first!</p>
<p>Then reread and saw extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy&gt;true. After entering that it worked. So definitely need all those three settings.</p>
<p>However there seems to be still something strange going on with https.</p>
<p>If it takes a site too long to load, it seems to try to redirect to https. Then I can never get to the site again as it always tries to goto https.</p>
<p>I found this site: <a href="http://reg.i2p/alive/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://reg.i2p/alive/</a></p>
<p>Which seems to be a directory. And I’m just clicking whatever is stated at being alive. Now disclaimer I don’t know what these sites are so just clicking randomly to test. So forgive me if there’s something offensive there.</p>
<p>Thus far I’m able to get to some sites. But for some reason cannot currently see:</p>
<p>in.i2p<br>
<a href="http://isitup.i2p/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://isitup.i2p/</a><br>
darknetnow.i2p<br>
aaaaaaaalivetalkzzzzzzzz09allarxmetarootsznzarxpostmetasymbol.i2p</p>
<p>Only listing them to figure out why I can visit some sites and not others in case others can visit them. Is it maybe these sites actually have https installed? Or maybe at the time of writing these sites are actually done. I don’t know.</p>
<p>But I can’t figure out why when I add <a href="http://isitup.i2p" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://isitup.i2p</a>, it always changes to https then the site won’t load.</p>
<p>Currently https everywhere plugin is disabled.</p>
<p>And I’m usually the following recommended settings all listed above.</p>
<p>I tried looking in to if tor browser has a cache, it seems to be limited to the session only. So I cleared everything and restarted the browser. Still redirects to https.</p>
<p>Other than I’m glad to get some functionality out of the system and now I can learn more about i2p on whonix! Thank you for the assistance thus far! You guy have been a real help <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>By the way this experience is very nostalgic. Because of the decentralised aspect you’re searching for lists of links. Some sites are already down. You feel surprised when you get an up to date list link.</p>
<p>And most of these sites seem to be purely html. It’s like using the internet again for the first time in the 90s when there were no search engines. Very old school. Very cool <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Your connection to the i2p network appears to be ok. In TorBrowser about:config, ensure you’ve changed these values as well:<br>
extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy–&gt;true<br>
network.proxy.http–&gt;127.0.0.1<br>
network.proxy.http_port–&gt;4444</p>
<p>Now, try visiting a stable i2p site such as <a href="http://stats.i2p" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://stats.i2p</a> or <a href="http://zzz.i2p" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://zzz.i2p</a>. If you can see those, then TorBrowser is configured correctly to access i2p.</p>
<p>With i2pd, there is no router config page at 127.0.0.1:7657. The flatpak gui app is in essence the router config.</p>

<p>Hello, I was originally trying the whonix guide which didn’t work. I was sent to this thread. Trying your method. I’ve got the i2pd gui installed. It says connected<br>
Routers: 275 Floodfills: 186 LeaseSets: 0<br>
Client Tunnels: 41 Transit Tunnels: 0</p>
<p>But when I try to goto router page in tor browser or any .i2p sites it just states “unabled to connect”.</p>
<p>Before in the whonix guide it mentions all these proxy settings, privoxy, proxifyer, I didn’t do that here. Just your tor browser settings and installed i2pd from flatpak. Is there more i should do this time around? I’m also using whonix workstation on qubes for this. Thank you kindly for your advice.</p>

            <p>long time whonix user and supporter here hi <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>On whonix 15 i used a guide created by Desnake from Alphabay which went like this</p>
<pre><code>Run the following code:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https -y;wget -q -O - https repo.i2pd.xyz/.help/add_repo | sudo bash -s -;sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get install i2pd -y;sudo service i2pd start

The above command installs secure package installation with HTTPS, gets signing keys and imports them, updates packages to recognize your newly added repository, install i2pd and then start the i2pd service.
In Tor Browser or your Firefox, type about:config into the URL bar, accept the warnings and press Enter. Make the following changes:

extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy true

After setting extensions.torbutton.use_nontor_proxy to true your browser might restart to apply changes. Apply the following changes where the first is the setting you have to search and after the space is the value you want to have:

 network.proxy.http 127.0.0.1

network.proxy.http_port 4444

IMPORTANT: Wait 2-5 minutes depending on your network in order for I2P to connect properly otherwise if you try instantly it might say that the host is unreachable.
You are now able to browse i2p websites. On Tor Browser/Firefox it is important to add http:// infront of the i2p site otherwise you will search it instead with duckduckgo or other search engine which you have set.
</code></pre>
<p>For other Linux flavours find the most recent I2Pd documentation. i2pd is an established alternative i2p software which is the same as the original software however it is written in C/C++ and provides faster connection, less resource-hungry on the CPU/RAM etc. After installing i2pd either from source or from repository, you can proceed to the step where you modify Firefox/Tor Browser.</p>
<p>Now i can’t get it work on whonix 16 it installs correctly and when i visit say http zzz.i2p or http stats.i2p it loads them alright but when i visit other sites or alphabays url tnaefzkcnhryeusi7hdpqujqiqmnbtah3dmjcg3gvezohunjuxbq.b32.i2p it fails for some reason? I tried restarting installing reinstalling new template new connection nothing works! The same url on whonix 15 with everything installed i checked right now works perfectly? I used curl to get more information with the -o parameter and got curl: (6) Could not resolve host:   If I try on the browser it says   Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site.  but the site is up i can see it on whonix 15</p>
<p>To confirm it’s an issue with whonix i started my Tails usb and used the custom script by desnake to enable i2p on there. It worked perfectly and the eepsite was displayed while it was unreachable in whonix 16!</p>
<p>I’d like some help with this please!</p>
<p>An annoying thing i’d like to add is tor browser constantly puts https:// infront of i2p links can we add something to recognise it as .b32.i2p and not put https? Really annoying when browsing forums like zzz.i2p</p>
