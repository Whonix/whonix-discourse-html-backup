&lt;blockquote&gt;Talked to Joanna at C1C3.

Qubes does not forward real randomness from /dev/random to VMs yet. They have no plans to add this feature yet.

Although Qubes installs haveged by default, it&#39;s not clear if that is random enough. Randomness is a very difficult topic. Difficult to get down the rabbit hole. It&#39;s better to bootstrap haveged with strong entropy and to have multiple sources of randomness.

In comparison, for KVM there is VirtIO RNG.

VirtIO RNG is a paravirtualized device that is exposed as a hardware RNG device to the guest.

And I don&#39;t think they implemented this because they were bored. I think in this case it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.

She said one could implement this using qrexec and that they would merge a patch implementing this.
