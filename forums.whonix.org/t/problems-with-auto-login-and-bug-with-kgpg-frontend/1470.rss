    <title>Problems with auto login and bug with KGPG frontend?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/problems-with-auto-login-and-bug-with-kgpg-frontend/1470</link>
    <description>Again thank you Ego I would be lost without your kind help and polite responses, you are truly an asset to this forum.  I have managed to get everything almost set up for a full switch to whonix except for 2 things.  I noticed that the workstation comes with its own PGP client I managed to import my keys to it, yet I can&#39;t seem to find out how to open the page to draft a message to encrypt??  Can someone tell this noob what I am missing or do I need to add something to make this fully functional??

Secondly, I have noticed on the youtube vids when people run whonix it asks for their pw, for some reason ever since I have installed the gateway and workstation it auto logs me in every time.  Is this normal??  I believe I have successfully changed the pw yet it has yet to ask me for it when I start the client.

Any help would be appreciated....

Thanks in advance.</description>

            <p>There is no “import key to default client”. kgpg is a graphical frontend to gnupg (gpg). It uses the same settings folder as gpg ~/.gnupg.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help Patrick, I will likely just import a more secure PGP client then, but since I have already imported the keys to the default client does anyone actually know how to open a page to type a message??  Seems silly that it would come with a PGP client with missing a draft page?  Has anyone used the default client successfully?  How do you open a new page?</p>

            <p>kgpg is installed by default. It’s not Whonix’s own client. You can use it the same way like on any linux distribution as per <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About#Based_on_Debian</a>. But you don’t have to use it. You can also use gpg command line [most reliable, bug free] or other tools.</p>
<p>On youtube are probably very old versions. KDE autologin is expected. (<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/kde-kdm-autologin">https://github.com/Whonix/kde-kdm-autologin</a>)</p>
