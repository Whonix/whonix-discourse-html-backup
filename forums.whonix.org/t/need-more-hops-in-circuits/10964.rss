    <title>Need more hops in circuits</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/need-more-hops-in-circuits/10964</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am using my personal private bridges to access tor network
I also configured tor browser to use them. And today I see this. I cannot attach the pic forum doesnt let me do that.
So tor browser shows the circuit as follows
This Browser
Bridge
Country1
Exit country 2

I assume whonix works same way and this is a problem. Looks like I am having 2 hops instead of 3 due to the use of bridge. But the bridge is also me basically its not anonymous.

How comes bridge is treated as node? Is there a way I can configure it to use 3 hops with a bridge? Or did I get it wrong and its still 3 hops beside bridge?
I also read this wtf
https://support.torproject.org/misc/misc-11/
Do I need to recompile tor to fix that? Is it the only way?</description>
