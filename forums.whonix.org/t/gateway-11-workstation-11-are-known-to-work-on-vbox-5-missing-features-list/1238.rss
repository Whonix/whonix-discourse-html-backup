    <title>Gateway 11 &amp; Workstation 11 ARE KNOWN TO WORK on VBox 5; Missing Features List</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/gateway-11-workstation-11-are-known-to-work-on-vbox-5-missing-features-list/1238</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve done a lot of testing of both the Gateway 11 and the Workstation 11 running under the brand new, and significantly improved, VBox 5.  I recommend all Whonix VBox users download VBox5 directly from:  https://www.virtualbox.org/ and install/compile it (depending on the instructions for your distro).  Note that VBox5 is almost certainly *not* available from your distro&#39;s repos - and with some distros, you could be in for a very long wait.   ::)

I have been using VBox and Whonix for years.  Both of our new Jessie-based Guest OSes work perfectly, but I have noticed some significant shortcomings,   So I&#39;d like to start a list here for Patrick of things to fix prior to the Workstation 11 being released as stable.  Feel free to add to this list with issues that &#39;bug&#39; you.   8)

1.  Devices are not mounting properly.  This includes a failure to mount the VBox Guest Additions CD, despite being attached to the Workstation from within VBox.

2.  The Whonix documentation re:  VirtualBox_Guest_Additions, available from:  https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions is a complete disaster.  First, 11 is not even covered, and the &#39;information&#39; available for 10 states Guest Additions are installed by default.  Are we to left to *assume* this remains true for 11?  If Guest Additions is installed, it is broken, or somehow incompatible, as it is not working properly.  This documentation section needs a serious review and clean-up.

3.  USB devices (versions 1, 2 or 3) are not mounting correctly, despite being enabled within VBox, and enabled within the running Workstation.  This is an issue which cannot be allowed to exist - as it very seriously cripples the usefulness, expandability, etc of the Workstation as a desirable place to actually conduct work.  This issue may be related to #1 above - and may also be tied to the larger proper Guest Additions support issue for the Workstation 11.

4.  Shared folders are working, but I hate using them.  Obviously, they are controlled as a root owned resource, and it&#39;s a complete waste of time, and a PITA, having to chmod everything following copy operations.  This is another reason #3 above must be fixed.

Those were the major items I&#39;ve seen so far on the Jessie based Workstation 11.  All else (and I have tested many services), including the rock-solid Gateway 11, seems to be working correctly, and as expected.

Again, please feel free to append items of concern to this list of issues we want to see fixed by the time Workstation 11 - Stable is released.  
[b]
Please do not post anything here which does not come directly from your experience using the Gateway 11 and the Workstation 11.  This thread is NOT for addressing Whonix 10 (or earlier) issues.[/b]</description>

            <p>Some more tests using VBox 5. Not looking all that bad. When you uninstall (“sudo apt-get purge virtualbox-*”) the Debian VBox guest additions packages first, installation of VBox 5 guest additions from CD works fine. (Still not recommended as long as <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync">https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync</a> does not support this or until manually fixed.)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync/blob/master/etc/init.d/virtualbox-guest-utils.anondist">https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync/blob/master/etc/init.d/virtualbox-guest-utils.anondist</a> will exit 0 and do nothing which is also quite okay.</p>
<p>vboxadd-service worked for me. After reboot! It’s still a sysvinit script, not systemd unit file.</p>
<p>Kernel header packages need to be installed, but that’s the default anyhow.</p>
<p>I guess installation of guest additions using VBox CD should always be discouraged. Those could change too dynamically (wrt vbox-disable-timesync).</p>

            <p>Just tested VBox 5 from <a href="http://virtualbox.org">virtualbox.org</a> repository with Whonix 11.0.0.3.0 on Debian jessie. Guest additions functional.

<p>Have you got USB to work using VBox 5 and Debian jessie guest yet?</p>
<p>As for guest additions from CD to work… First of all, uninstall them. Then uninstall the Debian guest additions package. OR. Start fresh. Uninstall the Debian guest additions package. Install guest additions from CD.</p>
<p>BUT. There is another complication. This is discouraged until the <a href="https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync">https://github.com/Whonix/vbox-disable-timesync</a> package has been made compatible with newer guest additions / systemd. Implementing this either manually or by shipping the missing file in the package is probably not hard using systemd drop-in .d files.</p>
<p>Without serious help from the community, VBox support is on shaky grounds for non-Debian stable host operating systems.</p>

            <p>Patrick,</p>
<p>I just wrote a long post explaining that Guest Additions is failing to start on the Workstation 11, and it may indeed be due to the incompatibility issues you mentioned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it appears you posted at about the same time I did.  Your post won, and mine appears lost in the digital wind.  I do not have the energy to re-produce it, atm.   &gt;:(</p>
<p>Let’s keep facts and terminology straight.  I am running VBox 5 on my amd64 Fed 22 Host.  Gateway 11 and Workstation 11 are both 32-bit Debian Guests running on my Host.  If I were running a Debian Host, I would absolutely agree with your comments (which still may, or not, end up being valid for my setup).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The other question I have, with your recommended Guest Additions approach Patrick, are USB devices being recognized, and mounted, inside your Workstation 11?  &lt;-- That is the only thing important to me wrt Guest Additions.  Again, if an OS cannot even manage USB devices properly, it is seriously crippled from my POV, and is not particularly useful for conducting serious work.</span></p>
<p>Here’s the super condensed version of the Guest Additions failure I currently see:</p>

            <p>VirtualBox is mostly tested with Debian. Jessie contains version 4.3.18. The guest additions that are installed by default also come from Debian. That’s why those are compatible.</p>
<p>Now, when you are installing VirtualBox version 5 from a third party repository such as the Debian repository, guest additions versions are incompatible. I think from a project maintenance perspective, the best to say to a Debian user would be, that’s unsupported. (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#What_do_you_mean_by_unsupported.3F">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#What_do_you_mean_by_unsupported.3F</a>) Stick with versions that come from Debian. Don’t mix.</p>
<p>For Windows users / VirtualBox version 5 users it’s more complicated. No stable [like Debian stable] version is maintained by their distribution. So they use the current one, which is VirtualBox version 5. They need those instructions if they want to use guest additions.</p>
<p>Anyhow. Before manually installing guest additions using CD, to avoid conflicts and issues, I recommend running the following command.</p>

Remains installed by default for Whonix 11 also.
dpkg -l | grep -i virtualbox
Maybe it's broken in VBox 5. I haven't tested yet. Not sure if I will fix it. Patches welcome.
Documentation contributions welcome.
<blockquote>3.  USB devices (versions 1, 2 or 3) are not mounting correctly, despite being enabled within VBox, and enabled within the running Workstation.  This is an issue which cannot be allowed to exist - as it very seriously cripples the usefulness, expandability, etc of the Workstation as a desirable place to actually conduct work.  This issue may be related to #1 above - and may also be tied to the larger proper Guest Additions support issue for the Workstation 11.</blockquote>
Yes, probably same issue as above:
https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Known_bugs#Mounting_.28CD.2FDVD.29_Devices
<p>Unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. As long as no one clever enough finding a solution to this issue.</p>
<blockquote>4.  Shared folders are working, but I hate using them.  Obviously, they are controlled as a root owned resource, and it's a complete waste of time, and a PITA, having to chmod everything following copy operations.  This is another reason #3 above must be fixed.</blockquote>
Maybe a bug. The usual mount options that are documented
("sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 shared /mnt/shared")
should mount it as user, so no chmod should be required.

            <p>I’ve done a lot of testing of both the Gateway 11 and the Workstation 11 running under the brand new, and significantly improved, VBox 5.  I recommend all Whonix VBox users download VBox5 directly from:  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a> and install/compile it (depending on the instructions for your distro).  Note that VBox5 is almost certainly <em>not</em> available from your distro’s repos - and with some distros, you could be in for a very long wait.   :<img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have been using VBox and Whonix for years.  Both of our new Jessie-based Guest OSes work perfectly, but I have noticed some significant shortcomings,   So I’d like to start a list here for Patrick of things to fix prior to the Workstation 11 being released as stable.  Feel free to add to this list with issues that ‘bug’ you.   8)</p>

<li>
<p>Devices are not mounting properly.  This includes a failure to mount the VBox Guest Additions CD, despite being attached to the Workstation from within VBox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Whonix documentation re:  VirtualBox_Guest_Additions, available from:  <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox_Guest_Additions</a> is a complete disaster.  First, 11 is not even covered, and the ‘information’ available for 10 states Guest Additions are installed by default.  Are we to left to <em>assume</em> this remains true for 11?  If Guest Additions is installed, it is broken, or somehow incompatible, as it is not working properly.  This documentation section needs a serious review and clean-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USB devices (versions 1, 2 or 3) are not mounting correctly, despite being enabled within VBox, and enabled within the running Workstation.  This is an issue which cannot be allowed to exist - as it very seriously cripples the usefulness, expandability, etc of the Workstation as a desirable place to actually conduct work.  This issue may be related to <span class="hashtag">#1</span> above - and may also be tied to the larger proper Guest Additions support issue for the Workstation 11.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared folders are working, but I hate using them.  Obviously, they are controlled as a root owned resource, and it’s a complete waste of time, and a PITA, having to chmod everything following copy operations.  This is another reason <span class="hashtag">#3</span> above must be fixed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those were the major items I’ve seen so far on the Jessie based Workstation 11.  All else (and I have tested many services), including the rock-solid Gateway 11, seems to be working correctly, and as expected.</p>
<p>Again, please feel free to append items of concern to this list of issues we want to see fixed by the time Workstation 11 - Stable is released.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Please do not post anything here which does not come directly from your experience using the Gateway 11 and the Workstation 11.  This thread is NOT for addressing Whonix 10 (or earlier) issues.</span></p>
