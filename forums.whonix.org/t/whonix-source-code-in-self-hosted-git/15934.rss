    <description>Hello, would love to see Whonix self hosting the git server.
I have problems with github, they block certain providers and certain IPs.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Thank you for contacting GitHub Support.
&gt; Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.
&gt; In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.
&gt; Our Terms of Service state that an individual may not maintain more than one:
&gt; https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements
&gt; We&#39;ll need to leave this account flagged.
&gt; Regards,

2 reasons they replied:
&gt; Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.

Mail provider censor.

&gt; In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.

I did not try to create multiple free accounts. 
Probably IP based flag considering many people use the same exit node.

I chose an e-mail provider that does not require personal information nor signup without tor and could be done without javascript enabled.
I could of course hop mail server till I find one that works, but that would solve the account problem, but not the bigger problem that is relying on github for everyone that wants to contribute and depending on giving enough information for 3rd party servers till they are satisfied.

I can of course try other git hosting solutions, but Whonix being hosted on a different server such as GitHub makes merge requests impossible, for someone to review the request, they would need to see a branch hosted on a different server and they would only be able to compare locally. Mail patches are also possible, but then that is a closed review process, with only one person seeing the patch before being applied, as there is not Whonix mailing list related to that.

Also, as discussions should happen here instead of git issues, the git server program does not need lots of features.

I hope this incite the git hosting to come sooner.</description>

<p>On the other hand, when there was phabricator, there’s always been lower activity there and then duplication in forums vs phabricator. So the ideal issue tracking which would imo be a forum with easily usable tags/components would be best but that doesn’t seem to exist.</p>

<p>A git patch can express multiple commits.</p>
<p>But, yeah… Only if a separate forum thread per patch. And then in the main discussion just link to it.</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the posting patches directly to the forums should probably stay the exceptional cases. If used a lot, might quickly trash the forums. And if patches are posted elsewhere (such as on paste websites) and only links to patches posted in forums that might be marginally better. But then paste websites expire. Then web archiving these would be required. Getting more and more messy.</p>

<p>no dependency on third-parties servers rules and logging</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>At time of writing, Whonix server - just as any other server for any other project - is also “hosted in the cloud” at a root server (or VPS server) provider. The server provider could also do logging without my consent and/or knowledge. Related:<br>
<a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust#Self-Hosting_vs_Third_Party_Hosting">Placing Trust in Whonix ™ chapter Self-Hosting vs Third Party Hosting in Whonix wiki</a><br>
So all of the perfection, a lot of the advantages of no logs for example by self-hosting discourse and not using the hosted version by discourse cloud might actually go out of the window due to the server provider at least in principle having the power to log.</p>
<p>That’s might be why why Qubes concluded it’s not worth to even try to optimize for self-hosting:</p>

    Another great point I wish I had in mind when writing above bullet points. Self-hosting doesn’t have good incentive structures. 

If all goes well, it’s invisible effort.
If it gets hacked, it’s probably resulting in FUD (related: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Trust#Server_Security">Placing Trust in Whonix ™ chapter Server Security in Whonix wiki</a>) and ridicule.
If using third-party hosting such as github and <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/computing/120981-github-hacked-millions-of-projects-at-risk-of-being-modified-or-deleted">github gets hacked</a>, then it’s just a third party that got hacked and the reputation of the project that was using github remains stainless.

<p>Time. I would be willing to take this on, but it would take away other work i could do to help whonix. I dont know how much this matters though if it works and helps the project at large become more productive. If I can speed up work for 5 people, but slow myself down this is probably fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Money. Cloud servers arent free (nor are physical servers).  I already pay $25 a month for our CI server and automated testing. I could ask Patrick for this money, but rather prefer to treat it as a donation for now. Once WATS is running I will collaborate getting a whonix owned server set up. But for now, this is an out of pocket expense. Regardless who pays it, a collaborator or the project itself, it still costs money.</p>

            <p>Hello, would love to see Whonix self hosting the git server.<br>
I have problems with github, they block certain providers and certain IPs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br>
Thank you for contacting GitHub Support.<br>
Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.<br>
In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.<br>
Our Terms of Service state that an individual may not maintain more than one:<br>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub Terms of Service - GitHub Docs</a><br>
We’ll need to leave this account flagged.<br>
Regards,</p>

<p>2 reasons they replied:</p>

<p>Mail provider censor.</p>

<p>I did not try to create multiple free accounts.<br>
Probably IP based flag considering many people use the same exit node.</p>
<p>I chose an e-mail provider that does not require personal information nor signup without tor and could be done without javascript enabled.<br>
I could of course hop mail server till I find one that works, but that would solve the account problem, but not the bigger problem that is relying on github for everyone that wants to contribute and depending on giving enough information for 3rd party servers till they are satisfied.</p>
<p>I can of course try other git hosting solutions, but Whonix being hosted on a different server such as GitHub makes merge requests impossible, for someone to review the request, they would need to see a branch hosted on a different server and they would only be able to compare locally. Mail patches are also possible, but then that is a closed review process, with only one person seeing the patch before being applied, as there is not Whonix mailing list related to that.</p>
<p>Also, as discussions should happen here instead of git issues, the git server program does not need lots of features.</p>
<p>I hope this incite the git hosting to come sooner.</p>
