    <description>Hello, would love to see Whonix self hosting the git server.
I have problems with github, they block certain providers and certain IPs.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Thank you for contacting GitHub Support.
&gt; Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.
&gt; In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.
&gt; Our Terms of Service state that an individual may not maintain more than one:
&gt; https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements
&gt; We&#39;ll need to leave this account flagged.
&gt; Regards,

Mail provider censor.

&gt; In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.

I did not try to create multiple free accounts. 
Probably IP based flag considering many people use the same exit node.

I chose an e-mail provider that does not require personal information nor signup without tor and could be done without javascript enabled.
I could of course hop mail server till I find one that works, but that would solve the account problem, but not the bigger problem that is relying on github for everyone that wants to contribute and depending on giving enough information for 3rd party servers till they are satisfied.

I can of course try other git hosting solutions, but Whonix being hosted on a different server such as GitHub makes merge requests impossible, for someone to review the request, they would need to see a branch hosted on a different server and they would only be able to compare locally. Mail patches are also possible, but then that is a closed review process, with only one person seeing the patch before being applied, as there is not Whonix mailing list related to that.

Also, as discussions should happen here instead of git issues, the git server program does not need lots of features.

I hope this incite the git hosting to come sooner.</description>
