    <title>Tunnel Whonix Gateway through VPN VM, howto?</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/tunnel-whonix-gateway-through-vpn-vm-howto/369</link>
    <description>Hey, I try to tunnel Whonix Gateway through ubuntu vm (vmware/virtualbox) with openvpn connection. So far i set the openvpn adapter 1 to NAT and adapter 2 to a specific internal network same which whonix gateway is connected to (adapter 1). 
What changes I have to take now to get the connection to work like in case of whonix gateway - whonix workstation, what changes you took there on the gateway?
Would be great if there&#39;s anyone with advise.

edit: I&#39;ve already tried out Pfsense but didnt worked for me - vpn provider related problem</description>

<p>Yes. However, that’s different from rootkits.</p>
<p>For just enforcing user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; destination you can archive the same by installing the VPN on the host and using VPN-Firewall (<a href="https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall">https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall</a>) or by using Whonix-Gateway’s VPN-Firewall feature (<a href="https://www.whonix.org/blog/testers-wanted-vpn-firewall">https://www.whonix.org/blog/testers-wanted-vpn-firewall</a>).</p>
<p>A stackable VPN-Gateway however could give you access to more advanced tunneling scenarios, such as multiple VPNs.</p>

            <p>Thank you guys, didn’t know that there are already such great tutorials for this.<br>
I’ve tried  to setup pfSense Vm once but didn’t worked for me - provider related problem I think, going through your tutorial now mirmir and hope that I’m able to get it to work this time.<br>
Like Patrick said  "Chaining Anonymizing Gateways -      <span class="bbcode-b">Experts only! </span>" I’m glad that you guys can help me out and provide great Tutorials for this because I’m not a expert and to be confronted with all that unfiltered stuff gives me headaches.</p>
<blockquote>It wouldn' t help against rootkits, at least I am not seeing how at the moment. Nevertheless having pluggable gateways that one can stack in arbitrary orders would be interesting. See also:</blockquote>
hm, I have little knowledge about that stuff but my idea was that the separation would prevent the vpn from getting circumvented like with tor and Whonix - on the  Workstation of course?! I feel it gets embarrassing now for me xD
<blockquote>My advice for this approach:
1) first, learn how to do without involving Whonix
2) after you figured out, combine this with Whonix
Don't try to start involving Whonix, then it's getting too complex.</blockquote>
<p>alright, I do my best! ;D</p>

            <p>Although it’s certainly possible to setup Linux VMs as VPN gateways, I recommend using pfSense router/firewall VMs. They’re smaller, and secure setup is much easier.

            <p>So you want to have something like a VPN-Gateway (or same with different term: Whonix-VPN-Gateway).</p>
<p>Good question. Unfortunately, also a big question. It’s like asking “how to make a Tor-only Gateway” or “how to make Whonix”.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, I'd like to (user -&gt; VPN -&gt; Tor), but instead  of run the  openvpn client on host or Whonix-Gateway, I was thinking about a extra VM as a Gateway for Whonix-Gateway, so I would be able to chain multiple VPN or could implement a second layer on Tor (user-&gt;Tor-&gt;VPN) with  more security e.g against rootkits and stuff on my Whonix-Workstation.</blockquote>
It wouldn' t help against rootkits, at least I am not seeing how at the moment. Nevertheless having pluggable gateways that one can stack in arbitrary orders would be interesting. See also:

<blockquote>I need to know now how it is possible to establish a internal network between two VM like you did with Wonix-Gateway  and the Workstation</blockquote>
My advice for this approach:
1) first, learn how to do without involving Whonix
2) after you figured out, combine this with Whonix
Don't try to start involving Whonix, then it's getting too complex.
<p>Virtual Machines support connections between internal networks. Documentation about virtualizers explains how to set this up. For /etc/network/interfaces examples, have a look at eth1 on Whonix-Gateway as well as Whonix-Workstation eth0. Then you should be able to ping each other. Next step would be make the supposed VPN-Gateway forward traffic for clients. Start with clearnet traffic. If that works, configure the VPN-Gateway to route all traffic through a VPN and use something like VPN-Firewall (<a href="https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall">https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe asking on wilderssecurity forum would maybe make mirimir answer and help getting a pfSense based VPN-Gateway up and running in conjunction with Whonix. I’ll also ask mirimir to have a look at this thread.</p>
