    <title>Don&#39;t see any of bridge IPs in arm page 2 (circuits)</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/dont-see-any-of-bridge-ips-in-arm-page-2-circuits/3752</link>
    <description>Hi All,

Living under oppressive regime, same story.

I am connecting Whonix through bridges following the instructions mentioned in [Bridges wiki](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Bridges) and also tried finding answer as discussed in [this thread](https://forums.whonix.org/t/how-can-i-check-if-tor-is-connected-through-a-bridge-in-arm/2794/2).

While confirming I am following instructions mentioned in both the links above, my problem is when I move to page 2 of arm, I do not see any of the IPs of obfs4 bridges added in _/etc/tor/torrc._ and ~/user/.arm/torrc (both files have same config)

Questions are:

1. Is this behavior normal/expected?

2. Is there any other way in Gateway (if not in workstation) other than ( corridor ) to see something we are used to in TBB like on every webpage is shows (your PC &gt; xyz bridge &gt; tor circuits &gt; target website). Although in one of the threads I read workstation is not supposed to see such details by design but this view was a real peace of mind so any similar option in Gateway will be really helpful.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>Bridges are probably not connecting. Please check your Tor logs. See:</p>

<p>Not with such a pretty gui interface. <code>arm</code> is best (sanely) available on the gateway rather than using Tor control protocol and using at the raw data.</p>
<p>Torbutton (in TBB) is a Tor Controller. By design, such Tor Controllers cannot help with leak testing.<br>
For more technical reasoning, this footnote applies one to one, please have a look.<br>
