    <title>OTR will connect but will NOT authenticate</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/otr-will-connect-but-will-not-authenticate/3742</link>
    <description>I installed freetalk. When typing &quot;freetalk&quot; into terminal it ask for my jabber ID and pass. With my 1st account, after about 30 seconds of entering the password I would get the &quot;hangup&quot; error. I tried entering an incorrect pass to see if I get I different outcome, but still got the hangup error. After fully restarting a couple times the only thing I could think of is to make a new jabber account. This time after entering my pass it stays at the &quot;Authenticating...&quot; screen forever. I am completely stumped, need some advice.

EDIT:
I ran apt-get list --installed and OTR or freetalk where not there. I installed freetalk again, no errors. Looked at the list again, says its not installed?</description>
