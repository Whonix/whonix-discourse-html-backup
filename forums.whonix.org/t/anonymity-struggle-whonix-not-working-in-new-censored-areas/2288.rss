    <description>in Arab Gulf atm , not just Tor connection blocked but even Tor project website is also closed. 

so if u want to open TBB= not working

if u want to open Tor project website = not working

now if we come to whonix and how does it react to this blockage (Tor blockage) here r whonixcheck:- 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/9f6d39e1715356ba1f7561198304e468174fead5.png&quot; width=&quot;689&quot; height=&quot;371&quot;&gt;

and this is arm:- 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/ba1e6c404a5ba95b86575deae34df255b0e55337.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;458&quot;&gt;


if u look at arm u gonna c [27 duplicate hidden] , this message will not going to stay at 27 , but it will keep on increasing by time (it reached about 120 then i closed it because its non-stop). 

now if someone want to add bridges by following this page:- 

https://www.whonix.org/wiki/bridges

he need to go to Tor project website in order to add bridges , but Tor project website is closed! . 

so how whonix going to provide bridges for their users ? 

also now Tor project is providing TBB through emails , how about whonix ? r we going to provide whonix through emails if any country blocked whonix website ? 

(i dunno yet , which bridges going to work if meek is not working)

-------------------

what TBB is saying when it tries to connect in these areas/countries:- 

TBB normal connection (no bridges):-

<p>It would be better not to be a participating Router , if your Router isn’t running 24/7 and this would require more RAM that it would not be acceptable for the normal user .<br>
If you care about the I2P Network its far better to install it on a dedicated machine running I2P or setup a hosted Server</p>

            <p>You don’t need port forwarding if its running on the UDP transport. You need to set your I2P router to run in hidden mode and as running behind an NAT firewall.</p>
<p>With basic blocking techniques you will be able to get thru. If they run DPI that looks for I2P protocol specifically you won’t be able to connect. I2P could get Tor’s pluggable transports at some point.</p>

<p>It only means, that you do not have a functional port forwarding that allows unsolicited incoming connections.</p>
<ul>
<li>When i2p is running in Whonix-Workstation there is probably no way to fix this. (Explained on the i2p wiki page.)</li>
<li>When running i2p on Whonix-Gateway or another VM is NATed. Therefore the first port forwarding would be required from the host to the VM.</li>
<li>And even creating a port forwarding from the router to the computer is for most users a huge challenge. (Sometimes impossible because unsupported by provides. [example: 3G shared IP that are NATed by default])</li>
<li>I wouldn’t worry about it unless you deeply care about supporting the i2p network. In that case learn how to get port forwarding working for i2p running on the host first. It’s more of a router and i2p rather than Whonix question…</li>

<p>Not totaly right , I2P needs to Reseed via some URL so if these get blocked ,it fails to connect and find new peers .<br>
I hope you know that the agencys are not blocking Tor  because of  the IS . States do this to control their citizen.<br>

<p>American agencies till now didnt focus to block I2P , because its not yet used in widely from IS.</p>
<p>(if u think UAE ppl blocking Tor connection = ofcourse not , they r stupid. but its a work of agencies mostly from USA but sure in cooperation with UK,France,Germany,India agencies).</p>
<hr>
<p>but i dont think there is anyway to block I2P connection because its P2P connection , am i right ? they can only block I2P clearnet website.</p>

<p>in Arab Gulf atm , not just Tor connection blocked but even Tor project website is also closed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Could you please try I2P there if its not Dangerous for you ?<br>
I would like to know if they block I2P Reseed URLs and or Homepage.<br>
Maybe if we get lucky with I2P we could figure some way to go from there if Tor is blocked</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how many hours to download whonix with Tor+Bridges ? 3-4 hours maybe more ?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Regarding that, I have to say that yes, downloading over a bridge takes its time and depends on a bit of luck in regards to having a fast route (sometimes I get 200 KB/sec, sometimes only 50 KB/sec according to Arm). However, we need to keep in mind that this, while taking some time, is a one time commitment and a necessary evil, as well as the fact that in many cases Tor isn’t impacting speed as bad as other aspects of the connection, like the providing server.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
