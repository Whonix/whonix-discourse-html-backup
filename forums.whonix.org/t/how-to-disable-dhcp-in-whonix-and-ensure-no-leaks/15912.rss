    <title>How to disable DHCP in Whonix and ensure no leaks</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/how-to-disable-dhcp-in-whonix-and-ensure-no-leaks/15912</link>
    <description>Hello, I need to disable DHCP in Whonix, I have static IP on my host but running htop on my host shows dnsmasq is being ran with a &quot;DHCP ip lease script&quot;, which has the path to a binary with name &quot;libvirtd_lease_script&quot;. dnsmasq config file has DHCP disabled so the one running the binary is actually libvirtd, I managed to stop it by simply renaming the binary to &quot;test&quot; and killing dnsmasq

Now the problem is I am not sure if DHCP is disabled in Gateway, and most importantly that there were no leaks by me fiddling around with dnsmasq, so my question is actually 2 separate questions:

1. How to absolutely make sure that there are no leaks from Whonix ? is there a list of standard tests used by you to ensure that there are no leaks?

2. How to disable DHCP and set static IP for Whonix</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>  <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/hulahoop">@HulaHoop</a> I would like to add that I am an activist and live in a country that is worse than North Korea, a big tool that I depend on to continue living is Whonix.</p>
<p>Reason why I need to disable DHCP is closely related to the activism I know it does not makes sense but I am not allowed to explain it here</p>
<p>And reason why I need to ensure there are no leaks is because my life literally depends on there being no leaks, this is not about going to prison but life or death situation so please any help related to the 2 questions above would be massive thank you</p>
