I was thinking of adding  instead of &quot;It is not required for home PCs that do not change locations.&quot; https://gyazo.com/90252aa5cabf94dac7a41b33aa5ea2d5 

I was thinking of saying &quot;It is not required for home PCs that do not change locations unless you suspect somebody on your local network is trying to log your mac address.&quot;</description>

            <p>Alrighty,thanks for the reply it just got me thinking since I read this <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Education#MAC_Address" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Education#MAC_Address</a></p>
<p>and learned from it that  “However, other computers on the local network can potentially log it”</p>
<p>I also read that “If users intend to use an untrusted, public network then MAC spoofing should be considered.” Guess they were refering to remote networks,or anything besides local network.</p>
<p>And yea i’ve been reading the wiki a lot lately.</p>

</aside>
<p>If someone is on your <em>home</em> network they would already know who you are.  Also if someone is conducting suspicious/malicious  activity on your <em>home</em> network you have bigger problems than someone obtaining your MAC address. Therefore I don’t really see much benefit in MAC address randomization of your home pc.</p>
<p>Its great to see someone taking interest in making the whonix wiki better!!<img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
