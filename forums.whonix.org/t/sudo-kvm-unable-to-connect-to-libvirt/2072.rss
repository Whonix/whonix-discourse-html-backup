    <title>SUDO &amp; KVM = Unable to connect to libvirt</title>
    <link>http://forums.whonix.org/t/sudo-kvm-unable-to-connect-to-libvirt/2072</link>
    <description>is the KVM always needs to have the password of the Super User in order to make it work ? 

each time i open the kvm it tells me to enter my password:- 

&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/default/original/1X/5f52e57690bea619740397c8fbd3ad07e4bf5b1b.png&quot; width=&quot;690&quot; height=&quot;399&quot;&gt;

and if u wait without entering ur password it will say:- 

&gt; Unable to connect to libvirt.

&gt;error from service: CheckAuthorization: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

and if u press on details button it will show u:- 

&gt;Unable to connect to libvirt.

&gt;error from service: CheckAuthorization: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

&gt;Libvirt URI is: qemu:///system

&gt; Traceback (most recent call last):
&gt;   File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtManager/connection.py&quot;, line 1020, in _open_thread
&gt;     self._backend.open(self._do_creds_password)
&gt;   File &quot;/usr/share/virt-manager/virtinst/connection.py&quot;, line 158, in open
&gt;     open_flags)
&gt;   File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/libvirt.py&quot;, line 105, in openAuth
&gt;     if ret is None:raise libvirtError(&#39;virConnectOpenAuth() failed&#39;)
&gt; libvirtError: error from service: CheckAuthorization: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

is normal ? how to overcome this question on each time i open the kvm ? 

Note:- i didnt add user to my SUDO/root list , which mean in order to become root  i should type SU then password then for e,g apt-get update or ..etc. i dunno if this has any relation witha the problem here. but i mention it because i didnt have this in the past.

also forgot to mention , that when i download/install the KVM alone i open it = it wasnt asking me for the root passowrd. but when i installed Whonix inside it = kept asking me that.</description>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>under Debian, you just add your username to the “libvirt” group. Was actually explained in our wiki, see: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#KVM_Setup_Instructions">https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#KVM_Setup_Instructions</a></p>
<p>Thought you didn’t use Debian since you asked.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
