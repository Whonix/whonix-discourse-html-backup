    <title>Windows 10 v1703, fresh install not working</title>

    <description>Hi, I just recently learned about Whonix and I&#39;ve wanted to start using it. However, as simple as the instructions seem there seems to be problem with it (possibly tied to new build 1703, I just saw another thread). 

I&#39;ve never had Whonix on this computer before, I downloaded the installer and verified it was correct by using gpg4win. I proceed to installation, it finishes then I double-click on the Whonix shortcut new on the desktop, window pops up, I hit &quot;Start Whonix&quot; and I get a popup saying &quot;VirtualBox Manager has stopped working&quot;. I thought it could have been installation error, I went ahead and tried to run through the installer again and I got a BSOD (never had one on this computer, fresh install of Windows a while back, never saw it in the entire lifetime), however the other thread I saw also experienced a BSOD at some point of installation/usage. I reboot&#39;d and re-installed again it succeeded however same issue as the first time, &quot;VirtualBox Manager has stopped working&quot;.</description>

            <p>Hello, as your post implies, the error code seems to be related to Dell (hardware) or maybe Windows, but not to Whonix, have you tried googling this error code?</p>

            <p>I do not believe this is true. I verified this by uninstalling Whonix then installing Virtualbox and running a Linux VM under, worked flawlessly.</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p>As explained within the other thread, this is sadly not an issue with our software, but rather a VBox specific issue caused by certain specifics in some Windows installations.</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
