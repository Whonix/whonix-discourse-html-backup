<blockquote>
<p>Qubes OS is a desktop operating system that follows the principle of security through compartmentalization. In spirit, it is closely related to Genode. In contrast Genode’s clean-slate approach of building a fine-grained multi-component system, Qubes employs Xen-based virtual machines as sandboxing mechanism. In version 3.0, Qubes introduced a Hypervisor Abstraction Layer, which decouples Qubes from the underlying virtualization platform. This exploration project pursues the goal of replacing Xen by Genode as virtualization layer for Qubes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Since Qubes and Genode both utilize a network of sandboxed virtual containers each running its own operating system, I’m toying with the idea of replacing Qubes OS with Sculpt OS (Genode’s flagship) as the host for the Whonix gateway and workstation. Has anyone tried this before? Is there a reason why it shouldn’t be done?</p>

          <title>HiddenVM KVM version</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ApexMan]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Unsupported Platforms</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi Developers,</p>
<p>I have been working on a project called HiddenVM https ://github.com/IncognitoIceman/HiddenVM which is forked from https ://github.com/aforensics/HiddenVM . I decided to fork the project to use KVM instead of VirtualBox because it is insecure and Oracle’s track record of fixing security patch is very bad. I am a huge fan of Whonix because of it’s unbreakable design. This version of HiddenVM uses Tails OS as the host similar to the original version. The whole project is stored persistently in a Hidden veracrypt volume successfully implementing the Hidden OS feature of veracrypt.  The project combines the benefits of Tails, Whonix and Veracrypt into one package providing an ultra secure ecosystem.</p>
<p>I am planning to bring the usage of Whonix to masses with the help of this project. This version of HiddenVM connects to the clearnet usage infrastructure of Tails OS. You can only connect to the clearnet version using qemu:///session I have verified this myself as an instance of libvirtd running as the clearnet user appears in system monitor when you run qemu:///session.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have very limited network options when we run libvirt in qemu:///session mode as only usermode networking is allowed. This becomes a problem because the Whonix-Gateway requires a NAT connection to connect to the internet. I tried to create and start a Whonix external NAT network with no success because I keep getting a permission denied error when running the second command.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u clearnet virsh -c qemu:///session net-define Whonix_external*.xml</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo -u clearnet virsh -c qemu:///session net-start Whonix-External</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>error creating bridge interface virbr1: Operation not permitted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried giving elevated permissions to the clearnet user using polkit etc but have been unsuccessful. I have been working on the project for 3 months now and have hit a roadblock with this problem. The only solution looks like I  have to manually edit the libvirt files but I figured I would get some help from the Whonix developers themselves first to solve this issue.</p>
<p>You don’t need to install my project to solve my issues. I just need a general hack on how to give elevated permissions temporarily to qemu:///session to create a network bridge but if you are interested in using the project you can install it on Tails OS. I test my project on a Virtual machine running Tails OS making it easier. The initial setup takes 4 minutes to install and successfully installs and launches virt-manager as qemu:///session user.</p>
<p>To install the proejct all you have to do is type ./AppRun in the terminal in the HiddenVM folder.</p>
<p>I would be very much grateful if you would be able to solve my problem as this idea is too good to be wasted on a permissions issue.</p>

            <p>I’m asking here since we don’t have a separate UTM forum here. I was able to compile Whonix for UTM, and it worked flawlessly. I’m trying to figure out how to make the Workstation use the network of the Gateway, as it’s supposed to be. What configuration is recommended to do in the network tab in UTM? Thank you.</p>

          <title>TOR not connecting when using Whonix GW 16 in vmware workstation</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ok so my nat adapter settings are fine and I can confirm the uplink works in a different machine.<br>
TOR is also not blocked since whonix 16 works fine in virtualbox.</p>
<p>However. When using Whonix 16 in vmware and setting the right static ip’s and disabling “EXIT_ON_UNSUPPORTED_VIRTUALIZER”<br>
Whonix Gateway still does not wan’t to connect to TOR for some reason.<br>
This worked fine with Whonix 15 and before so what changed?</p>
<p>I’m not sure what’s wrong here.</p>
<p>I noticed at least one other person having the same problem in the comment section of this youtube video<br>

There is a computer that doesn’t support VirtualBox at all!<br>
On virtualbox forums people say sometimes it happen but Oracle doesn’t care - it’s a free product.</p>
<p>Please make a special release for WMWare for windows. Very needed.<br>
A donation for this work can be done if needed.<br>

<p>I have a problem with connection in vmware workstation. I convert vm in virtualbox to use it in vmware. After that I cannot make a connection in vmware. All others vm in vmware working fine. Clock is fine. I check the firewall. Tor browser is working fine on host machine. I replace virtuabox guest addition with open vm tools. Nothing helps. Whonix everytime shows me “no route to host”. Anybody knows what should I change in vmware settings or adapter settings?</p>

          <category>Unsupported Platforms</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi i have problem with traffic  redirection from vmware machine to Whonix installed on virtualbox.<br>
What I done:<br>
-created 3rd NIC on whonix VM and configured as host-only network.<br>
-added 3rd NIC in Whonix firewall  configuration and restart it.<br>
-assigned IP 10.152.152.12 and mask 255.255.192.0 to mine 3rd NIC<br>
-created custom network  in vmware network editor as vmnet9  as bridge with Virtualbox-Host NIC.<br>
-setup NIC in Windows 7 as below:<br>
IP 10.152.152.12<br>
Mask 255.255.192.0<br>
Gate: 255.255.192.0<br>
1st DNS 10.152.152.10<br>
2nd DNS empty .<br>
I have still no internet connection on Windows 7.<br>
What do I do wrong/what else should I setup?<br>
Why do not I install it on a virtualbox?<br>
The answer is very simple. I need to emulate Android app which i can’t emulate with Android x86 but works on Bluestacks but the problem is that on Virtualbox I exprienced stability issues with bluestacks. I checked on Vmware and no problem what so ever so I decided to stay on vmware and redirect traffic to virtualbox’s vnet.</p>

            <p>Hi all, my first post in this forum. Thanks for all your hard work here!</p>
<p>I have got Whonix GW booting OK on a Raspberry Pi but my problem is that I have an ethernet and a wifi interface. The idea is to have ethernet running to my router, and a wifi interface acting as an AP for clients to connect to.</p>
<p>The config files all expect two ethernet ports, and that fact seems be hardcoded into a lot of the config scripts. I could maybe edit the scripts but I’m wondering if that’s enough or if I need to rebuild the kernel to be aware of the wifi interface?</p>
<p>Another related problem is that I can’t do much to install wifi drivers etc, because the DNS is not working (by design). But Tor is also not working because one of the interfaces is missing so I’m in catch-22 that I need drivers to get the networking up, and I need networking to install the drivers.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a couple of days fighting this and have run out of ideas.</p>
<p>One obvious idea I had was to somehow temporarily configure the gateway to run DNS over clear networking while I fix everything. I’ve seen a lot of interesting-looking flags in  <code>30_whonix-gateway_default.conf</code>  but I’m not sure if it’s even possible?</p>

          <title>Tor connection speed: VMware Whonix vs native Torbrowser (self.Whonix)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sclublr]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed for a while that the internet benchmark running Vmware Whonix is about 1/10th of the benchmark speed of a native Torbrowser on the same host. My Whonix instance gets about 1Mbps and Torbrowser easily gets 10+MBPS.</p>
<p>The server hardware is VERY fast (i9 4.5ghz 32gb) so I doubt this is a desktop power issue.</p>
<p>Why is Whonix’s Tor connection so much slower than Torbrowers on host? Is this normal or to be expected?</p>

            <p>I have whonix workstation and gateway installed using VMware. I followed all of the steps but I am not getting any sound from this operating system. I get sound from other vm’s that I have so it isn’t my host machine. The installation of whonix did not add a sound card in the vm settings so I added one manually. If you’re going to say to not use VMware and to use virtual box, I know. I plan to. But for now, how can I fix this? Unless VMware is my problem.</p>

          <title>Error Upgrading 8.2 to 9 &amp; Importing 9 into VMWare Workstation</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am having trouble both upgrading whonix workstation from 8.2 to 9 and importing the 9.0 ova.</p>
<p>Both issues may stem from the fact that I am using VMWare Workstation, so I understand if not much resources can be dedicated to troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>As far as the upgrading goes, the sanity checks have passed, and I can follow the wiki steps up to the upgrade step. After running ‘apt-get install whonix-workstation’ I cannot continue to ‘apt-get dist-upgrade’, when I attempt that step, no URLs resolve, and I seem to have lost all internet connectivity.</p>
<p>I’ve made a snapshot before I started the upgrade process, so I am able to roll back and try again, which results in the same thing happening.</p>
<p>Due to this, I’ve tried to import the 9.0 ovas so I may transfer files from the vmdks at a later date, when I try to import the ovas and retry to relax the specification, the following error occurs and I cannot import.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-username="&quot;Error Message&quot;">

            <p>hey guys, I have the gateway and workstation working great in virtualbox.  however, I have another VM that is running another linux distro, but it is in VMware.  Is there an easy way to bridge this vm into the virtualbox “internal network” ?  I have read the docs on setting up another GNU/Linux distro, but that is placing the distro inside of a virtualbox VM, not vmware.</p>
<p>I have tried a lot of different combinations, like binding on a 3rd network interface to the host-only port and then bridging in the vmware through that device, but I havent been able to get any internet connectivity…</p>
<p>Unrelated, I recently upgraded Whonix from 8 → 9, and (as per the upgrade docs), I keep having to run “sudo service msgcollector restart” in order for whonixcheck to work.  Is there anyway to get this automated at boot up?</p>
