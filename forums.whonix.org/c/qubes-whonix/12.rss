            <p><code>update-torbrowser</code> is broken in the whonix-ws-16 template as of tor browser 12.0.  This problem appears to be due to a Tor project change in URLs.  The latest files are now located in the following directories:</p>
<p><code>https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/12.0/</code><br>
<code>http://scpalcwstkydpa3y7dbpkjs2dtr7zvtvdbyj3dqwkucfrwyixcl5ptqd.onion/torbrowser/12.0/</code></p>

            <p>I keep running into the same error when trying to update the Whonix Work Station qube. In the updater window it says <strong>dpkg was interupted, you must manually run ‘dpkg --configure -a’ to correct the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>I tried running that in the terminal but nothing happens. Can someone give me a hand? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi, I harden my whonix-ws-16 with all the recommendations from Whonix documentation such as LKRG, Tirdad, Hardened Malloc, Hidepid, Apparmor, Security-Misc, SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener and I also disable the root account.</p>
<p><em>But I am wondering:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Does it affect the Tor Browser fingerprint?</li>
<li>If I install proprietary software will it be able to correlate between 2 different devices where both are hardened?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would be very grateful if you could help me figure this out</p>
<p>I am also experimenting with a similar one on Kicksecure, but I posted the question related to Kicksecure and Whonix in the Kicksecure forum as it makes more sense for it</p>

          <title>Is there any ways to check which IP is connecting to whonix gateway?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Im currently using Qubes OS, im trying to make my traffic through VPN, for that i’ve created everything to make the VPN work. And its working fine luckily. I’ve created sys-vpn and put it between sys-firewall and other-vm/sys-whonix. I’ve followed micah’s mullvad vpn guides and many more threats from qubes os forum to make it work. The VPN is perfectly working whenever im checking the ip and stuff. And when i disconnect it, the connection is literally cutting off as expected, same goes with normal browser as well as whonix/tor, connection is cutting off means VPN or the tunnel is working.</p>
<p>But im not 100% sure that the whonix traffic is coming through my VPN server instead of real IP, so the thing i just wanna check or know <strong>IS THERE ANY WAY TO CHECK WHAT’S THE IP ADDRESS WHONIX IS BEING CONNECTED TO AT FIRST?</strong> connecting to my real ip or vpn server ip.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

          <title>Sigh..another post about customizing Tor Browser in a Qubes-Whonix template</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dr_feelgood]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I for the life of me cannot get my security settings and changes to ‘about:config’ to persist after creating an I2P-Whonix workstation disposable template. I have read and re-read the Whonix documentation and the previous forum discussions on this topic. The exact point of failure is after I turn the AppVM into the disp template using the commands “qvm-prefs exampleappvmname template_for_dispvms True” and “qvm-features exampleappvmname appmenus-dispvm 1”.</p>
<p>The TLDR rundown of the steps I take are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone the whonix-ws-16 template</li>
<li>Install and configure I2P-Java according to docs</li>
<li>Close template and build an AppVM based on it <span class="bbcode-b">(without a NetVM attached)</span>
</li>
<li>Start Tor Browser in the freshly built AppVM and configure the settings I need</li>
<li>Close the AppVM and clone it, giving it some title with “dvm” tacked on</li>
<li>Run those 2 commands previously stated in Dom0</li>
<li>Start a disposable VM from the Applications Menu and manually add sys-whonix as the NetVM in the Qubes Manager</li>
</ul>
<p>During my troubleshooting of this issue, I have found that the customization I do to Tor Browser persists in the actual disposable VM template, but <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> in the dispvm’s that are made out of the template. And changes I make to another browser, like Firefox for example, do persist in each new dispvm, like intended.</p>
<p>I think I am narrowing down the issue being related to ‘~.tb’ not being generated until after Tor Browser is started, which is a problem when each dispvm is brand new and Tor Browser has not had the chance to start yet. My next guess in solving this issue is to customize the settings I need in the proper config files located somewhere in ‘/var’ in the original I2P-Whonix template, before I create the AppVMs based on it… Does that sound right? Some tips on how to properly edit those config files would be greatly appreciated, since I <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> the ‘~.tb’ directory is generated from the cache files in ‘/var’.</p>
<p>Am I on the right track or completely off base? Any and all help / feedback is welcome. I just want to start my I2P-Whonix dispvms without having to configure every setting every time in Tor Browser!!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been having issues connecting to tor. I am newish to qubes whonix and have seen other topics similar but they differed slightly and no troubleshooting has worked thus yet. First day of downloading qubes 4.1 was able to connect to tor for several hours, but since then have not been able connect. When using bridges, tor configuration gets stuck at 2% “Connected to pluggable transport” OR 10% “Connecting to relay”. When they get stuck here, there is no further movement. Seems like 1/10 times tor show connected without bridges, but whonix icon still shows the open lock and tor browser still does not connect.</p>
<p>sdwdate log viewer shows:</p>

<p>is local system time the same as sys-whonix UTC time? Must I adjust time in sys-whonix to match local time?</p>
<p>Now when running systemcheck in sys whonix gui:</p>
<p>systemcheck gave up waiting.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Connection 10 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=10 TAG=conn_done SUMMARY=“Connected to a relay” WARNING=“TLS_ERROR” REASON=TLS_ERROR COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore HOSTID=“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” HOSTADDR=“XX.XX.XXX.XX:XXX”</p>
<p>Though not advised I have manually adjust time in  forward and backwards 2 hours just to see if anything would change but no changes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to this helpful community if anyone is able to assist in troubleshooting. Learning qubes daily and the fact of this obstacle with tor puts a damper on it.</p>
<p>edit: am able to connect through debian 11/fedora 36 browser, just not through tor. since updates were configured over tor I cannot update to see if, because no tor connection.</p>

          <title>Disabling default sys-net traffic necessary when moving networks?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[movingnetworks]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am trying to understand the Fingerprint wiki. There is a recommendation to prevent non-Tor connections when moving between networks. I don’t understand what this achieves? I understand that any non-Tor connections that uniquely  identify somebody (such as visiting obscurewebsite dot com or facebook dot com) should be prevented, but the recommendation seems to mean that we should disable all clearnet traffic. I am a Qubes user so this would mean even default sys-net traffic. If you were to do this then an ISP adversary would not be able to tell what OS you are using but only creating Tor traffic is a fingerprint equally as identifiable as the fingerprint of the OS default clearnet traffic.</p>
<p>I think the best you can do when moving networks is remove your state file but your OS will always be visible.</p>
<p>The only other reason I can think of for this recommendation is to prevent the attack where an adversary is able to link Tor and non-Tor traffic but this isn’t something specific to moving networks.</p>
<p>I can not link but it is /wiki/Fingerprint</p>

            <p>Hi everyone.<br>
This article comes from QubesOS forum:<br>
<code>https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/icons-on-panel-just-show-a-qube-instead-of-its-applications-icon-minimal-template/11416</code><br>
(Sorry new for the forum, cannot include link on post.)</p>
<p>To conclude, I’ve followed the guide from kicksecure’s wiki, morphing debian-minimal template to kicksecure, and install lkrg, tirdad dkms modules, and enabling hardened-malloc.</p>
<p>I found that after enabling/installing hardened-malloc(both of default and light), the issue comes out as title says.</p>
<p>The whonix-gw template and its appvm also have the same situation so I am here to ask for help.</p>

            <p>grepping new status shows that anon-vm will target anon-gateway.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ cd /etc/qubes/policy.d

<p>But <code>qrexec-policy-graph</code> shows that a Workstation <code>anon-whonix-example</code> that has a separate Gateway <code>sys-whonix-example</code> uses <code>sys-whonix</code> for <code>whonix.NewStatus</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$ qrexec-policy-graph --source anon-whonix-example --target sys-whonix

<p>Is this something that should be added to the Multiple Gw intructions?</p>

          <title>Disable qrexec between Whonix and non-Whonix VMs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[kurdubirdo]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes-Whonix</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently made a stuff up and copy pasted from anon-whonix into a debian-11 VM. It got me thinking, why the hell is Qubes RPC even allowed between Whonix and non-Whonix VMs?</p>
<p>I added some initial rules to prevent the Filecopy case:<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm allow<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anyvm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm deny<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@anyvm</span> deny<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:whonix-updatevm allow<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@anyvm</span> <span class="mention">@tag</span>:whonix-updatevm deny</p>
<p>I am not certain this covers every case but it is a good enough start.</p>
<p>I then got to thinking, I don’t really want ANY Qubes RPC touching my whonix vms other than what is absolutely necessary. I guess this includes anything initiated by dom0 and the sdwdate GUI stuff. Coming up with the appropriate rules for this isn’t exactly straightforward without intricate knowledge of Qubes and Whonix. Is this something that has been looked into? If not, why not?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I create an AppVM with whonix-ws-16 as the TemplateVM then the AppVM has its default DispVM set to whonix-ws-16-dvm. If I then clone whonix-ws-16 and use the clone as the TemplateVM, the AppVM does not have its default DispVM set to whonix-ws-16-dvm.<br>
I don’t have time to play around with my system too much but in my case the default DispVM is being set to none (which happens to be my default global setting).</p>
<p>What concerns me most about this is that it implies cloning a TemplateVM is not creating a perfect replica. What else in the system could possibly be impacted by this I wonder?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In the last week or so I’ve been experiencing regular crashes of a qube based on whonix-ws template when I try to print. This is Qubes 4.1, whonix 16 fully updated. This qube has existed for some time with no significant printing issues. As i said, probably started in the last week.</p>
<p>Doesn’t happen every time i print. Sometimes first print job after booting, sometimes the 20th.</p>
<p>No noticeable pattern regarding size/type of file printing.</p>
<p>I have not tested extensively with another qube based on the same template.</p>
<p>Have hplip installed to handle printing.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any ideas or other information I could provide to help debug.</p>

          <title>Updating whonix packages manually in dom0?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[quuuubeswhooonix]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes-Whonix</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So Qubes 4.1.1 is released and some part of that update causes intermittent freezing/crashing of the entire system. This has been reported by many and there doesn’t appear to be any obvious fix.</p>
<p>My solution is to reinstall Qubes 4.1.0 and not update dom0, but the issue I now face is that my Whonix VMs auto restart as I can’t apply the dom0 update that prevents this.</p>
<p>I think I can get around this by updating only the necessary package in dom0 and hoping it doesn’t pull in any dependencies that cause the freezing to return (I assume it won’t). I would be doing something like this in dom0:</p>
<p>sudo dnf check-update<br>
sudo dnf upgrade qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix.noarch</p>
<p>My question is, am I potentially setting myself up for something malicious to occur? Obviously I’m bypassing the salt update but I assume that as soon as the issue is fixed in Qubes upstream I can just go back to normal update and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>The only alternative would be to manually modify the files that need changing but I would really prefer to avoid this.</p>

            <p>I accidentally ran /usr/bin/torbrowser in whonix-ws-16. Obviously it is not safe to run Tor Browser in the template but I am wondering if I have done any damage by executing this script. The script seems to check if it is a TemplateVM and exits if it is, but the script also does some other things before that and I am not proficient enough to ensure that everything it has done is safe.</p>
<p>Can somebody assure me that I don’t need to reinstall the template?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello to all.</p>
<p>I would like to use a <strong>wireless 13-15 inch touchscreen monitor</strong> connected either through bluetooth, wifi (or any other way I do not care as long as it works) to a Qubes-Whonix PC (mini-PC).</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:<br>
==&gt; 90% of the time this monitor is for having in bed, on couch and travel (train/car) therefore wireless would be ideal but I could consider having to use a very flexible cable if necessary…<br>
==&gt; Security-wise: I am no hacker, no dark net, no journalist/whistleblower so no need to have the strongest level of security. I however discovered I had a sick eavesdropper on my computer for god knows how many months/years and also would like to be sure my “anonimity” remains strong on streaming websites for example !</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible with Qubes-Whonix ?</li>
<li>if yes is there any (complex) configuration needed ?</li>
<li>what should I look for when looking at wireless touchscreens specifications in order to make sure the monitor will work with Qubes-Whonix ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I install Whonix on the Windows 10 laptop as well?</p>
<p>Please feel free to tell me if this a dumb idea! I’m just trying to learn through experimentation.</p>
<p>For my type of use, largely education and research at this point, I’m not worried about an advanced adversary. But maybe a medium advance adversary?</p>
<p>I’m still learning. Thank you for your help and patience.</p>

          <title>Best practice for using Tor Browser with Whonix Workstation</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. I am trying to carefully follow the instructions in the documentation and I am confused about how to run Tor browser. It says:</p>
<p><em>Tor Browser</em> is useful to run in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Whonix-Workstation ™ App Qube</code> (<code>anon-whonix</code>)</li>
<li>Dispoables</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tor Browser</em> should not be run in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Whonix-Workstation ™ Template</code> (<code>whonix-ws-16</code>)</li>
<li>Disposable Template (<code>whonix-ws-16-dvm</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>“create new qube” window only allows me to create an AppVM qube if I select a template. However, the instructions clearly say do not use a template and I only see Whonix Workstation available inside the “template” drop down.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
