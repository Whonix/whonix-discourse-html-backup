            <p>Been having issues connecting to tor. I am newish to qubes whonix and have seen other topics similar but they differed slightly and no troubleshooting has worked thus yet. First day of downloading qubes 4.1 was able to connect to tor for several hours, but since then have not been able connect. When using bridges, tor configuration gets stuck at 2% “Connected to pluggable transport” OR 10% “Connecting to relay”. When they get stuck here, there is no further movement. Seems like 1/10 times tor show connected without bridges, but whonix icon still shows the open lock and tor browser still does not connect.</p>
<p>sdwdate log viewer shows:</p>

<p>is local system time the same as sys-whonix UTC time? Must I adjust time in sys-whonix to match local time?</p>
<p>Now when running systemcheck in sys whonix gui:</p>
<p>systemcheck gave up waiting.<br>
Tor Circuit: not established<br>
Connection 10 % done. Tor reports: WARN BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=10 TAG=conn_done SUMMARY=“Connected to a relay” WARNING=“TLS_ERROR” REASON=TLS_ERROR COUNT=1 RECOMMENDATION=ignore HOSTID=“XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX” HOSTADDR=“XX.XX.XXX.XX:XXX”</p>
<p>Though not advised I have manually adjust time in  forward and backwards 2 hours just to see if anything would change but no changes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to this helpful community if anyone is able to assist in troubleshooting. Learning qubes daily and the fact of this obstacle with tor puts a damper on it.</p>
<p>edit: am able to connect through debian 11/fedora 36 browser, just not through tor. since updates were configured over tor I cannot update to see if, because no tor connection.</p>

          <title>Disabling default sys-net traffic necessary when moving networks?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am trying to understand the Fingerprint wiki. There is a recommendation to prevent non-Tor connections when moving between networks. I don’t understand what this achieves? I understand that any non-Tor connections that uniquely  identify somebody (such as visiting obscurewebsite dot com or facebook dot com) should be prevented, but the recommendation seems to mean that we should disable all clearnet traffic. I am a Qubes user so this would mean even default sys-net traffic. If you were to do this then an ISP adversary would not be able to tell what OS you are using but only creating Tor traffic is a fingerprint equally as identifiable as the fingerprint of the OS default clearnet traffic.</p>
<p>I think the best you can do when moving networks is remove your state file but your OS will always be visible.</p>
<p>The only other reason I can think of for this recommendation is to prevent the attack where an adversary is able to link Tor and non-Tor traffic but this isn’t something specific to moving networks.</p>
<p>I can not link but it is /wiki/Fingerprint</p>

            <p>Hi everyone.<br>
This article comes from QubesOS forum:<br>
<code>https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/icons-on-panel-just-show-a-qube-instead-of-its-applications-icon-minimal-template/11416</code><br>
(Sorry new for the forum, cannot include link on post.)</p>
<p>To conclude, I’ve followed the guide from kicksecure’s wiki, morphing debian-minimal template to kicksecure, and install lkrg, tirdad dkms modules, and enabling hardened-malloc.</p>
<p>I found that after enabling/installing hardened-malloc(both of default and light), the issue comes out as title says.</p>
<p>The whonix-gw template and its appvm also have the same situation so I am here to ask for help.</p>

          <title>Disable qrexec between Whonix and non-Whonix VMs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[kurdubirdo]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes-Whonix</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently made a stuff up and copy pasted from anon-whonix into a debian-11 VM. It got me thinking, why the hell is Qubes RPC even allowed between Whonix and non-Whonix VMs?</p>
<p>I added some initial rules to prevent the Filecopy case:<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm allow<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anyvm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm deny<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@anyvm</span> deny<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@tag</span>:anon-vm <span class="mention">@tag</span>:whonix-updatevm allow<br>
qubes.Filecopy * <span class="mention">@anyvm</span> <span class="mention">@tag</span>:whonix-updatevm deny</p>
<p>I am not certain this covers every case but it is a good enough start.</p>
<p>I then got to thinking, I don’t really want ANY Qubes RPC touching my whonix vms other than what is absolutely necessary. I guess this includes anything initiated by dom0 and the sdwdate GUI stuff. Coming up with the appropriate rules for this isn’t exactly straightforward without intricate knowledge of Qubes and Whonix. Is this something that has been looked into? If not, why not?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I create an AppVM with whonix-ws-16 as the TemplateVM then the AppVM has its default DispVM set to whonix-ws-16-dvm. If I then clone whonix-ws-16 and use the clone as the TemplateVM, the AppVM does not have its default DispVM set to whonix-ws-16-dvm.<br>
I don’t have time to play around with my system too much but in my case the default DispVM is being set to none (which happens to be my default global setting).</p>
<p>What concerns me most about this is that it implies cloning a TemplateVM is not creating a perfect replica. What else in the system could possibly be impacted by this I wonder?</p>

            <p>In the last week or so I’ve been experiencing regular crashes of a qube based on whonix-ws template when I try to print. This is Qubes 4.1, whonix 16 fully updated. This qube has existed for some time with no significant printing issues. As i said, probably started in the last week.</p>
<p>Doesn’t happen every time i print. Sometimes first print job after booting, sometimes the 20th.</p>
<p>No noticeable pattern regarding size/type of file printing.</p>
<p>I have not tested extensively with another qube based on the same template.</p>
<p>Have hplip installed to handle printing.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any ideas or other information I could provide to help debug.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So Qubes 4.1.1 is released and some part of that update causes intermittent freezing/crashing of the entire system. This has been reported by many and there doesn’t appear to be any obvious fix.</p>
<p>My solution is to reinstall Qubes 4.1.0 and not update dom0, but the issue I now face is that my Whonix VMs auto restart as I can’t apply the dom0 update that prevents this.</p>
<p>I think I can get around this by updating only the necessary package in dom0 and hoping it doesn’t pull in any dependencies that cause the freezing to return (I assume it won’t). I would be doing something like this in dom0:</p>
<p>sudo dnf check-update<br>
sudo dnf upgrade qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix.noarch</p>
<p>My question is, am I potentially setting myself up for something malicious to occur? Obviously I’m bypassing the salt update but I assume that as soon as the issue is fixed in Qubes upstream I can just go back to normal update and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>The only alternative would be to manually modify the files that need changing but I would really prefer to avoid this.</p>

            <p>I accidentally ran /usr/bin/torbrowser in whonix-ws-16. Obviously it is not safe to run Tor Browser in the template but I am wondering if I have done any damage by executing this script. The script seems to check if it is a TemplateVM and exits if it is, but the script also does some other things before that and I am not proficient enough to ensure that everything it has done is safe.</p>
<p>Can somebody assure me that I don’t need to reinstall the template?</p>

            <p>I noticed this after noticing that after suspend the Tor client was no longer working, and I narrowed it down to the clock being skewed.</p>
<p>This only started happening recently, the last 2 weeks I guess.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello to all.</p>
<p>I would like to use a <strong>wireless 13-15 inch touchscreen monitor</strong> connected either through bluetooth, wifi (or any other way I do not care as long as it works) to a Qubes-Whonix PC (mini-PC).</p>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:<br>
==&gt; 90% of the time this monitor is for having in bed, on couch and travel (train/car) therefore wireless would be ideal but I could consider having to use a very flexible cable if necessary…<br>
==&gt; Security-wise: I am no hacker, no dark net, no journalist/whistleblower so no need to have the strongest level of security. I however discovered I had a sick eavesdropper on my computer for god knows how many months/years and also would like to be sure my “anonimity” remains strong on streaming websites for example !</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible with Qubes-Whonix ?</li>
<li>if yes is there any (complex) configuration needed ?</li>
<li>what should I look for when looking at wireless touchscreens specifications in order to make sure the monitor will work with Qubes-Whonix ?</li>
</ul>

            <p>I have a laptop with Windows 10 installed and NordVPN installed.</p>
<p>I have another laptop with only Qubes-Whonix installed and MullvadVPN.</p>
<p>Does it make any sense to setup the Windows 10 NordVPN laptop as a wifi hotspot, then use it as my network connection for Qubes-Whonix laptop with Mullvad VPN running? Then use Tor Browser?</p>
<p>I know I can make it all function but its hard for me to understand what I’d actually be doing.</p>
<p>Tor Browser-&gt;VPN-&gt;VPN?</p>
<p>Should I install Whonix on the Windows 10 laptop as well?</p>
<p>Please feel free to tell me if this a dumb idea! I’m just trying to learn through experimentation.</p>
<p>For my type of use, largely education and research at this point, I’m not worried about an advanced adversary. But maybe a medium advance adversary?</p>
<p>I’m still learning. Thank you for your help and patience.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. I am trying to install Anbox. I am following the instructions from the Whonix dot org wiki page:</p>
<p><code>Anbox - Run Android Applications and Games</code></p>
<p>I tried to post a link but I do not have permission.</p>
<p>I get this error when I attempt Android Image step 4:</p>
<p>user@host:~$ sha256sum --check android_amd64.img.sha256sum<br>
android_amd64.img: OK<br>
user@host:~$ sudo mv android_amd64.img /var/lib/anbox/android.img<br>
mv: cannot move ‘android_amd64.img’ to ‘/var/lib/anbox/android.img’: No such file or directory</p>
<p>I am using a Qube with “tenplateVM” and template “whonix-ws-16”</p>
<p>I would be grateful for advice. Or, if there is a better Android emulator I would be interested to learn of it.</p>

          <title>Best practice for using Tor Browser with Whonix Workstation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[lqz8793]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes-Whonix</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. I am trying to carefully follow the instructions in the documentation and I am confused about how to run Tor browser. It says:</p>
<p><em>Tor Browser</em> is useful to run in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Whonix-Workstation ™ App Qube</code> (<code>anon-whonix</code>)</li>
<li>Dispoables</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tor Browser</em> should not be run in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Whonix-Workstation ™ Template</code> (<code>whonix-ws-16</code>)</li>
<li>Disposable Template (<code>whonix-ws-16-dvm</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>“create new qube” window only allows me to create an AppVM qube if I select a template. However, the instructions clearly say do not use a template and I only see Whonix Workstation available inside the “template” drop down.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Users,</p>
<p>I have recently updated to Qubes 4.1.1 and tested some things.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have a question.</p>
<p>Overall it runs very well, but I noticed one bug that has been discussed many times here and on the Qubes forum, namely starting sys-whonix when you have cloned this VM and want to update or install something, etc.</p>
<p>I repeated the test from back then by cloning a) sys-whonix, b) whonix-gw-16, c) whonix-ws-16 and d) anon-whonix and naming them differently. In addition, I based a whonix-16-dvm-2 on whonix-16-ws-2.</p>
<p>I connected the cloned Qubes in the same way as the originals, so that quasi a parallel independent system was created and should behave in the same way.</p>
<p>This also works.</p>
<p>But only if you</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>start the cloned Qubes from the app menu or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>activates the, say anon-whonix-2 from the Qube manager.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It does not work if you</p>
<p>starts the cloned Qubes (i.e. whonix-ws-16-2 and whonix-gw-16-2) from the Qube manager, for example to update them or to install or program something.</p>
<p>In this case the original, i.e. sys-whonix, always starts too!</p>
<p>I then went through all the known links and sources in the forums describing the problem and tried everything (including creating a 50_user.confi file with the known lines), but the problem persists.</p>
<p>I also tried (on Marmarek’s suggestion in the corresponding Github topic) to add a corresponding line with rules in the new policy guideline for Whonix, but it’s of no use.</p>
<p>Hence my questions:</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Or is the problem persistent and one of the big unsolved problems?</p>
<p>How does it behave with the Qubes updater? There is no way to check if the update of e.g. whonix-ws-16-2 is now done via sys-whonix-2 or via sys-whonix.</p>
<p>Or do I have to create a special kicksecure-16-Qube and then disable the autostart for sys-whonix? It is not clear from the instructions in which Qube to disable autostart (I assume for sys-whonix).</p>
<p>I raise this issue because I consider it a not insignificant security risk. Assuming sys-whonix would be compromised and the new clones are not yet, a user in the background would run the risk that when sys-whonix is activated, a temporal correlation analysis is possible (because both “sys-whonixes” are running in parallel), not to mention the possible updating of the clones via a compromised sys-whonix.</p>
<p>I thought of a way that might work to get around the problem if it can’t be solved any other way (yet), and if it’s just updating the clones.</p>
<p>You simply set the original sys-whonix to the cloned gateway (i.e. whonix-gw-16-2) for an update of the clones. Since sys-whonix turns on when you update anyway, you would then have the gateway from the cloned system.</p>
<p>This is not ideal, but a start. What do you think?</p>
<p>Thank you already for interesting information!</p>

            <p>Hello, I am still learning about Whonix and Kicksecure, I have read this documentation:<br>
/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Upgrading_Derivative_Deb_Packages_from_Source_Code#Get_the_Source_Code<br>
and decided to try the same on my cloned test Whonix-ws, in Qubes OS, but i got a huge amount of errors.<br>
Based on the page on the wiki, it looks like Qubes templates are not designed for this? If so, how can I help develop this in Qubes templates?</p>

            <p>First of all I would like to express my enthusiasm and gratitude for the Whonix project, it’s a unique and truly talented project especially needed nowadays to breathe freely.</p>
<p>I would like to know if I install “qubes-core-agent-networking qubes-core-agent-network-manager” in the Whonix Workstation template, can I use it as sys net, usb and firewall?<br>
If so, how safe would this be, as it would get the AppVm sys-net based Whonix-ws traffic clearnet, perhaps the template should be cloned?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
