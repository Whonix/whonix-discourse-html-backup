<a name="overview-1" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#overview-1"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>A few things have stood out to me that could be updated for simplifying collaboration between developers on the Whonix™ project. Namely, chat and git ops.</p>
<p>I have a few solutions that I would like to propose for these.</p>
<h3>
<a name="chat-2" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#chat-2"></a>Chat</h3>
<p>Currently, most conversation happens on Discourse. Discourse is an awesome tool, but I notice during my troubleshooting conversations that the thread about CI work is clogged with lots of back and forth debugging chat.</p>
<p>I have heard there is a telegram chat, but I do not use this service, and no longer have a smartphone connected to an SMS network.</p>
<p>Modern software devs often use tools like Slack, Mattermost, and Microsoft Teams to collaborate, but I think adding new tools is a bit much</p>
<h4>
<a name="proposed-solution-3" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#proposed-solution-3"></a>Proposed Solution:</h4>
<p>We could easily implement the new Discourse chat plugin for conversations between devs, and perhaps a bit of lighthearted convo too, in case contributors want to get to know each other and build community <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<a name="git-workflows-4" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#git-workflows-4"></a>Git Workflows</h3>
<p>Currently, we are using a few different Github repositories with various owners to make Whonix work. Phabricator seems to no longer be used, but Kanban boards would be awesome to help catalogue objectives and define milestones for the project.</p>
<p>I think having a centralized project board on repositories would be a great way to help organize things.</p>
<h4>
<a name="proposed-solution-5" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#proposed-solution-5"></a>Proposed Solution:</h4>
<p>Move all source code to a Gitea instance (I am happy to maintain and have a domain registered). We can use their issues feature to define and prioritize work, and create project boards with clearly defined acceptance criteria as well as <code>Good Starter Issue</code> tags for new contributors.</p>
<p>We can use scripts to migrate issues from Phabricator to Gitea, and have all the relevant repositories on under one organization which <a class="mention" href="http://forums.whonix.org/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> can be the admin.</p>
<h2>
<a name="final-thoughts-6" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#final-thoughts-6"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think Discourse is great, and that Discourse and Gitea could be the primary homes for Whonix moving forward. Discussion and work organization could be defined entirely in these two services, and could fill the void that services like Phabricator and Telegram were initially intended to address.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me speak my peace. Also, it should be mentioned that I am happy to implement all this work. The entire objective of my thoughts is to streamline development and community engagement, and not to overload devs that are already busy working on things.</p>

          <title>Red Team Lab Security Audit?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[torjunkie]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Organization</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Now that Whonix is a decade old and widely respected, stable, and has an increasing user-base, one major issue is outstanding - an official security audit.</p>
<p>In light of recent security audits undertaken by OTF of OnionShare and the like, it is worth reaching out to see if they would consider Whonix as a suitable audit candidate.</p>
<p>The Whonix platform explicitly fits the bill of their Red Team Lab goals:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/" class="inline-onebox">OTF | Red Team Lab</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Red Team Lab is one of several in-kind services offered by OTF. Through the Red Team Lab, OTF strives to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To strengthen the security of open-source internet freedom software by providing auditing services. The lab offers third-party services focused on improving the software security of projects that advance OTF’s internet freedom goals. Audits ensure that the code, data, and people behind the tools have what they need to create a safer experience for people experiencing repressive information controls online.</li>
<li>To engage in public safety audits. This allows the lab to audit and reverse-engineer potential malicious apps deployed by governments or state-sponsored actors, which may be putting users at risk through a grave privacy and security overreach.</li>
</ul>
<p>…</p>
<p>The lab will prioritize supporting the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet freedom efforts, tools, and software currently or previously supported by OTF</li>
<li>Efforts that fit within OTF’s remit, but for various reasons, may not be current or previous recipients of OTF funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects the Lab seeks to support</p>
<p>Some examples of applications the Red Team Lab will review are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Internet freedom project seeking a security audit of their software</li>
<li>An Internet freedom project looking for short-term support for remediation of known vulnerabilities</li>
<li>An internet freedom project looking for a security architecture and design review in the early stages of a project from a trusted and capable third party</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideal applicant is a software developer, project lead, systems administrator, or an information security technologist who can speak on behalf of a software project that has the ability to adequately respond to and maintain the lab’s output after the support is concluded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, Whonix would be a perfect candidate. Why not make contact?</p>

            <p>Hello. The Telegram bot <a href="https://missrose.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Rose </a>has a feature called notes. Whenever /notes is typed a list of user defined notes appear. A user can the call any notes with a hash tag. For example <span class="hashtag">#wiki</span>. That can appear the Whonix wiki link.<br>
Example from ParrotOS offtopic group:<br>
/notes<br>
List of notes in ParrotOS offtopic:</p>

This could save a lot of time since a user would not have to go back and forth to copy paste links. What do you think?</li>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It seems that the EU, similarly to the US,  wants to backdoor e2ee communications  supposedly to protect the children, but  as we all know that’s just a convenient excuse  to justify having access to images/videos and perhaps even text messages(depending on the chosen implementations). Given that several of the top proposals leaked to the Politico  would implemented on device/OS level,  and I believe whonix is based in Germany, I was wondering how the whonix project would respond to such legislation if it were to pass.</p>

<p>I’d like to put my hat in the ring and offer to maintain VMware images for the project. I can supply qualifications/references as appropriate if there is interest in developing for it.</p>
<p>I am not a coder but I have extensive experience as a sysadmin and systems architect, specifically with the VMware product line. I can run tests and update .ova’s. I will have limited ability to respond to forum posts but will do what I can there. Work/home life keeps me pretty busy but I’d like to do what I can for the project.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey all, we’re a team of CS students, considering Whonix for our senior capstone.</p>
<p>It’s required for us to reach out to the development team… and also I suppose I’m looking for maybe something a little more specific than the “Just get Started” directions.</p>
<p>We can help out on code or documentation. Experience in Python, C, Bash Scripting, and of course, competency in git.</p>
<p>Any recommendations for some of the easier (but possibly tedious) problems that need solving? We could help out on bug fixing, testing, or even adding a new feature. We’ve got a whole semester for this and our professor is expecting quite a bit of work.</p>
<p>Advice would be much appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>Looking further down the page Whonix is the only OS listed as an General-purpose operating systems. This might lead peopele to believe Whonix is not secure?</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0brand]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I’m 0brand,</p>
<p>My project proposal “_Document Installation and Setup of the New Security-focused Hardened Debian Linux Distribution” <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants/">was selected by Whonix</a> for the Season of Docs 2019. The following represents the basic outline of the work I intend to complete between September 2, 2019 - November 29, 2019 which is the Season of Docs documentation development phase. Any feedback (critiques, constructive criticism, ideas etc) would be appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Project summary</strong></p>
<p>Project length:</p>
<p>Standard length (3 months)</p>
<p><strong>Project description</strong></p>
<p>Kicksecure is a new security-focused Linux distribution under active development by Whonix developers. This project documents the installation and setup of Kicksecure inside Windows/VirtualBox from the ground up, with a focus on educating first time Linux users with the skills they need to stand on their own two feet when using a Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Project Goals</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Core Documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>The beginning phase of this project will focus on the core documentation for Kicksecure. This will be comprised of an Comprehensive Project Overview, Tutorials to install and set up Kicksecure and post installation advice and tips.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create Learning Areas for New Linux Users</li>
</ol>
<p>Teaching new Linux users is not about writing a few man pages and calling it an educational area. Many beginners are unaccustomed to interacting with command prompts and troubleshooting their own problems. These pages will focus on Cli skills, practical problem solving and troubleshooting best practices.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Clearly Segregate Kicksecure from Whonix (Anonymity OS) Documentation:</li>
</ol>
<p>While <a href="http://Whonix.org">Whonix.org</a> will be home to both Whonix and Kicksecure each OS has very different use cases which could lead to serious consequences if a user confused one for the other. For example, Whonix is well known for anonymity but a new user that is unfamiliar with Whonix might setup the Kicksecure and presume they were surfing the Web anonymously. To prevent these types of mistakes, Kicksecure documentation will be confined to an separate area of <a href="http://Whonix.org">Whonix.org</a> using a new book-like formatting style that is distinct from the Whonix OS documentation formatting style. Warnings will also be included in key areas such as the Kicksecure download page to prevent users from making these mistakes.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>User Friendly Documentation</li>
</ol>
<p>The installation and set up of a Linux distributions can be challenging even for experienced users. While an easy to use and intuitive UI can enhance the user experience, just as important is writing clear and easy to follow – User Friendly – documentation. Since the Kicksecure user base ranges from beginners to advanced Linux users, care must be taken the documentation is not written based solely on the technical expertise and understanding of the technical writer. Instead Kicksecure will be documented from the perspective of a Linux beginner that may have difficulty performing tasks experienced users find simple and easily completed.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Re-name Kicksecure OS</li>
</ol>
<p>While this operating system is based on Kicksecure, a new name must be found to avoid trademark infringement violations. To achieve this goal the Whonix community will be encouraged to submit catchy names from which the Whonix developers can choose. Although, still in brainstorming mode, my top two choice are ““Sentient Linux”” and ““Sentinel Linux””.</p>
<p><strong>Project Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The time-line for this project will be broken up into 7 mini-milestones which can be used to gauge progress and allow for adjustment to be made to ensure each section is completed on time. If difficulties arise at any point during Season of Docs, I will notify my mentor immediately so a plan of action can be formulated to solve the problem.</p>
<p><em>Sep 02 ( Start Season of Docs Project)</em></p>
<p><strong>Kicksecure Home Page</strong></p>
<p>The home page with provide an overview of Kicksecure detailing key points of the OS.</p>
<p>The initial documentation will consist of installation of Kicksecure in Windows/VirtualBox. This will limit the initial scope the this chapter. However, community members will be encouraged to test Kicksecure in Linux hosts as well as KVM hypervisor and document their finding.</p>
<p>Table Detailing Supported Host operating</p>
<p>Table detailing hardware requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum requirements</li>
<li>Recommended</li>
<li>For best performance</li>
</ul>
<p>Content will consist of an overview detailing the developmental goals and uses of Kicksecure followed by a table outlining the individual component.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Security focused Linux distribution</li>
<li>Free and open-source</li>
<li>User configurable</li>
<li>Hardened by default</li>
</ul>
<p>Table of the components that make up Kicksecure.</p>
<ul>
<li>VirtualBox hypervisor</li>
<li>Windows</li>
<li>Kicksecure based OS</li>
<li>Terminology (host, virtual machine, guest OS etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Kicksecure is configured with many advanced security features by default. This alleviates the need for users to fumble with often complicated configurations. All security enhancement will be detailed in a table with an brief explanation of benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Haveged installed by default for better entropy.</li>
<li>Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization (sdwdate) is used rather than insure NTP.</li>
<li>Deactivates previews in Dolphin, Nautilus.</li>
<li>Deactivates TCP timestamps and Netfilter’s connection tracking helper.</li>
<li>open-link-confirmation.</li>
<li>Apparmor enabled by default with profiles.</li>
<li>Security hardened Browser (Tor Browser without Tor)</li>
<li>Improved Linux kernel</li>
<li>Desktop environment; KDE (Available in Cli only).</li>
<li>Other …</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Sep 15 (Complete System Requirements, Features and Advantages, Designs and Goals )</em></p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p>FAQ page will be used for answering questions that are commonly asked by community members. Content will be added as needed throughout the duration of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Kicksecure Installation</strong></p>
<p>Download and installation of Kicksecure will consist of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download table which houses the Kicksecure image, OpenGPG signature, sha512 hash and developers GPG singing key.</li>
<li>Verify developers signing key and operating system image (tutorial).</li>
<li>Download and verification of VirtualBox hypervisor (tutorial).</li>
<li>Import Kicksecure in VirtualBox (tutorial)</li>
<li>Start Kicksecure</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Sept 29 (Complete Download and Verify Debian Images, Debian Installation)</em></p>
<p><strong>First Steps</strong></p>
<p>Users may be unfamiliar with the steps needed to customize the desktop environment and allocate system resources. Quick configuration"" tips will be documented for each of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing keyboard Layout</li>
<li>Allocating additional system resources (RAM)</li>
<li>Change screen resolution</li>
<li>Desktop shortcuts</li>
<li>Window style manager</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs / Issues</strong></p>
<p>Bugs and issues found during testing of the OS and tutorials will be clearly documented along with workarounds and/or fixes. This page will also include issues that are common when running operating systems in hypervisors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low RAM issues</li>
<li>BIOS misconfiguration (Intel VT-d, AMD-V)</li>
<li>Connectivity issues</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Oct 6 (Complete First steps, Kicksecure Bugs)</em></p>
<p><strong>Learning Areas, Man Pages</strong></p>
<p>New users may be unfamiliar with Linux terminals/Cli. If the information they need is not easy to find or accessible they will end up opening a support request without even trying to find an solution. This section will document commonly used commands and practical command syntax. Each man will give a brief outline of the command, how to use it along with practical examples. It takes a while for users to remember the commands they have to use for different tasks. Through repetition users will remember command syntax over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal/CLI</li>
<li>sudo</li>
<li>Text editors</li>
<li>Directory structure</li>
<li>File system navigation</li>
<li>File permissions</li>
<li>Man pages</li>
<li>Create files/directories</li>
<li>Miscellaneous (ls, cat, less)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Oct 22 (Complete Learning Area, man pages)</em></p>
<p><strong>Practical Problem Solving</strong></p>
<p>Capable/experienced Linux users have good problem solving skills that they acquire over time. When a problem arises they automatically start searching for a solution, and keep searching until they find an answer or all possible resources have been exhausted. When a new Linux user encounters a problem they automatically open a support request. Its vital that good practices are reinforced from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Problem solving template : Users are more likely to be successful when troubleshooting if they follow step by step instructions. This will focus on how to gather relevant information and how to use that information to find a solution to their problem. This will be similar.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monitoring log files: Location of system logs (what each one is used for) and commands needed to narrow down the Cli output. (journalctl, dmesg etc…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systemd: status, starting and stopping services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshooting Common issues: Connection issues, broken software packages etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bug and/or issues reporting guidelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Nov 05 (Complete Learning Area, Problem Solving)</em></p>
<p><strong>Refactor Whonix Docs for Kicksecure / Kicksecure Quality Review</strong></p>
<p>The remainder of Summer of Docs will be focused on refactoring Whonix documentation for Kicksecure, and quality control.</p>
<p>Refactor Whonix Docs for use with Kicksecure</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Software Safely.</li>
<li>Operating System Updates.</li>
<li>Other… as time allows.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Milestone Nov 25 ( Complete Season of Docs Project)</em></p>

            <p>I have a few questions for anyone who may have used Whonix as their first distro (or at least gravitated to it early on when learning the ropes with Linux):</p>
<ul>
<li>How long ago was this and/or what build did you start on?</li>
<li>What was the experience like?</li>
<li>Were there any particular resources that you found helpful (documentation/videos etc)?</li>
<li>What sort of resources do you think might have assisted you better?</li>
</ul>

          <title>Whonix join other FOSS projects on Cypher Market</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rehrar]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Organization</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Heyo, rehrar again. Just wanted to see if Whonix wanted to partner with my project <a href="https://cyphermarket.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Cypher Market</a> which is an online merch store for FOSS projects.</p>
<p>The profits of all merch go 45% to the FOSS project displayed on the merch, 45% to the designer (several designers are making merch for various projects), and 10% to Cypher Market. So far, we have various Monero projects, Veracrypt, and getting KeepassXC situated. We’re contacting other FOSS projects to join as well.</p>
<p>This was started as part of Monero’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/823p26/project_foss/" rel="nofollow noopener">Project FOSS</a> and became sort of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/97utum/a_little_project_of_mine_to_bring_fun_oss_merch/e4b31ca/" rel="nofollow noopener">continuation of the project</a>.</p>
<p>I would love to get some Whonix merch on there (we’re exploring more than just shirts. All designs can be run by the Whonix community for approval before we get them up there. What are the community’s thoughts about something like this. All Whonix profits will be paid to the XMR donation address of Whonix.</p>

          <title>Support policy for gazillion of crypto currencies?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This request brings up an interesting point.</p>
<p>Given there are 100s of cryptocurrencies, Whonix should probably make a point of only officially supporting the top players with specific documentation e.g. Bitcoin and other large players.</p>
<p>Then, when users continue to come to the forums in the future with a support request for the latest fanboiscoin (<span class="hashtag">#56</span>/542 available at that time), it can be stated that it is not officially supported i.e. the <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Free_Support_Principle">Free Support Principle</a> applies.</p>
