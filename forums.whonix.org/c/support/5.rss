          <title>VPN After Tor Instructions DOES NOT WORK</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I made a throwaway account just for this. I’ve spent hours on this crap, and it just simply doesn’t work. Torbrowser continues to bypass the VPN.</p>
<p>This is going to be an upset post. Take it for what you want, but when you throw a ridiculous long set of commands that even a sysadmin who writes their own shell scripts for fun, finds tedious … You’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Why can’t you just bundle this as a SCRIPT, that users can just run???  You could just ask them to create a separate template VM, and run the setup script in that.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what the most ridiculous part of this guide is? This little box EVERY TIME describing sudoedit. This guide is wayy too long already, and it’s going to waste screen space describing stupid sudoedit like 20 times. Show it ONCE at the top of the instructions.</p>
<p>But moreover, I modified /etc/uwt.d/50_user.conf . I installed dante, carefully copying every single command. I even dropped them into #!/bin/sh so that I couldn’t screw it up. It all ran with no errors.</p>
<p>This is a pristine brand new never touched VM so it should JustWork™. But it doesnt. So I tried the OLD method (well actually 3 of the 4) and of course that didn’t work because Mozilla controls Tor, and they constantly and intentionally break everything with new releases to make everything more complicated.</p>
<p>I need a VPN after Tor for a couple very specific use cases, and I can’t, because this is broken.</p>
<p><em><strong>I have done this before on another Qubes install and it wasn’t this hard</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember changing some onion-grater setting in a whonix gateway, which is notably absent in this so guide. A guide which has been nothing but a waste of hours of time now.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll just remove this post but please forward it to someone who can fix this. Nothing will make your users more upset than giving them hundreds of lines to read and follow, only for it to not work.</p>
<p>I mean ffs, in all the time it took someone to write that guide, they could’ve just written a script to implement it.</p>

          <title>2 Questions? There were 2 levels of support but how much &amp; VOIP</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BobTimToe]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>1)So there are 2 support options.  But it says pick an appropriate amount I believe.  so, I just select whatever option I want to pay?   Then that is $100 every 30 days, right?  That is the first question. Am I misunderstanding?  Is something not fully loading - how much do I pay.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>whonix — /wiki/VoIP Up until about 40 minutes ago, until I read that.  I thought myself and another person would somehow use whonix and skype to make fairly secure video calls.  I have personally been hacked twice over many years.   Paypal/Bank.  Both times money was returned and I was told to not ask more questions, just take the money be happy.  They did not allow me to ask if I did anything wrong or should do anything better.  Refunded, helped me.  Then told me keep using our stuff, bye…  Since them I use TOR.  It might be coincidental.  But I’ve had no more issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a bit of reading. It seems it will either be impossible to make video calls using a TOR/Whonix or rock the boat.  It feels like it might ‘violate’ terms of service or “expected use” policies.   If I use it for video it takes up too many resources.  I’d be happy to pay for premium support here and on tor(It does not exist there I know) but donate there…  However, I still think I would be told:  "It is not possible.  Or “we can’t really help you”.<br>
– Low Quality with occasional poor is not great but tolerable.  Upper Low/Medium<br>
– Short Duration and Frequency 1 60 minute call once a month</p>
<p>Am I correct in above statements?  Is there anything I can do, I tried to dig on my own for a little on my own.  also still curious about whonix support costs. I am sure I will need it for other things.</p>

          <title>Whonix-Workstation update problem - ERROR: Debian Package Update Check Result: Upgrade simulation failed!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Deneb007]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>When I use Whonix, I always start by doing a system check with the Systemcheck tool. This allows me to know if an update is necessary.<br>
I have never had a problem updating the Whonix-Gateway, but I am currently having a problem updating the Whonix-Workstation.<br>
Here is the error message displayed by Systemcheck:</p>
<p>ERROR: Debian Package Update Check Result: Upgrade simulation failed!</p>
<p>To fix, try running these commands:<br>
(Open a terminal, Start Menu → System → Terminal.)<br>
sudo dpkg --audit<br>
sudo dpkg --configure -a<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</p>
<p>Debugging information:<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate exit code: 100<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate output:<br>
Reading package lists…<br>
Building dependency tree…<br>
Reading state information…<br>
You might want to run ‘apt --fix-broken install’ to correct these.<br>
The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
linux-headers-5.10.0-19-amd64 : Depends: linux-headers-5.10.0-19-common (= 5.10.149-2) but 5.10.149-1 is installed<br>
Depends: linux-kbuild-5.10 (&gt;= 5.10.149-2) but 5.10.149-1 is installed<br>
E: Unmet dependencies. Try ‘apt --fix-broken install’ with no packages (or specify a solution).<br>
If you know what you are doing, feel free to disable this check. Create a file /etc/systemcheck.d/50_user.conf and add:<br>
systemcheck_skip_functions+=" check_operating_system "</p>
<p>(I get the same error message when I try to update the Workstation using the following command: sudo apt-get-update-plus dist-upgrade)</p>
<p>So could someone help me to fix this update problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

            <p>I’m confused after reading about the state file. I have a reason to regenerate it on the odd occasion so it would be good to know if I need to delete the whole state folder or just the state file. In the wiki “Tor Entry Guards” (I can’t add this link) it mentions them interchangeably. I guess it would depend on what the use case is but I think in some cases even if you change your entry guards then you might still be identifiable because of the other things you have cached. Say I go offline for a week then the amount of data I have to fetch when I come back online is a predictable amount as opposed to if I delete the whole state folder and refetch everything. Does this sound right or is it just the state file to worry about?</p>

            <p>I somehow managed to install onionshare 2.6 from source into  kicksecure morphed debian 11 computer. ( I know this is whonix, thats my test cpu.)  What you get is instructions and scripts.</p>
<p>Be security minded with downloads.  What you will need is python3,<br>
python3-pip. Next is poetry-python and add to PATH.  Next is tor-browser, but the script needs to updated to the latest version.  Then config or setup.</p>
<p>Will this install in whonix?  I have no idea.  Not versed enough in linux to say it will. Success in one thing does not translate into another.</p>
<p>Just saying thanks to the devs for this app.  Learning something new. <img src="//forums.whonix.org/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>

When I’m playing short videos on VLC or MPV inside whonix 16.0.8.2 for vbox, I notice videos will a lot of times either be high pitched or low pitched until I restart the VM (it can take several restarts before the pitch issue goes away). I’ve tried from 10gb of RAM to 2gb of ram allocated to the VM and 2-3 CPUs allocated, but it doesn’t seem to have an effect.</p>
<p>Also had this issue on older whonix versions as well.</p>

            <p>The icon in the upper left corner that drops down to show applications is now gone with most recent whonix update. I have seen this on two different workstation vm’s so it is not a error with an update. The only way i can even go to applications now is right click desktop and carefully open the submenus. If it werent for that feature i would be locked out of every program. Is there any way to get this back?</p>

          <title>Tor Browser Alt-Svc as a potential huge anonymity threat</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[whonixgod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. HTTP specification has a header called <strong>Alt-Svc</strong> which can automatically redirect user to another network location on a server side <strong>without !!!</strong> even asking a user.</p>
<p>(Cannot post a link here, you can Google for Alt-Svc Developer Mozilla Org documentation page)</p>
<p>I personally faced that problem when I visited some kind of web sites which used third-party domains like Cloudflare. When using Tor Broswer, Cloudflare automatically redirects all traffic from clearnet cloudflare dot com domain to its .onion one (cflareblahblahblah… .onion) without asking a user! When I checked my IP address on that site (yes, using a standard Tor Browser on a Whonix-Workstation), it shown me not the IP address of Tor exit node but Cloudflare CDN US IP !!!</p>
<p>So, to turn that hidden redirection off, I need to type <code>about:config</code> and set the value of the option to <code>false</code>:</p>
<p><code>network.http.altsvc.enabled</code> → <code>false</code></p>
<p>I recommend Whonix developers to turn off <strong>Alt-Svc</strong> header by default because I think it is a potential dangerous feature which is dangerous for anonymity. I am not sure if Tor Project developers turn this option off.</p>

            <p>When I set Tor Browser to Safest mode and go to websites that I know for a fact have https SSL certificates, very often (like 40% of the time) it will tell me that it’s HTTP only, so I hit proceed.</p>
<p>Then once the site loads, it has a lock and appears to be a legit cert.</p>
<p>Is this SSL stripping of malicious exit nodes?  Why is it saying no HTTPS?</p>

<p>I followed the instructions: on the wiki <code>https://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P#I2P_client_inside_Whonix-Workstation</code> successfully until step 4.</p>
<p>Using <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure i2p</code> worked. After that I tried using <code>sudoedit /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/clients.config.d/00-net.i2p.router.web.RouterConsoleRunner-clients.config</code> but it dropped the message “no such file or directory”. I checked the directory <code>/var/lib/i2p/</code> with <code>ls -a</code>  and it is empty.</p>
<p>Could you please support me in this case? Maybe I missed something. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am having issues running Docker containers inside my Whonix Workstation.<br>
These containers are not supposed to be external, and should really only work within the Whonix Workstation.</p>
<p>I get the error below when I try to run <code>docker compose up -d</code></p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I hope you are all well.</p>
<p>I am new to whonix. Well, I have been using it about a year but just with simple stuff. Tor sites and GPA P2P encryption keys. Nothing major.</p>
<p>How i can install support for I2P on my Virtual Box VM WHONIX Build Version [A]: 16.0.3.7 i am using?</p>
<p>Is there a new Virtual Box image i can download and use?</p>
<p>Again, i am a Noob. So inside of my Virtualbox it shows i have a Whonix gateway and then the Whoix workstation. I always boot the gateway first, then my workstation second, and everything works great with .onion (tor sites). No problems since i updated to this build…</p>
<p>Now, I just need to know how i can do the same for I2P sites using the same tor browser that comes with the Whonix workstation.?</p>
<p>I am using Whonix Build Version [A]: 16.0.3.7</p>
<p>Is there a new image or a guide i can follow to install I2P to work properly on Build Version [A]: 16.0.3.7?</p>
<p>I do not mind if i have to update to a newer image to get it working.</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be great!!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

            <p>I encrypted the disk using<br>
<code>cryptsetup reencrypt --encrypt /dev/sdXY</code><br>
my /etc/crypttab:<br>
<code>root_crypt UUID=ccfd2c14-0148-4679-9e2c-626e6e044d08 none luks</code><br>
my /etc/fstab:<br>
<code>/dev/mapper/root_crypt  /  ext4    defaults 0   1</code><br>
I also tried to change /etc/default/grub like this:<br>
<code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=ccfd2c14-0148-4679-9e2c-626e6e044d08:root_crypt  root=/dev/mapper/root_crypt  "</code><br>
After these files edited i used:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">update-grub
grub-install /dev/sda
update-initramfs -u -k all
</code></pre>
<p>initramfs does not mount luks partition automatically after booting.<br>
i should do it manually via<br>
<code>cryptsetup open /dev/sda1 cryptroot</code><br>
then it does not mount manually using<br>
<code>mount /dev/mapper/cryptroot /root</code><br>
but works for<br>
<code>/init</code><br>
and system starts successfully after double<br>
<code>exec switch_root /root /sbin/init</code><br>
do you have any advice? what am i doing wrong?</p>
<p>I am unable to attach screenshots or links, so these are console recognized listing:</p>

          <title>Stream Isolation Issue</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[streamisolation]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have been using whonix for a few years now, and I recently noticed this issue regarding Stream Isolation. I use a 1GB/s internet connection and TOR works consistently at speeds about 1MB/s. When I update 1 VM speed is 1MB/s, 2 VM speed is 500KB/s each, and 4VM speed is 250KB/s each.</p>
<p>Now the question, if Stream Isolation is active why they are sharing the same TOR channel? It is my understanding they should all use 4 different TOR channels at 1MB/s each, not the same at 250KB/s.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I hope somebody can help me.<br>
I once stumbled on the OnionPI script for the RPI… what it does is,i t creates a torified wifi acces point…</p>
<p>So from time to time i started adjusting the script to make it into a Tor-Physical-Isolation script.</p>
<p>Which can be found on github<br>
AnthonyDarkBlue/Tor-Physical-Isolation</p>
<p>Now, the problem is, the script works fine… but whenever i am on my workspace i cant seem to load tor…<br>
i can network perfectly fine over firefox, chrome, etc, etc. i just cant use tor browser (it doesnt even succeed connecting.</p>
<p>the script works fine on PC(A - gateway), no problems there, but on PC(B - workspace), the tor browsr doesnt load.</p>
<p>So can anybody help me out on how to configure tor browser on the workspace side? does whonix has a specific modification for this to be able to do or what is it what holds me back?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help and sorry if i am posting in the wrong section.<br>
friendly greetingz anthony.</p>
