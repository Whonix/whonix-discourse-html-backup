          <title>Stream Isolation Issue</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[streamisolation]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have been using whonix for a few years now, and I recently noticed this issue regarding Stream Isolation. I use a 1GB/s internet connection and TOR works consistently at speeds about 1MB/s. When I update 1 VM speed is 1MB/s, 2 VM speed is 500KB/s each, and 4VM speed is 250KB/s each.</p>
<p>Now the question, if Stream Isolation is active why they are sharing the same TOR channel? It is my understanding they should all use 4 different TOR channels at 1MB/s each, not the same at 250KB/s.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

          <title>Physical isolation question on tor browser config...</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I hope somebody can help me.<br>
I once stumbled on the OnionPI script for the RPI… what it does is,i t creates a torified wifi acces point…</p>
<p>So from time to time i started adjusting the script to make it into a Tor-Physical-Isolation script.</p>
<p>Which can be found on github<br>
AnthonyDarkBlue/Tor-Physical-Isolation</p>
<p>Now, the problem is, the script works fine… but whenever i am on my workspace i cant seem to load tor…<br>
i can network perfectly fine over firefox, chrome, etc, etc. i just cant use tor browser (it doesnt even succeed connecting.</p>
<p>the script works fine on PC(A - gateway), no problems there, but on PC(B - workspace), the tor browsr doesnt load.</p>
<p>So can anybody help me out on how to configure tor browser on the workspace side? does whonix has a specific modification for this to be able to do or what is it what holds me back?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help and sorry if i am posting in the wrong section.<br>
friendly greetingz anthony.</p>

  <p>Instructions on how to connect to Tor before a proxy (User → Tor → Proxy → Internet) using Proxy Settings Method</p>


  </article>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">
    
    
  </div>

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>Followed this with the intention of using a proxy addon (torbrowser → proxy → website), but it does not work, there is no connection to the internet when the proxy addon is enabled, so the instructions do not have any effect.</p>
<p>The instructions appear to be out of date because they reference this file “/etc/uwt.d/50_user.conf” and this file “/etc/torbrowser.d/50_user.conf” but neither file exists in whonix.</p>
<p>The titles for each section " Remove proxy settings for [Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix] and [Remove proxy settings for APT repository files] imply that this section is not about allowing tor → proxy, but about removing the software updates ability to update over tor, which isnt related to anything in this section of the website.</p>
<p>edit: I re-read the initial disclaimer about TB not having any known solution for that method, so i went to the next method <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy/Proxyfier_Method" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Connecting to Tor before a Proxy using Proxyfier Method - Whonix</a></p>
<p>which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is currently no tested, known to work solution for using Tor Browser with the Proxyfier Method. … Alternatively try the Proxy Settings Method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so theres no solution for first method, and no solution for the second method, but it suggests to try the first method, and then goes on (in the 2nd method) explaining how to configure TB with it. Thats very confusing.</p>

            <p>sometimes I happen to have to restart tor in the vm gateway, for safety I always shut down the vm workstation before doing it, but is it really necessary?<br>
Can I restart tor via the gateway tor control panel, without having to shut down the workstation first? Do I risk compromising my anonymity by doing so? Thank you</p>

I kept receive warnings like this while opening a link outside Tor Browser. I understand the risk but I need to do such action thousand of times every day. Is there anyway to disable such warning. I suggest to put a checkbox on the notification to allow user to disable the warning for 72 hours or permanently.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am a Korean user.<br>
I type Korean in ibus-hangul. (Most Koreans seem to use IBus.)<br>
However, when I updated Whonix, I could not type Korean in Tor browser.<br>
I happened to find that changing the name of the Tor browser folder to a name other than “tor-browser” resolves this problem.<br>
(Example) “tor-browser_1”<br>
This doesn’t happen in Debian.<br>
I wonder why this problem occurs.</p>

<p>In theory, could I host my own obfs4 bridge on a VPS with good specs just for a fast speed?  I’d be the only one on it right?</p>

          <title>Run Whonix on a Physical Box with KVM using Qemu</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[palacelead]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a physical box with WAN and LAN, some sort of arm64 device, running DietPi</p>
<p>I want to get Whonix onto the box.</p>
<p>Qubes is the best thing ever, after Whonix, but it’s got a lot of hardware demands. I’m also not sure to what extent Qubes protects against infected firmware (although it still may be better than non-Qubes). I do not always trust my hardware. In an emergency, it may not be easy to get a copy of Qubes on whatever hardware is available. (I know using whatever hardware is available has risks, but please do not use the fact that risks exist as an argument against trying to mitigate risks of certain threat models.) I want a small box where anything that goes through it goes through Tor. I know about TorBox but it is designed for a Raspberry Pi that has WiFi and I don’t want to project some WiFi signal out onto the world any time I run this. Even if TorBox does MAC cloning or changes the MAC any time it’s run, I don’t know what is going on during that critical boot time when there’s power and the software hasn’t started running. If a TorBox sends out a previous MAC address or it’s default MAC address when it’s starting prior to the software running, it provides a lot of information that could be picked up by mesh networks that send telemetry back to larger companies and sell it to data brokers. I’m aware of how hardware fingerprinting works and how Tor browser tries to reduce the attack surface and utility of that, but I do not care about that. I just want Whonix on a box.</p>
<p>I can get Buster on DietPi and install an interface and then just throw in Qemu and emulate KVM and try to route things around until it works. I could delete DietPi and just throw on pure Debian as another option. My box has a decent processor and RAM.</p>
<p>Are there any pitfalls I might run into? Am I approaching this problem the wrong way?</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I’m sort of new to Whonix as a daily driver.<br>
I’m trying to install my VPN software, which requires a private repo.<br>
I’m happy that my sources.list is now much safer,<br>
Is there a way to bypass apt-secure and a unsigned a repo when I choose to do so?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>E: Failed to fetch ocean.surfshark   .    com/debian/dists/stretch/InRelease  403  Forbidden [IP: 104.18.120    34 443]<br>
E: The repository ‘ocean.surfshark    com/debian stretch InRelease’ is not signed.<br>
N: Updating from such a repository can’t be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.<br>
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.</p>

          <title>Deanonymizing Monero</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello to the Whonix Community.<br>
Let’s discuss getting the best Monero’s anonimity.<br>
There are attack vectors against Monero’s anonymity. Monero has been attacked in the real world, and the U.S. Homeland Security gave a $3 million contract to a blockchain analysis company Ciphertrace for Monero tracking tools they made.</p>
<p><code>https://medium.com/@nbax/tracing-the-wannacry-2-0-monero-transactions-d8c1e5129dc1</code><br>
<code>https://coingeek.com/monero-is-traceable-using-new-ciphertrace-tool/</code></p>
<p>/r/Monero bans critics who show ways of tracing Monero transactions, and its users believe LEA tools to trace Monero are fake. Most responses in /r/Monero anonymity threads are “you can’t see addresses in online block explorer so it’s safe” and “it’s good enough”.</p>
<p><code>https://ryo-currency.medium.com/threats-to-ban-bad-news-acted-upon-by-monero-admins-5b49b9cbda1c</code></p>
<p>Monero developers acknowledge potentially deadly anonymity issues with their protocol in the Breaking Monero video series but deny their practical threat.</p>
<p>/r/Monero users say sending xmr between multiple wallets makes it more anonymous. But there are articles that doing it can hurt our anonymity. And Monero users don’t agree how much to do it.</p>
<p>For example a previous method of churning is now considered unsafe but /r/Monero doesn’t discuss it</p>
<p><code>https://monero.stackexchange.com/questions/4565/what-is-churning/4568#4568</code></p>
<p>There is a current attack against churning in the articles below.</p>
<p>Not the developers or the community give a guide how to churn and use Monero for best anonymity.</p>
<p>/r/Monero is like religious thinks the crypto is perfect.</p>
<p>These are more attacks but there are even more threads about Monero issues</p>
<p><code>https://ryo-currency.medium.com/on-chain-tracking-of-monero-and-other-cryptonotes-ed82ee2c0e66</code><br>
<code>https://ryo-currency.medium.com/how-buying-pot-with-monero-will-get-you-busted-knacc-attack-on-cryptonote-coins-a4a860c7bafc</code><br>
<code>https://ryo-currency.medium.com/tracing-cryptonote-ring-signatures-using-external-metadata-8b6c05c0c6f6</code></p>
<p>With these vulnerabilities how do we churn and use Monero for best anonymity?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>when ever I use Qubes-Whonix my home network becomes very unstable. All connected devices frequently drop out. I presume my router is crashing. Unfortuntely it’s an ISP provided router and debug capability is very limited.</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else? This has persisted multiple OS reinstalls and I keep Qubes-Whonix at default settings. I am out of ideas and would appreciate your assistance.</p>

          <title>Using Whonix gateway to route a LAN connection not through TOR</title>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I set up a Whonix gateway VM, which I want to use to let other VMs (non-Whonix) to communicate over TOR through it. In addition to that, I need my other VMs to be able to access 2 IPs on my LAN <strong>not</strong> through TOR. I wanted to do that through the Whonix Gateway also. I added the two IPs in 50_user.conf under whonix_firewall.d into the variable NON_TOR_GATEWAY. I additionally added them in the iptables both in OUT and FORWARD:</p>
<p><code>sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d &lt;MY_IP&gt; -j ACCPET sudo iptables -I FORWARD 1 -d &lt;MY_IP&gt; -j ACCPET</code><br>
Still, I was not able to contact those IPs, neither from the gateway itself nor from the other VMs going through the gateway.</p>
<p>Is there another setting that needs to be changed?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
