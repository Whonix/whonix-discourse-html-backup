            <p>I use Windows as a daily driver as I game a decent bit. If I  were to setup Proxmox and use a Linux VM on a Windows host, would that be more secure than just straight installing VMWare on Windows? Is there a better way to still use Windows while using something else to better preserve privacy? Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit: To add to this, would RDP be a viable option to reduce spying? Or ultimately is Windows a lost cause?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a setup where I have a separated VM with a connection to a TCP VPN. Setup is whonixVM-&gt;vpnVM-&gt;User</p>
<p>I am seeing two issues with this setup. One is VPN disconnects very often. Second is while ping is  stable around 200ms sometimes I start getting 2kms or even 4kms and then get back suddenly to 200ms.</p>
<p>My question is, if is there any configuration I can put on whonix gateway to keep VPN connections longer as the gateway is ONLY used to connect to the VPN servers. I read in the manual there is a section that talks about this but was not able to see any specific config for this case.</p>

          <title>How easy and effective is it for a coordinated government operation to track down a single Tor circuit?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[xxx]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The conditions are such that a person uses Tor to conceal his or her Internet activity from a hostile government. The Tor circuit created by the Tor client uses all of the three relays in a bunch of countries that cooperate with one another in identifying the Tor user. Do you think it is an effective and time-efficient strategy for all of these countries to help each other in identifying the Tor user by only tracking down the Tor circuit path while they possess the metadata information about the traffic flow? This includes timing, traffic size, source IP-destination IP records. Governments can access the data either directly from Tor nodes, or from the ISPs they connect to. The Tor user is not under active surveillance, which means the government doesn’t take bigger measures to surveil this particular Tor user other than those that already exist due to global passive surveillance.</p>
<p>For example, a police identifies the Tor exit node that the Tor user’s traffic passed through. Then they will find the middle node located in another country, the entry guard in yet another country and finally the IP address of the Tor user which they can correlate with his or her real identity thanks to ISP giving services to him or her.</p>

            <p>Hi guys.</p>
<p>I tried to install the i2p application in whonix the recent days, witout success. Everything was updated before. Whonix is running in a VirtualBox VM with XFCE. I am not sure, if my problem comes with the i2p installation. But at some point, my PC froze and I had to do a restart. Since then, when I start Whonix Workstation i just get this screen that says the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The default root account is locked (or should be locked). This is a security feature. See: </p>
<p>Ignore “host login:” below. Do not enter your current host computer username or password if this is a virutal machine.</p>
<p>Login Instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type the username. Default user name is “user” without quptes. Then press .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type the password. When entering the password, no password feedback (no asterisk ("*") symbol) will be shown. Default password is “changeme” without quotes. Then press .</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>When I enter my ID and passwort I just get some “info text” and get a command line “user@host:~$” . But I don’t know what to do next.</p>
<p>Maybe if someone tells me how, i can upload a screenshot. I can’t even copy the whole text, I had to type it manually here.</p>
<p>Is there a way to recover the system/XFCE or does any one have a idea, what to do? I am a very beginner with whonix and have no idea of all the commands.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help,<br>
Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi, I enabled kernel opts for my whonix-ws-16 to apparmor=1 security=apparmor, I was wondering if this has any effect on the tor browser footprint?<br>
And what does this setting do, i couldn’t find any description on the wiki page except that it enables Apparmor, although without this setting my tor browser wouldn’t let me go into home folders when saving some files, i understand these were Apparmor limitations? But how did they work if the kernel settings weren’t enabled?</p>

          <title>Is i2p still functioning on Whonix per the Official Guide?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[quberoadqube]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I have followed the instructions step by step to install i2p in my clone of whonix-ws-16 template per these instructions from whonix website /wiki/I2P. After installing I created an app qube based on this i2p template clone and the only files that I see in the appvm are router.config and router.config.anondist in /usr/share/i2p/.</p>
<p>Since I could not locate the rest of the installation in the appvm, I went to the ws-clone-i2p install and right clicked the whole i2p folder and moved to the appvm manually, just to test functionality and see if I could use i2p.</p>
<p>But here is the issue, after moving the file to my appVM and configuring tor browser with every step from the i2p link above, I get The proxy server is refusing connections. Just a few weeks ago I followed instructions that if I am correct, were also from whonix documentation but now I cannot find them. These instructions included  using “sudo systemctl stop i2p” and “sudo systemctl start i2p” as part of configuration but when I run this in the appVM terminal I get "Failed to start i2p.service: Unit i2p.service not found.<br>
". I also recall at one point using 127.0.0.1 address and not see plenty documentation for 127.0.0.2.</p>
<p>I have tried to execute startconsole.html from i2p/docs in the appVM and get</p>
<p>“The following file will be opened in janondisttorbrowser.desktop.<br>
Be careful if janondisttorbrowser.desktop is already running as your activities might get linked.<br>
/home/user/QubesIncoming/whonix-ws-16-clone-i2p/i2p/docs/startconsole.html<br>
Continue?”</p>
<p>Anyways I am sure I am missing a step or cant find the correct documentation and if anyone can chime in would be helpful!</p>

          <title>Systemcheck hangs up on Time Synchronization</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently updated Gateway and Workstation to 16.0.4 running out of Virtual Box. I had some connectivity issues and had to update usr/local/etc/torrc.d/50_user.conf</p>
<p>Now everything seems to work fine but I still can’t connect to Tor due to a Time Synchronization error. When I run systemcheck I get the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[ERROR] [systemcheck] Time Synchronization Result:<br>
systemcheck gave up waiting.</p>
<p>Time synchronization status: fail<br>
sdwdate reports: Maximum allowed number of failures. Giving up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Checking the sdwdate logs gives me some more info:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>START: ### /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/onion-time-pre-script</h3>
<p>__ Status: Subsequent run after boot.<br>
__ Static Time Sanity Check: Within minimum time ‘Fri Feb 18 00:00:00 UTC 2022’ and expiration timestamp ‘Tue May 17 10:00:00 UTC 2033’, ok.<br>
__ Tor reports: NOTICE BOOTSTRAP PROGRESS=100 TAG=done SUMMARY=“Done”<br>
__ Tor circuit: established<br>
__ Tor Consensus Time Sanity Check: Clock within consensus parameters consensus/valid-after 2022-11-28 14:00:00 and consensus/valid-until 2022-11-28 17:00:00.<br>
__ Conclusion: Tor already reports circuit established.<br>
__ ### END: ### Exiting with exit_code ‘0’ indicating ‘success’.<br>
2022-11-28 14:59:21 - sdwdate - INFO - PREPARATION RESULT: SUCCESS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when the Onions are pulled in to establish the time, all URLs produce the same error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ultimately ending with the summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - INFO - failed_urls: 9 allowed_failures: 7<br>
2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - ERROR - Maximum allowed number of failures. Giving up.<br>
2022-11-28 14:59:22 - sdwdate - INFO - Sleeping for 90 minutes, ok.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried restarting sdwdate, restarting network and restarting Tor via Gateway and Workstation. I’ve also tried setting the time/date manually but this didn’t fix anything. Can someone tell me where I’m going wrong?</p>

          <dc:creator><![CDATA[StevenT]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to open a second VM in my virtual machine (Oracle VirtualBox).</p>
<p>Then, in the second VM, I want to open a third VM.<br>
In the third VM I want to import the Whonix ova file and use Whonix.</p>
<p>Can you tell me please, what hardware requirements I need?</p>
<p>Should I buy Intel9 or Ryzen9?<br>
Do I need more than 32 GB of RAM?<br>
What specifications are important? What do I need?</p>
<p>Current problem:<br>
I tried to start Whonix in my current virtual machine.<br>
Importing the .ova file works. When starting Gateway it “<em>freezes</em>”.</p>
<p>Please help me. The Prices for the hardware doesn’t matter. The main thing is that I can open 3 or 4 virtual machines “inside each other” (Nested Virtualization) and use Whonix.</p>
<p>The strange thing is:<br>
If I open a second virtual machine with windows OS in a virtual machine, “inside each other” that works without problems. But Whonix freezes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>Hi, I was wondering if adding a NoScript icon to the toolbar affects my browser fingerprint, I do this in order to enable some necessary scripts for the site when the “Safest” security level is enabled.<br>
Does adding the icon to the toolbar and enabling selective scripts for some sites affect my fingerprint and anonymity?<br>
Or is it better not to do this and to use “Safer” mode if necessary?</p>

          <title>VPN After Tor Instructions DOES NOT WORK</title>

            <p>I made a throwaway account just for this. I’ve spent hours on this crap, and it just simply doesn’t work. Torbrowser continues to bypass the VPN.</p>
<p>This is going to be an upset post. Take it for what you want, but when you throw a ridiculous long set of commands that even a sysadmin who writes their own shell scripts for fun, finds tedious … You’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Why can’t you just bundle this as a SCRIPT, that users can just run???  You could just ask them to create a separate template VM, and run the setup script in that.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what the most ridiculous part of this guide is? This little box EVERY TIME describing sudoedit. This guide is wayy too long already, and it’s going to waste screen space describing stupid sudoedit like 20 times. Show it ONCE at the top of the instructions.</p>
<p>But moreover, I modified /etc/uwt.d/50_user.conf . I installed dante, carefully copying every single command. I even dropped them into #!/bin/sh so that I couldn’t screw it up. It all ran with no errors.</p>
<p>This is a pristine brand new never touched VM so it should JustWork™. But it doesnt. So I tried the OLD method (well actually 3 of the 4) and of course that didn’t work because Mozilla controls Tor, and they constantly and intentionally break everything with new releases to make everything more complicated.</p>
<p>I need a VPN after Tor for a couple very specific use cases, and I can’t, because this is broken.</p>
<p><em><strong>I have done this before on another Qubes install and it wasn’t this hard</strong></em>.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember changing some onion-grater setting in a whonix gateway, which is notably absent in this so guide. A guide which has been nothing but a waste of hours of time now.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ll just remove this post but please forward it to someone who can fix this. Nothing will make your users more upset than giving them hundreds of lines to read and follow, only for it to not work.</p>
<p>I mean ffs, in all the time it took someone to write that guide, they could’ve just written a script to implement it.</p>

<p>The fact we disable TCP timestamps and remove TCP ISNs is readily apparent.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The negatives of having TCP timestamps disabled (and other default TCP kernel options), especially in Gateway, is fingerprinting of linux-hardened users.</p>
<p>This is mainly problematic in Gateway since it is able to tie IPs to Whonix users by time sources, guard node or apt mirrors, but is also able to fingerprint Workstation to a lesser degree</p>
<p>This should be re-enabled but I would love to be proven wrong</p>

            <p>1)So there are 2 support options.  But it says pick an appropriate amount I believe.  so, I just select whatever option I want to pay?   Then that is $100 every 30 days, right?  That is the first question. Am I misunderstanding?  Is something not fully loading - how much do I pay.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>whonix — /wiki/VoIP Up until about 40 minutes ago, until I read that.  I thought myself and another person would somehow use whonix and skype to make fairly secure video calls.  I have personally been hacked twice over many years.   Paypal/Bank.  Both times money was returned and I was told to not ask more questions, just take the money be happy.  They did not allow me to ask if I did anything wrong or should do anything better.  Refunded, helped me.  Then told me keep using our stuff, bye…  Since them I use TOR.  It might be coincidental.  But I’ve had no more issues.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a bit of reading. It seems it will either be impossible to make video calls using a TOR/Whonix or rock the boat.  It feels like it might ‘violate’ terms of service or “expected use” policies.   If I use it for video it takes up too many resources.  I’d be happy to pay for premium support here and on tor(It does not exist there I know) but donate there…  However, I still think I would be told:  "It is not possible.  Or “we can’t really help you”.<br>
– Low Quality with occasional poor is not great but tolerable.  Upper Low/Medium<br>
– Short Duration and Frequency 1 60 minute call once a month</p>
<p>Am I correct in above statements?  Is there anything I can do, I tried to dig on my own for a little on my own.  also still curious about whonix support costs. I am sure I will need it for other things.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Free software version of static scanner widely known/used: 


Note: free version can be downloaded locally 
Or we can be integrated it into github and/or gitlab side as well but a request need to be filled: 




Coverity is static code scanner which can be integrated in github: 
Note: the integration free of cost, but the software is proprietary (but since its only added on github side i think its safe?)

          <title>Whonix-Workstation update problem - ERROR: Debian Package Update Check Result: Upgrade simulation failed!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Deneb007]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>When I use Whonix, I always start by doing a system check with the Systemcheck tool. This allows me to know if an update is necessary.<br>
I have never had a problem updating the Whonix-Gateway, but I am currently having a problem updating the Whonix-Workstation.<br>
Here is the error message displayed by Systemcheck:</p>
<p>ERROR: Debian Package Update Check Result: Upgrade simulation failed!</p>
<p>To fix, try running these commands:<br>
(Open a terminal, Start Menu → System → Terminal.)<br>
sudo dpkg --audit<br>
sudo dpkg --configure -a<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</p>
<p>Debugging information:<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate exit code: 100<br>
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade --simulate output:<br>
Reading package lists…<br>
Building dependency tree…<br>
Reading state information…<br>
You might want to run ‘apt --fix-broken install’ to correct these.<br>
The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
linux-headers-5.10.0-19-amd64 : Depends: linux-headers-5.10.0-19-common (= 5.10.149-2) but 5.10.149-1 is installed<br>
Depends: linux-kbuild-5.10 (&gt;= 5.10.149-2) but 5.10.149-1 is installed<br>
E: Unmet dependencies. Try ‘apt --fix-broken install’ with no packages (or specify a solution).<br>
If you know what you are doing, feel free to disable this check. Create a file /etc/systemcheck.d/50_user.conf and add:<br>
systemcheck_skip_functions+=" check_operating_system "</p>
<p>(I get the same error message when I try to update the Workstation using the following command: sudo apt-get-update-plus dist-upgrade)</p>
<p>So could someone help me to fix this update problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
