            <h2>
<a name="overview-1" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#overview-1"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>I have been doing some research on other FOSS privacy tool projects, and had a very nice conversation with a person who was on the <a href="http://privacyguides.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">privacyguides.org</a> team. He pointed out that UX/UI could be improved upon a lot on the main site/wiki, and thinks doing so would have a meaningful impact on usage and interest in Whonix.</p>
<p>I agree with this sentiment, and would like to help.</p>
<h4>
<a name="ideas-2" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#ideas-2"></a>Ideas</h4>
<p>Firstly, I think that many of the stock images and graphics take away a bit from the usability of the site. If you look at <a href="http://grapheneos.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">grapheneos.org</a>, it has a very simple layout with straightforward “click and install” front and center. I think something like this is a great idea for the Whonix site.</p>
<p>IMO many of the stock images and logos are a bit dated, and a little cheesy. This is not intended to be a dig at anyone who did this work, and the Whonix site is an AMAZING resource. I simply think it could benefit from a bit of tidying up.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am curious how the pages are hosted? The wiki is easy to find, but what about the home page? I think having a singular website repo using a static site generator (jekyll, hugo, etc) would be a good way to standardize the layout and increase maintainability. This would make it easier to focus on documentation and HTML/CSS separately.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think the welcome page in TOR should ask for donations front and center, in the same way that TAILS does. TAILS project kindly requests donations and saying something similar to this “Whonix is entirely free, and relies on user donations. If all users of Whonix gave just $5, we could make a great impact in keeping users free and secure for many years to come.”</p>
<h4>
<a name="commitment-3" class="anchor" href="http://forums.whonix.org#commitment-3"></a>Commitment</h4>
<p>After I get my CI project running WATS, I am happy to tackle this project, and get the site more concise and clean. My partner is a graphic designer, and I could probably get a little bit of help with some custom/unified graphics on some areas that might need them.</p>
<p>It would be nice as this unfolds to try to discern outdated information and what needs to be archived</p>

            <p>Hello, would love to see Whonix self hosting the git server.<br>
I have problems with github, they block certain providers and certain IPs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi,<br>
Thank you for contacting GitHub Support.<br>
Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.<br>
In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.<br>
Our Terms of Service state that an individual may not maintain more than one:<br>
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#3-account-requirements" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub Terms of Service - GitHub Docs</a><br>
We’ll need to leave this account flagged.<br>
Regards,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 reasons they replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our abuse detecting systems flagged this account because of the email address on the account. The email provider is not permitted for use on GitHub accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mail provider censor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to that, you appear to have registered multiple free user accounts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not try to create multiple free accounts.<br>
Probably IP based flag considering many people use the same exit node.</p>
<p>I chose an e-mail provider that does not require personal information nor signup without tor and could be done without javascript enabled.<br>
I could of course hop mail server till I find one that works, but that would solve the account problem, but not the bigger problem that is relying on github for everyone that wants to contribute and depending on giving enough information for 3rd party servers till they are satisfied.</p>
<p>I can of course try other git hosting solutions, but Whonix being hosted on a different server such as GitHub makes merge requests impossible, for someone to review the request, they would need to see a branch hosted on a different server and they would only be able to compare locally. Mail patches are also possible, but then that is a closed review process, with only one person seeing the patch before being applied, as there is not Whonix mailing list related to that.</p>
<p>Also, as discussions should happen here instead of git issues, the git server program does not need lots of features.</p>
<p>I hope this incite the git hosting to come sooner.</p>

            <p>Download speed issues have been reported by a few users even when downloading over clearnet.<br>
Therefore I wrote a script:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-check-mirrors" class="inline-onebox">developer-meta-files/dm-check-mirrors at master · Kicksecure/developer-meta-files · GitHub</a></p>
<p>And run it from a different server with a fast connection. (The Kicksecure server.)</p>
<p>Another server downloads a bit from <a href="http://whonix.org">whonix.org</a> and other <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Hosting_a_Mirror">Whonix download mirrors</a> for comparison.</p>
<p>Review of the <code>dm-check-mirrors</code> script is welcome.<br>
(It’s part of <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files">developer-meta-files</a> package.)</p>

            <p>For me the download usually takes a few hours.<br>
Even a tiny amount of compression would help with downloading the VM installation files.</p>
<p>I know there are some concerns from the Whonix dev team that adding more download options would make the download process more difficult for new users, however for me downloading is currently very difficult due to the time it takes. Adding a compressed download wouldn’t really hurt, I think it should be added.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This process can be repeated with socks proxies, but it is redundant and does not provide any advantage over the former types. The reason is because only Tor Browser is modified and no other programs are being tunneled through it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand this.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/cannot-add-socks-proxy-to-tor-browser/12728/3" class="inline-onebox">Cannot add SOCKS proxy to Tor Browser - #3 by motherhacker</a> these instructions have been improved just now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This process can be repeated with socks proxies, but it is redundant and does not provide any advantage over the former types. The reason is because only Tor Browser is modified and no other programs are being tunneled through it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>repeated</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies setting HTTP + HTTPS + SOCKS proxy settings?</p>
<p>Would someone wanting to configure a HTTPS proxy leave HTTP settings empty?</p>
<p>That seems application specific and there could be leak bugs in Firefox depending on the configuration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>socks … does not provide any advantage over the former types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature wise, clearly according to <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_Of_Tor_with_CGI_Proxies,_Proxy_Chains,_and_VPN_Services#Comparison_Tables_2">Comparison Tables</a> socks4a and socks5 are better.</p>
<p>We already cover that in <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tunnels/Connecting_to_Tor_before_a_proxy#Proxy_Warning">Proxy Warning</a> somewhat but perhaps a clear recommendation (despite all the warnings beforehand on remote proxies generally) “use socks5” should be spelled out?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Apply the following steps to avoid unexpected results such as broken connectivity and/or traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and only going through Tor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid traffic bypassing the tunnel-link and only going through Tor… Wouldn’t it be best to trust Tor Browser’s default settings and make only minimal modifications?</p>
<p>Tor Browser’s default settings are…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>network.proxy.socks	file:///run/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor/127.0.0.1_9150.sock	<br>
network.proxy.socks_port	0	<br>
network.proxy.socks_remote_dns	true	<br>
network.proxy.socks_version	5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>network.proxy.socks is modified in Whonix through use of an environment variable → <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor" class="inline-onebox">Dev/anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor - Whonix</a></p>
<p>From that perspective the most minimal change would be to use socks5 + modify <code>network.proxy.socks</code> + <code>network.proxy.socks_port</code> only.</p>
<p>Is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Set <code>network.proxy.no_proxies_on</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>still required or would it still be required?</p>

            <p>A user getting confused with footnotes: <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/configuring-whonix-16-qubes/12701" class="inline-onebox">configuring Whonix-16/Qubes</a></p>
<p>Could you add some documentation on how footnotes are used please?</p>
<p>How footnotes are currently used:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a developer notepad. If references such as links to related source code are difficult to find (on search engines or otherwise), then sometimes links are added.</li>
<li>For references for statements which are non-obvious such as factual statements: Before someone asks “Where is your evidence/source for that statement?”</li>
<li>Comments for auditors: An auditor likely, potentially wondering “Why Whonix recommends/does X, why not Y?”, “Is that secure?”, “Why not Z…?”</li>
<li>To express awareness of (usability) issues, existing, related discussions, linking to these. To avoid duplicate tickets and discussions.</li>
<li>“If you’re a user and getting confused, check if the footnotes are of any help before asking for support.” - This is useful for common cases where one group of users (for example new users) would be OK with the instructions (avoiding mentioning legacy) while another group of users (for example already existing users) might wonder “wasn’t this different previously, why did that change?”</li>
<li>Troubleshooting instructions.</li>
<li>For advanced users, additional documentation that would otherwise confuse most users?</li>
<li>Do we have sometimes additional instructions for most users?</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ul>
<p>What could be the general recommendation? “If you’re a novice user and want things to be as simple as possible, ignore the footnotes. If you want to explore things in more detail, question things and/or develop, please look at the related footnotes first.” Good?</p>
<p>Maybe here…?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>How come all my download attempts of whonix is failing?</p>
<p>No matter which kind of browser, internet connection, or download manager i try, it fails, by getting stuck at 5% 7% or if i am lucky 10%. I have even tried sitting in front of my browser clicking retry as many times as it stops. But in the end what happens is that it just choose to start from 0% again when i have clicked retry alot of times</p>
<p>If have no problems downloading files, and even OS’es that are more than 4GB from other sites</p>
<p>So it might likely be whonix who has troubles with the server that is hosting the file?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT tools like <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt-get.8.en.html">apt-get(8)</a></p>

<p>(<code>dist-upgrade</code> will always be available for compatibly with muscle memory, I think.)</p>

<p>Man page <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt-get.8.en.html:">https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/apt/apt-get.8.en.html:</a> apt-get is for use in scripts.</p>

<ul>
<li>apt dist-upgrade = apt full-upgrade</li>
<li>apt-get dist-upgrade = apt-get full-upgrade</li>

<p>apt has a progress meter in console, is slightly more appropriate for manual use however using apt-get instead has no disadvantage whatsoever (except no progress meter). It’s a question of taste only. No difference in security.</p>

<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>command line manual use: use apt (or apt-get)</li>
<li>in scripts: use apt-get, don’t use apt</li>

  <p>Yep, you heard it right, we have a few new security features and even some new Security Headers in town! Whilst technically only COOP, COEP, CORP and CORB are new, CORS is very related despite having been around for a while and is still very much...</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>With the rising quantum computers in the horizon, i think having a new page, about the threat quantum computers pose to Bitcoin, is worthwhile. I haven’t seen a full read, just some bits and pieces on the internet, i think bringing it all together can be very nice. I would like to write about this, with references to academic research and other reliable sources. Covering various things. What do you think?</p>

Answer: both are used.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>too much white space after headline</strong></s></p>
<p><s>example:</s><br>
<s><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Runtime_Guard_LKRG" class="inline-onebox">Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) for Debian, Whonix, Qubes, Kicksecure - Whonix</a></s></p>
<p><s>Between Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) and Introduction is too much whitespace.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>too much white space after top menu line</strong></s></p>
<p><s>Definition of <code>top menu line</code>:</s></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>HOME DOWNLOAD DOCS FAQ HELP CONTRIBUTE NEWS</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><s>Between the <code>top menu line</code> and the <code>donation banner</code> there is too much white space.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>uneven and too much white space in the wiki footer</strong></s></p>
<p><s>Sometimes there is too much white space between sections in the footer. For some sections there is more/less (uneven) white space.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>too much white space after table of contents</strong></s></p>
<p><s>For example on <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser" class="inline-onebox">Tor Browser Essentials</a> there is too much white space after the table of contents.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>too much white space before footer</strong></s></p>
<p><s>For example on <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox" class="inline-onebox">Whonix ™ for Windows, macOS, Linux inside VirtualBox</a> there is too much white space before the footer.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>remove blockquote extraneous newlines</strong></s></p>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Testpage#Blockquote_Test" class="inline-onebox">Testpage - Whonix</a><br>
<s>* A newline in the wiki markup after the opening <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tag should not result in an empty quote line in the generated html.</s>
</li>
<li><s>A newline in the wiki markup before the closing &lt;<code>/blockquote&gt;</code> tag should not result in an empty quote line in the generated html.</s></li>
<li><s>Should functional similar to the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>Should use:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="white-space: pre;"&gt;textstart
middle
textend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is not possible to add a newline before “textstart” and after “textend” for better readability for wiki editors.</p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>prettify download button</strong></s></p>

<hr>
<p><s><strong>mobile version: <code>top menu line</code> text not centered</strong></s></p>
<p><s>In the mobile version the text is not horizontally centered.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>mobile version: Missing project name in <code>top menu line</code></strong></s></p>
<p><s>In the mobile version there is no mention of Whonix in the top menu line.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>Missing project logo in top menu</strong></s></p>
<p><s>There should be the Whonix banner or logo in the top menu line or somewhere appropriate.</s></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>tables prettification</strong></p>
<p>For example on <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Windows_Hosts" class="inline-onebox">Microsoft Windows Hosts</a> the tables look a bit weird. One has to scroll down a lot (specifically on mobile) before having a chance to see what category it is about. Also the colors aren’t great.</p>
<p><strong>missing table scroll buttons</strong></p>
<p>When viewing <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Comparison_with_Others" class="inline-onebox">Anonymity Operating System Comparison - Whonix ™ vs Tails vs Tor Browser Bundle</a> on mobile it is not obvious that one can scroll the the right. Maybe a scroll button would help? Doesn’t need to be necessarily a scroll button. Also a different table style might be a better solution.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>table of contents too long</strong></p>
<p>On many wiki pages such as for example <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Browser" class="inline-onebox">Tor Browser Essentials</a> the table of contents seems too long before there is any actual content. Is there a better way to present this?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>documentation page</strong></p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to prettify <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation" class="inline-onebox">Whonix ™ Documentation</a>?</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to prettify <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Donate" class="inline-onebox">Donating to Whonix ™</a>?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>info box overlaps with thumbnail illustrative image</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Example: <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/VirtualBox/Recommended_Version" class="inline-onebox">Recommended VirtualBox Version for use with Whonix ™</a>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><s><strong>blockquote extraneous newline in the middle and lost spaces</strong></s></p>
<ul>
<li><s>See <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Testpage#Blockquote_Test" class="inline-onebox">Testpage - Whonix</a></s></li>
<li><s>There is an extraneous newline before the last line with text.</s></li>
<li><s>Some spaces in the middle are lost.</s></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Other Suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>Are there other stylistic changes that could be made?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Time to document multiple architecture support.</p>
<p>Distro morphing is probably already possible. We have power9, previously arm64 (RPi) and new arm64 (M1) support.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Porting#Existing_Ports_of_Whonix_.E2.84.A2">Existing Ports of Whonix ™</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Porting#Existing_Ports_of_Kicksecure_.E2.84.A2">Existing Ports of Kicksecure ™</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For example Kicksecure should easily work on power9 or arm64. Ready for call for testers soon.</p>
<p>Multiple platform support seems difficult documentation, usability wise. I don’t even know how to name the current builds which we got, “amd64”.</p>
<p>Calling them “amd64” would alienate Intel users. “amd64” meaning “also Intel” is one of the worst terms ever.</p>
<p>Also cannot call it “PC” since there are also google results for “ARM based PC” which means “PC” doesn’t exclusivity mean x86-64.</p>
<p>Calling it “x86-64” (has a wikipedia page with that name) is slightly better but still very confusing. I don’t know any laymen that know that they are using “x86-64”, “amd64”. People just know they have a notebook. I’ve seen laymen failing on the Debian download page due to this and ending up with Ubuntu or otherwise instead which is exclusively x86-64 without mentioning it prominently.</p>
<p>Libvirt file name has to change. Currently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure-XFCE-15.0.1.7.2.libvirt.xz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suggested new for <code>arm64</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure-XFCE-15.0.1.7.2.arm64.qcow2.libvirt.xz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Mentioning <code>qcow2</code> because <code>arm64</code> images initially will be only available as <code>raw</code> images.)</p>
<p>Suggested new for <code>amd64</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure-XFCE-15.0.1.7.2.Intel-AMD.qcow2.libvirt.xz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or use <code>PC</code> anyhow? Even though there are arm64 based PCs we can pretend the original PC architecture was x86, nowadays amd64, therefore reserved for that and other platforms should choose distinctive names.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure-XFCE-15.0.1.7.2.PC.qcow2.libvirt.xz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the website / in the wiki I would go as far as writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PC (Intel and AMD) (most users) | arm64</p>

            <p>The buttons for markup when making a post like bold etc all use SVG, which on TBB’s highest security setting do not display. Hovering over them I get their title though which makes them usable.</p>
<p>When making a post there is a button above the title and next to “Create a new Topic” which is empty, inspecting it I think it is some kind of dropdown menu, but I don’t know. Has id “ember1094”.</p>
<p>I don’t know of what importance this kind of “usability” is to the Whonix project, thought I’d bring it up though in case it is. If not that’s understandable, low hanging fruit here. The SVG stuff isn’t significant for security here since needing to enable JS to post anyway, which I dislike because of poor performance at least while on Tor, so more about usability again there, but I digress… lmao.</p>
